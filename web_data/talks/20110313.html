		<h1>Contours of Global Order: Domination, Instability, and Xenophobia in a Changing World</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky</h2>
<h3>Text of lecture given at <a href="http://www.chomsky.nl/chomsky-in-nederland-maart-2011/131-lezing-13-maart-van-noam-chomsky-in-de-westerkerk-in-amsterdam" target="_blank">Westerkerk, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</a>, March 13, 2011</h3>
<p>When we settled on the title for this talk, few could have guessed how apt it would prove to be when the time came &#8212; how dramatically the world would be changing, and how far-reaching are the implications for domestic and world order.</p>
<p>The democracy uprising in the Arab world has been a spectacular display of courage, dedication, and commitment by popular forces &#8212; coinciding, fortuitously, with a remarkable uprising of tens of thousands in support of working people and democracy in Madison Wisconsin and other US cities. One telling event occurred on Feb. 20, when Kamal Abbas send a message from Tahrir Square to Wisconsin workers, saying &#8220;We Stand With You as You Stood With Us.&#8221; Abbas is a leader of the years of struggle of Egyptian workers for elementary rights. His message of solidarity evoked the traditional aspiration of the labor movements: solidarity among workers of the world, and populations generally.</p>
<p>However flawed their record, labor movements have regularly been in the forefront of popular struggles for basic rights and democracy. In Tahrir Square, the streets of Madison, and many other places the popular struggles underway reach directly to the prospects for authentic democracy: for sociopolitical systems in which people are free and equal participants in controlling the institutions in which they live and work.</p>
<p>Right now, the trajectories in Cairo and Madison are intersecting, but headed in opposite directions: in Cairo towards gaining elementary rights denied by the dictatorships, in Madison towards defending rights that had been won in long and hard struggles and are now under severe attack. Each is a microcosm of tendencies in global society, following varied courses. There are sure to be far-reaching consequences of what is taking place both in the decaying industrial heartland of the richest and most powerful country in human history, and in what President Eisenhower called &#8220;the most strategically important area in the world&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;a stupendous source of strategic power&#8221; and &#8220;probably the richest economic prize in the world in the field of foreign investment&#8221; in the words of the State Department in the 1940s, a prize that the US intended to keep for itself and its allies in the unfolding New World Order of that day.</p>
<p>Despite all the changes since, there is every reason to suppose that today&#8217;s policy-makers basically adhere to the judgment of the influential Roosevelt advisor A.A. Berle that control of the incomparable energy reserves of the Middle East would yield &#8220;substantial control of the world.&#8221; And correspondingly, that loss of control would threaten the project of global dominance that was clearly articulated during World War II, and that has been sustained in the face of major changes in world order since that day.</p>
<p>From the outset of the war 1939, Washington anticipated that it would end with the US in a position of overwhelming power. High-level State Department officials and foreign policy specialists met through the wartime years to lay out plans for the postwar world. They delineated a &#8220;Grand Area&#8221; that the US was to dominate, including the Western hemisphere, the Far East, and the former British empire, with its Middle East energy resources. As Russia began to grind down Nazi armies after Stalingrad, Grand Area goals extended to as much of Eurasia as possible, at least its economic core in Western Europe. Within the Grand Area the US would maintain &#8220;unquestioned power,&#8221; with &#8220;military and economic supremacy,&#8221; while ensuring the &#8220;limitation of any exercise of sovereignty&#8221; by states that might interfere with its global designs. The careful wartime plans were soon implemented.</p>
<p>It was always recognized that Europe might choose to follow an independent course. NATO was partially intended to counter this threat. As soon as the official pretext for NATO dissolved in 1989, NATO was expanded to the East in violation of verbal pledges to Gorbachev. It has since become a US-run intervention force, with far-ranging scope, spelled out by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who informed a NATO conference that &#8220;NATO troops have to guard pipelines that transport oil and gas that is directed for the West,&#8221; and more generally to protect sea routes used by tankers and other &#8220;crucial infrastructure&#8221; of the energy system.</p>
<p>Grand Area doctrines clearly license military intervention at will. That conclusion was articulated clearly by the Clinton administration, which declared that the US has the right to use military force to ensure &#8220;uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources,&#8221; and must maintain huge military forces &#8220;forward deployed&#8221; in Europe and Asia &#8220;in order to shape people&#8217;s opinions about us&#8221; and &#8220;to shape events that will affect our livelihood and our security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same principles governed the invasion of Iraq. As US failure to impose its will in Iraq was becoming unmistakable, the actual goals of the invasion could no longer be concealed behind pretty rhetoric. In November 2007 the White House issued a Declaration of Principles demanding that US forces must remain indefinitely in Iraq and committing Iraq to privilege American investors. Two months later President Bush informed Congress that he would reject legislation that might limit the permanent stationing of US Armed Forces in Iraq or &#8220;United States control of the oil resources of Iraq&#8221; &#8212; demands that the US had to abandon shortly after in the face of Iraqi resistance.</p>
<p>In Tunisia and Egypt, the current popular uprising has won impressive victories, but as the Carnegie Endowment reported a few days ago, while names have changed, the regimes remain: &#8220;A change in ruling elites and system of governance is still a distant goal.&#8221; The report discusses internal barriers to democracy, but ignores the external ones, which as always are significant.</p>
<p>The US and its Western allies are sure to do whatever they can to prevent authentic democracy in the Arab world. To understand why, it is only necessary to look at the studies of Arab opinion conducted by US polling agencies. Though barely reported, they are certainly known to planners. They reveal that by overwhelming majorities, Arabs regard the US and Israel as the major threats they face: the US is so regarded by 90% of Egyptians, in the region generally over 3/4. Some regard Iran as a threat: 10%. Opposition to US policy is so strong that a majority believe that security would be improved if Iran had nuclear weapons &#8212; in Egypt 80%. Other figures are similar. If public opinion were to influence policy, the US not only would not control the region, but would be expelled from it, along with its allies, undermining fundamental principles of global dominance.</p>
<p>Support for democracy is the province of ideologists and propagandists. In the real world, elite dislike of democracy is the norm. The evidence is overwhelming that democracy is supported insofar as it contributes to social and economic objectives, a conclusion reluctantly conceded by the more serious scholarship.</p>
<p>Elite contempt for democracy was revealed dramatically in the reaction to the Wikileaks exposures. Those that received most attention, with euphoric commentary, were cables reporting that Arabs support the US stand on Iran. The reference was to the ruling dictators. The attitudes of the public were unmentioned. The guiding principle was articulated clearly by Carnegie Endowment Middle East specialist Marwan Muasher, formerly a high official of the Jordanian government: &#8220;there is nothing wrong, everything is under control.&#8221; In short, if the dictators support us, what else could matter?</p>
<p>The Muasher doctrine is rational and venerable. To mention just one case that is highly relevant today, in internal discussion in 1958, president Eisenhower expressed concern about &#8220;the campaign of hatred&#8221; against us in the Arab world, not by governments, but by the people. The National Security Council explained that there is a perception in the Arab world that the US supports dictatorships and blocks democracy and development, so as to ensure control over the resources of the region. Furthermore, the perception is basically accurate, the NSC concluded, and that is what we should be doing, relying on the Muasher doctrine. Pentagon studies conducted after 9/11 confirmed that the same holds today.</p>
<p>It is normal for the victors to consign history to the trash can, and for victims to take it seriously. Perhaps a few brief observations on this important matter may be useful. Today is not the first occasion when Egypt and the US are facing similar problems, and moving in opposite directions. That was also true in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Economic historians have argued that Egypt was well-placed to undertake rapid economic development at the same time that the US was. Both had rich agriculture, including cotton, the fuel of the early industrial revolution &#8212; though unlike Egypt, the US had to develop cotton production and a work force by conquest, extermination, and slavery, with consequences that are evident right now in the reservations for the survivors and the prisons that have rapidly expanded since the Reagan years to house the superfluous population left by deindustrialization. One fundamental difference was that the US had gained independence and was therefore free to ignore the prescriptions of economic theory, delivered at the time by Adam Smith in terms rather like those preached to developing societies today. Smith urged the liberated colonies to produce primary products for export and to import superior British manufactures, and certainly not to attempt to monopolize crucial goods, particularly cotton. Any other path &#8220;would retard instead of accelerating the further increase in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct instead of promoting the progress of their country towards real wealth and greatness,&#8221; Smith warned. Having gained their independence, the colonies were free to ignore his advice and to follow England&#8217;s course of independent state-guided development, with high tariffs to protect industry from British exports, first textiles, later steel and others, and to adopt numerous other devices to accelerate industrial development. The independent Republic also sought to gain a monopoly of cotton so as to &#8220;place all other nations at our feet,&#8221; particularly the British enemy, as the Jacksonian presidents announced when conquering Texas and half of Mexico.</p>
<p>For Egypt, a comparable course was barred by British power. Lord Palmerston declared that &#8220;no ideas of fairness [toward Egypt] ought to stand in the way of such great and paramount interests&#8221; of Britain as preserving its economic and political hegemony, expressing his &#8220;hate&#8221; for the &#8220;ignorant barbarian&#8221; Muhammed Ali who dared to seek an independent course, and deploying Britain&#8217;s fleet and financial power to terminate Egypt&#8217;s quest for independence and economic development.</p>
<p>After World War II, when the US displaced Britain as global hegemon, Washington adopted the same stand, making it clear that the US would provide no aid to Egypt unless it adhered to the standard rules for the weak &#8212; which the US continued to violate, imposing high tariffs to bar Egyptian cotton and causing a debilitating dollar shortage. The usual interpretation of market principles.</p>
<p>It is small wonder that the &#8220;campaign of hatred&#8221; against the US that concerned Eisenhower was based on the recognition that the US supports dictators and blocks democracy and development, as do its allies.</p>
<p>In Adam Smith&#8217;s defense, it should be added that he recognized what would happen if Britain followed the rules of sound economics &#8212; now called &#8220;neoliberalism.&#8221; He warned that if British manufacturers, merchants, and investors turned abroad, they might profit but England would suffer. But he felt that they would be guided by a home bias, so as if by an invisible hand England would be spared the ravages of economic rationality. The passage is hard to miss. It is the one occurrence of the famous phrase &#8220;invisible hand&#8221; in Wealth of Nations. The other leading founder of classical economics, David Ricardo, drew similar conclusions, hoping that home bias would lead men of property to &#8220;be satisfied with the low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations,&#8221; feelings that &#8220;I should be sorry to see weakened,&#8221; he added. Their predictions aside, the instincts of the classical economists were sound.</p>
<p>The democracy uprising in the Arab world is sometimes compared to Eastern Europe in 1989, but on dubious grounds. In 1989, the democracy uprising was tolerated by the Russians, and supported by western power in accord with standard doctrine: it plainly conformed to economic and strategic objectives, and was therefore a noble achievement, greatly honored, unlike the struggles at the same time &#8220;to defend the people&#8217;s fundamental human rights&#8221; in Central America, in the words of the assassinated Archbishop of El Salvador, one of the hundreds of thousands of victims of the military forces armed and trained by Washington. There was no Gorbachev in the West throughout these horrendous years, and there is none today. And Western power remains hostile to democracy in the Arab world for good reasons.</p>
<p>Grand Area doctrines continue to apply to contemporary crises and confrontations. In Western policy-making circles and political commentary the Iranian threat is considered to pose the greatest danger to world order and hence must be the primary focus of US foreign policy, with Europe trailing along politely. What exactly is the Iranian threat? An authoritative answer is provided by the Pentagon and US intelligence. Reporting on global security last year, they make it clear that the threat is not military. Iran&#8217;s military spending is &#8220;relatively low compared to the rest of the region,&#8221; they conclude. Its military doctrine is strictly &#8220;defensive, designed to slow an invasion and force a diplomatic solution to hostilities.&#8221; Iran has only &#8220;a limited capability to project force beyond its borders.&#8221; With regard to the nuclear option, &#8220;Iran&#8217;s nuclear program and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy.&#8221; All quotes.</p>
<p>The brutal clerical regime is doubtless a threat to its own people, though it hardly outranks US allies in that regard. But the threat lies elsewhere, and is ominous indeed. One element is Iran&#8217;s potential deterrent capacity, an illegitimate exercise of sovereignty that might interfere with US freedom of action in the region. It is glaringly obvious why Iran would seek a deterrent capacity; a look at the military bases and nuclear forces in the region suffices to explain. Seven years ago, Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld wrote that &#8220;The world has witnessed how the United States attacked Iraq for, as it turned out, no reason at all. Had the Iranians not tried to build nuclear weapons, they would be crazy,&#8221; particularly when they are under constant threat of attack in violation of the UN Charter. Whether they are doing so remains an open question, but perhaps so.</p>
<p>But Iran&#8217;s threat goes beyond deterrence. It is also seeking to expand its influence in neighboring countries, the Pentagon and Intelligence emphasize, and in this way to &#8220;destabilize&#8221; the region, in the technical terms of foreign policy discourse. US invasion and military occupation of Iran&#8217;s neighbors is &#8220;stabilization.&#8221; Iran&#8217;s efforts to extend its influence to them is &#8220;destabilization,&#8221; hence plainly illegitimate. Such usage is routine. Thus the prominent foreign policy analyst James Chace was properly using the term &#8220;stability&#8221; in its technical sense when he explained that in order to achieve &#8220;stability&#8221; in Chile it was necessary to &#8220;destabilize&#8221; the country (by overthrowing the elected Allende government and installing the Pinochet dictatorship). Other concerns about Iran are equally interesting to explore, but perhaps this is enough to reveal the guiding principles and their status in imperial culture; as FDR&#8217;s planners emphasized at the dawn of the contemporary world system, the US cannot tolerate &#8220;any exercise of sovereignty&#8221; that interferes with its global designs.</p>
<p>The US and Europe are united in punishing Iran for its threat to stability, but it is useful to recall how isolated they are. The nonaligned countries have vigorously supported Iran&#8217;s right to enrich uranium. In the region, Arab public opinion even strongly favors Iranian nuclear weapons. The major regional power, Turkey, voted against the latest US-intiated sanctions motion in the Security Council, along with Brazil, the most admired country of the South. Their disobedience led to sharp censure, not for the first time: Turkey had been bitterly condemned in 2003 when the government followed the will of 95% of the population and refused to participate in the invasion of Iraq, thus demonstrating its weak grasp of democracy, western-style. After its Security Council misdeed last year, Turkey was warned by Obama&#8217;s top diplomat on European affairs, Philip Gordon, that it must &#8220;demonstrate its commitment to partnership with the West.&#8221; A scholar with the Council on Foreign Relations asked &#8220;How do we keep the Turks in their lane?&#8221; &#8212; following orders like good democrats. Brazil&#8217;s Lula was admonished in a New York Times headline that his effort with Turkey to provide a solution to the uranium enrichment issue outside of the framework of US power is a &#8220;Spot on Brazilian Leader&#8217;s Legacy.&#8221; In brief, do what we say, or else.</p>
<p>An interesting sidelight, effectively suppressed, is that the Iran-Turkey-Brazil deal was approved in advance by Obama, presumably on the assumption that it would fail, providing an ideological weapon against Iran. When it succeeded, the approval turned to censure, and Washington rammed through a Security Council resolution so weak that China readily signed &#8212; and is now chastised for living up to the letter of the resolution but not Washington&#8217;s unilateral directives &#8212; in the current issue of Foreign Affairs for example.</p>
<p>While the US can tolerate Turkish disobedience, though with dismay, China is harder to ignore. The press warns that &#8220;China&#8217;s investors and traders are now filling a vacuum in Iran as businesses from many other nations, especially in Europe, pull out,&#8221; and in particular, is expanding its dominant role in Iran&#8217;s energy industries. Washington is reacting with a touch of desperation. The State Department warned China that it if it wants to be accepted in the international community &#8212; a technical term referring to the US and whoever happens to agree with it &#8212; than it must not &#8220;skirt and evade international responsibilities, [which] are clear&#8221;: namely, follow US orders. China is unlikely to be impressed.</p>
<p>There is also much concern about the growing Chinese military threat. A recent Pentagon study warned that China&#8217;s military budget is approaching &#8220;one-fifth of what the Pentagon spent to operate and carry out the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,&#8221; a fraction of the US military budget of course. China&#8217;s expansion of military forces might &#8220;deny the ability of American warships to operate in international waters off its coast,&#8221; The New York Times added. Off the coast of China, that is; it has yet to be proposed that that the US should eliminate military forces that deny the Caribbean to Chinese warships. China&#8217;s lack of understanding of rules of international civility is illustrated further by its objections to plans for the advanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington to join naval exercises a few miles off China&#8217;s coast, with alleged capacity to strike Beijing. In contrast, the West understands that such US operations are all undertaken to defend stability and its own security. The liberal New Republic expresses its concern that &#8220;China sent ten warships through international waters just off the Japanese island of Okinawa.&#8221; That is indeed a provocation &#8212; unlike the fact, unmentioned, that Washington has converted the island into a major military base, in defiance of vehement protests by the people of Okinawa. That is not a provocation, on the standard principle that we own the world.</p>
<p>Deep-seated imperial doctrine aside, there is good reason for China&#8217;s neighbors to be concerned about its growing military and commercial power. And though Arab opinion supports an Iranian nuclear weapons program, we certainly should not do so. The foreign policy literature is full of proposals as to how to counter the threat. One obvious way is rarely discussed: work to establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region. The issue arose (again) at the NPT conference at United Nations headquarters last May. Egypt, as chair of the 118 nations of the Non-Aligned Movement, called for negotiations on a Middle East NWFZ, as had been agreed by the West, including the US, at the 1995 review conference on the NPT. International support is so overwhelming that Obama formally agreed. It is a fine idea, Washington informed the conference, but not now. Furthermore, the US made clear Israel must be exempted: no proposal can call for Israel&#8217;s nuclear program to be placed under the auspices of the IAEA or for release of information about &#8220;Israeli nuclear facilities and activities.&#8221; So much for this method of dealing with the Iranian nuclear threat.</p>
<p>While Grand Area doctrine still prevails, the capacity to implement it has declined. The peak of US power was after World War II, when the US had literally half the world&#8217;s wealth. But that naturally declined, as other industrial economies recovered from the devastation of the war and decolonization took its agonizing course. By the early 1970s, US share of global wealth had declined to about 25%, and the industrial world had become tripolar: North America, Europe, and East Asia, then Japan-based.</p>
<p>There was also a sharp change in the US economy in the 1970s, towards financialization and export of production. There is no time to go into the details, but a variety of factors converged to create a vicious cycle of radical concentration of wealth, primarily in the top fraction of 1% of the population &#8212; mostly CEOs, hedge fund managers, and the like. That leads to concentration of political power, hence state policies to increase economic concentration: fiscal policies, rules of corporate governance, deregulation, and much more. Meanwhile the costs of electoral campaigns skyrocketed, driving the parties into the pockets of concentrated capital, increasingly financial: the Republicans reflexively, the Democrats &#8212; by now what used to be moderate Republicans &#8212; not far behind. Elections have become a charade, run by the public relations industry. After his 2008 victory, Obama won an award from the industry for the best marketing campaign of the year. Executives were euphoric. In the business press they explained that they had been marketing candidates like other commodities since Reagan, but 2008 was their greatest achievement, and would change the style in corporate boardrooms. The 2012 election is expected to cost $2 billion, mostly corporate funding. Small wonder that Obama is selecting business leaders for top positions. The public is angry and frustrated, but as long as the Muasher principle prevails, that doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>While wealth and power have narrowly concentrated, for most of the population real incomes have stagnated and people have been getting by with increased work hours, debt, and asset inflation, regularly destroyed by the financial crises that began as the regulatory apparatus was dismantled from the 1980s.</p>
<p>None of this is problematic for the very wealthy, who benefit from a government insurance policy, called &#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; The banks and investment firms can make risky transactions, with rich rewards, and when the system inevitably crashes, they can run to the nanny state for a taxpayer bailout, clutching their copies of Hayek and Milton Friedman. That has been the regular process since the Reagan years, each crisis more extreme than the last &#8212; for the public population, that is. Right now real unemployment is at Depression levels for much of the population, while Goldman Sachs, one of the main architects of the current crisis, is richer than ever. It has just quietly announced $17.5 billion in compensation for last year, with CEO Lloyd Blankfein receiving a $12.6 million bonus while his base salary more than triples.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t do to focus attention on such facts as these. Accordingly, propaganda must seek to blame others, in the past few months, public sector workers, their fat salaries, exorbitant pensions and so on: all fantasy, on the model of Reaganite imagery of black mothers being driven in their limousines to pick up welfare checks &#8212; and other models that need not be mentioned. We all must tighten our belts; almost all, that is.</p>
<p>Teachers are a particularly good target, as part of the deliberate effort to destroy the public education system, from kindergarten through the universities, by privatization &#8212; again, good for the wealthy, but a disaster for the population, as well as the long-term health of the economy, but that is one of the externalities that is put to the side insofar as market principles prevail.</p>
<p>Another fine target, always, is immigrants. That has been true throughout US history, even more so at times of economic crisis, exacerbated now by a sense that our country is being taken away from us: the white population will soon become a minority. One can understand the anger of aggrieved individuals, but the cruelty of the policy is shocking. Who are the immigrants targeted? In Eastern Massachusetts, where I live, many are Mayans fleeing genocide in the Guatemalan highlands carried out by Reagan&#8217;s favorite killers. Others are Mexican victims of Clinton&#8217;s NAFTA, one of those rare government agreements that managed to harm working people in all three of the participating countries. As NAFTA was rammed through Congress over popular objection in 1994, Clinton also initiated the militarization of the US-Mexican border, previously fairly open. It was understood that Mexican campesinos cannot compete with highly-subsidized US agribusiness, and that Mexican businesses would not survive competition with US multinationals, which must be granted &#8220;national treatment&#8221; under the mislabeled free trade agreements, a privilege granted only to corporate persons, not those of flesh and blood. Not surprisingly, these measures led to a flood of desperate refugees, and to rising anti-immigrant hysteria by the victims of state-corporate policies at home.</p>
<p>Much the same appears to be happening in Europe, where racism is probably more rampant than in the US. One can only watch with wonder as Italy complains about the flow of refugees from Libya, the scene of the first post-World War I genocide, in the now-liberated East, at the hands of Italy&#8217;s Fascist government. Or when France, which still today is the main protector of the brutal dictatorships in its former colonies, manages to overlook its hideous atrocities in Africa while Sarkozy warns grimly of the &#8220;flood of immigrants&#8221; and Marine Le Pen objects that he is doing nothing to prevent it. I need not mention Belgium, which may win the prize for what Adam Smith called &#8220;the savage injustice of the Europeans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rise of neo-fascist parties in much of Europe would be a frightening phenomenon even if we were not to recall what happened on the continent in the recent past. Just imagine the reaction if Jews were being expelled from France to misery and oppression, and then witness the non-reaction when that is happening to Roma, also victims of the Holocaust and Europe&#8217;s most brutalized population. In Hungary, the neo-fascist party Jobbik gained 17% of the vote in national elections &#8212; perhaps unsurprising when ¾ of the population feels that they are worse off than under Communist rule. We might be relieved that in Austria the ultra-right Jörg Haider won only 10% of the vote in 2008 &#8212; were it not for the fact that the new Freedom Party, outflanking him from the far right, won over 17%. It is chilling to recall that in 1928, the Nazis won less than 3% of the vote in Germany. In England the British National Party and the English Defence League, on the ultra-racist right, are major forces. What is happening in Holland you know all too well. In Germany, Thilo Sarrazin&#8217;s lament that immigrants are destroying Germany was a runaway best-seller, while Chancellor Angela Merkel, though condemning the book, declared that multiculturalism had &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;: the Turks imported to do the dirty work in Germany are failing to become blond and blue-eyed, true Aryans. Those with a sense of irony may recall that Benjamin Franklin, one of the leading figures of the Enlightenment, warned that the newly liberated colonies should be wary of allowing Germans to immigrate, because they are too swarthy; Swedes as well. Into the 20th century ludicrous myths of Anglo-Saxon purity were common in the US, including presidents and other leading figures. Racism in the literary culture has been a rank obscenity; far worse in practice, needless to say. It is much easier to eradicate polio than this horrifying plague, which regularly becomes more virulent in times of economic distress.</p>
<p>I have barely skimmed the surface of these critical issues, but do not want to end without mentioning another externality that is dismissed in market systems: the fate of the species. Systemic risk in the financial system can be remedied by the taxpayer, but no one will come to the rescue if the environment is destroyed. That it must be destroyed is close to an institutional imperative. Business leaders who are conducting propaganda campaigns to convince the population that anthropogenic global warming is a liberal hoax understand full well how grave is the threat. But they must maximize short-term profit and market share; if they don&#8217;t, someone else will. This vicious cycle could well turn out to be lethal. To see how grave the danger is, simply have a look at the new Congress in the US, propelled into power by business funding and propaganda. Almost all are climate deniers. They have already begun to cut funding for measures that might mitigate environmental catastrophe. Worse, some are true believers, for example the new head of a subcommittee on the environment who explained that global warming cannot be a problem because God promised Noah that there will not be another flood. If such things were happening in some small and remote country, we might laugh. Not when they are happening in the richest and most powerful country in the world. And before we laugh, we might also bear in mind that the current economic crisis is traceable in no small measure to the fanatic faith in such dogmas as the efficient market hypothesis, and in general to what Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, 15 years ago, called the &#8220;religion&#8221; that markets know best &#8212; which prevented the central bank and the economics profession from taking notice of an $8 trillion housing bubble that had no basis at all in economic fundamentals, and that devastated the economy when it burst.</p>
<p>All of this, and much more, can proceed as long as the Muashar doctrine prevails. As long as the general population is passive, apathetic, diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable, then the powerful can do as they please, and those who survive will be left to contemplate the outcome.</p>
