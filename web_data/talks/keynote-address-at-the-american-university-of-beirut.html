		<h1>Keynote Address at the American University of Beirut</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/commencement/Documents/speeches-13/chomsky-june-15.pdf">American University of Beirut</a>, June 15, 2014</h2>
<p>With wrenching tragedies only a few miles away, and still worse catastrophes<br />
perhaps not far removed, it may seem wrong, perhaps even cruel, to shift attention<br />
to what may seem to be more abstract prospects, uncertain ones, but ones that<br />
might offer a path to a better world – and not in the remote future.<br />
I’ve visited Lebanon several times, moments of great hope, and also of despair,<br />
tinged with remarkable determination to overcome and to move forward. The first<br />
time I visited – if that’s the right word – was exactly 60 years ago, almost to the<br />
day. My wife and I were hiking in Israel’s northern Galilee one evening, when a<br />
jeep drove by on a road near us and someone called out that we should turn back:<br />
we’re in the wrong country. We had, inadvertently, crossed the border, then<br />
unmarked, now I suppose bristling with lethal armaments.</p>
<p>A minor event, but it brought home forcefully a lesson that I knew, but perhaps not<br />
clearly enough. The legitimacy of borders – for that matter of states – is at best<br />
conditional and temporary. Neither have inherent legitimacy. Almost all borders<br />
have been imposed and maintained by violence, and are quite arbitrary. The<br />
Lebanon-Israel border was established in the interests of British and French<br />
imperial power, with no concern for the humans who happened to live there, or<br />
even the terrain. It makes no sense, which is why it was so easy to cross<br />
unwittingly.</p>
<p>Surveying the terrible conflicts in the world, almost all are the residue of imperial<br />
crimes and the borders they drew in their own interests. To take just one of many,<br />
Pashtuns have never accepted the legitimacy of the Durand line, drawn by Britain<br />
to separate Pakistan from Afghanistan; nor has any Afghan government ever<br />
accepted it. It is in the interests of today’s imperial powers that Pashtuns crossing<br />
it are labeled “terrorists” so that their homes are subjected to murderous attack by<br />
drones and special forces under President Obama’s global terrorist campaign.<br />
Much the same is true worldwide.</p>
<p>There are few borders in the world so heavily guarded by sophisticated technology,<br />
and so subject to impassioned domestic rhetoric, as the border separating Mexico<br />
from the United States, two countries with amicable diplomatic relations. The<br />
border was as usual established by violent aggression, the most wicked war in<br />
history, in the words of General Ulysses S. Grant, later President, who fought in it<br />
as a young officer. The border was fairly open until 1994, when President Clinton<br />
initiated Operation Gatekeeper, militarizing it. Before, people had regularly<br />
crossed to see relatives and friends. It is likely that Operation Gatekeeper was<br />
motivated by another event in that year, imposition of NAFTA, the mislabeled<br />
“free trade agreement” – and the term “imposition” is accurate since the<br />
populations of the participating countries were opposed. Doubtless the<br />
administration understood that Mexican farmers, however efficient they might be,<br />
cannot compete with highly subsidized US agribusiness, and that Mexican<br />
businesses cannot compete with US multinationals, which must receive “national<br />
treatment” in Mexico under the NAFTA rules. That would almost inevitably lead<br />
to a flood of refugees across the border, joining those who to this day are fleeing<br />
from the ravages of Reagan’s murderous wars in Central America in the 1980s.</p>
<p>There are indications of erosion of borders and the cruel hatreds and conflicts they<br />
symbolize and inspire. The most dramatic case is Europe. For centuries, Europe<br />
was the most savage region in the world, torn by hideous and destructive wars. In<br />
the 17th-century Thirty Years War alone perhaps a third of the population of<br />
Germany was wiped out. It was during these years of horror that Europe<br />
developed the technology and the culture of war that enabled it to conquer the<br />
world. After a final burst of indescribable savagery, the mutual destruction came<br />
to an end in 1945. Scholarship attributes that outcome to the thesis of democratic<br />
peace, but one major factor surely was that Europeans by then understood that they<br />
had developed such capacities for destruction that the next time they played their<br />
favorite game of slaughtering one another would be the last. The closer integration<br />
that has developed since is not without serious problems, as we see right now, but<br />
it is a vast improvement over what came before.</p>
<p>A similar outcome would hardly be strange for this region, which until recently<br />
was essentially borderless. And it is happening, though in awful ways. Syria’s<br />
seemingly inexorable plunge to suicide is tearing the country apart. And there is<br />
reason to take seriously the prediction of veteran Middle East correspondent<br />
Patrick Cockburn that the conflagration and its regional impact may lead to the end<br />
of the Sykes-Picot regime imposed a century ago by Britain and France. The<br />
Syrian civil war has reignited the Sunni-Shia conflict that was one of the most<br />
terrible consequences of the US-UK invasion of Iraq ten years ago – and we should<br />
never forget that the Nuremberg judgment, which forms a core part of modern<br />
international law, described aggression as the “supreme international crime,”<br />
differing from other war crimes in that it encompasses all of the evil that followed.<br />
The Kurdish regions of Iraq and now Syria are moving towards autonomy and<br />
linkages. Many analysts now predict that a Kurdish state may be established<br />
before a Palestinian state. If Palestine ever does gain independence in something<br />
like the terms of the overwhelming international consensus, it is likely that its<br />
borders with Israel will erode through normal processes of commercial and cultural<br />
interchange, as had begun to happen in the past during periods of relative calm.<br />
Anyone familiar with Mandatory Palestine knows well how artificial and<br />
disruptive any partition must be.</p>
<p>That development could be a step towards closer regional integration, and perhaps<br />
slow disappearance of the artificial border cutting the Galilee between Israel and<br />
Lebanon, so hikers and others could do what we did 60 years ago. Without<br />
pursuing details, this seems to me to offer the only realistic hope for some partial<br />
resolution of the plight of Palestinian refugees, now only one of the refugee<br />
disasters tormenting the region since the invasion of Iraq and Syria’s descent into<br />
hell.</p>
<p>Blurring of borders and challenges to the legitimacy of states bring to the fore<br />
serious questions about who owns the earth. Who owns the global atmosphere that<br />
is being polluted by the heat-trapping gasses that have now “passed a long-feared<br />
milestone,… reaching a concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years,”<br />
with awesome potential consequences, so we learned a month ago? Or to adopt the<br />
phrase used by indigenous people throughout much of the world, who will defend<br />
the earth? Who will uphold the rights of nature? Who will adopt the role of<br />
stewards of the commons, our collective possession? That the earth now<br />
desperately needs defense from impending environmental catastrophe is surely<br />
obvious to any rational and literate person. The differential reactions to the crisis<br />
are a most remarkable feature of current history. In the forefront of the defense of<br />
nature are those called “primitive”: indigenous, tribal, First Nations in Canada,<br />
aboriginal in Australia, and in general the remnants who have survived the imperial<br />
onslaught. In the forefront of the assault on nature are those who call themselves<br />
the most advanced and civilized, the richest and most powerful nations.</p>
<p>The struggle to defend the commons takes many forms. In microcosm, it is taking<br />
place right now in Taksim Square, where brave men and women are protecting the<br />
last remnants of the commons of Istanbul from the wrecking ball of<br />
commercialization and gentrification and autocratic rule that is destroying this<br />
ancient treasure. As the mainstream press has come to recognize, theirs is “the cry<br />
of those who want to have their voices heard, who want to have a say in how they<br />
are governed.” The conflict over the remnants of the commons is “about control<br />
versus freedom &#8230; What’s at stake is more than a square. It’s the soul of a nation.”</p>
<p>Given Turkey’s prominence, the outcome of the struggle is sure to have a large<br />
impact on others throughout the region. But even more than that: the defenders of<br />
Taksim Square today are at the forefront of a worldwide struggle to defend the<br />
global commons from the ravages of that same wrecking ball – a struggle in which<br />
we must all take part, with dedication and resolve, if there is any hope for decent<br />
human survival in a world that has no borders, and is our common possession, to<br />
defend or to destroy.</p>
