		<h1>On Vaclav Havel Speech</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky</h2>
<h3>Excerpted from Alexander Cockburn, <i>The Golden Age Is In Us</i>, Verso, 1995, pp. 149-151 [March 1, 1990]</h3>
<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>As a good and loyal friend, I can&#8217;t overlook this chance to suggest to you a marvelous way to discredit yourself completely and lose the last minimal shreds of respectability that still raise lingering questions about your integrity. I have in mind what I think is one of the most illuminating examples of the total and complete intellectual and moral corruption of Western culture, namely, the awed response to Vaclav Havel&#8217;s embarrassingly silly and morally repugnant Sunday School sermon in Congress the other day. We may put aside the intellectual level of the comments (and the response) &#8212; for example, the profound and startlingly original idea that people should be moral agents. More interesting are the phrases that really captured the imagination and aroused the passions of Congress, editorial writers, and columnists &#8212; and, doubtless, soon the commentators in the weeklies and monthlies: that we should assume responsibility not only for ourselves, our families, and our nations, but for others who are suffering and persecuted. This remarkable and novel insight was followed by the key phrase of the speech: the cold war, now thankfully put to rest, was a conflict between two superpowers: one, a nightmare, the other, the defender of freedom (great applause).</p>
<p>Reading it brought to mind a number of past experiences in Southeast Asia, Central America, the West Bank, and even a kibbutz in Israel where I lived in 1953 &#8212; Mapam, super-Stalinist even to the extent of justifying the anti-Semitic doctor&#8217;s plot, still under the impact of the image of the USSR as the leader of the anti-Nazi resistance struggle. I recall remarks by a Fatherland Front leader in a remote village in Vietnam, Palestinian organizers, etc., describing the USSR as the hope for the oppressed and the US government as the brutal oppressor of the human race. If these people had made it to the Supreme Soviet they doubtless would have been greeted with great applause as they delivered this message, and probably some hack in <i> Pravda</i> would have swallowed his disgust and written a ritual ode.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to equate a Vietnamese villager to Vaclav Havel. For one thing, I doubt that the former would have had the supreme hypocrisy and audacity to clothe his praise for the defenders of freedom with gushing about responsibility for the human race. It&#8217;s also unnecessary to point out to the half a dozen or so sane people who remain that in comparison to the conditions imposed by US tyranny and violence, East Europe under Russian rule was practically a paradise. Furthermore, one can easily understand why an oppressed Third World victim would have little access to any information (or would care little about anything) beyond the narrow struggle for survival against a terrorist superpower and its clients. And the <i> Pravda</i> hack, unlike his US clones, would have faced a harsh response if he told the obvious truths. So by every conceivable standard, the performance of Havel, Congress, the media, and (we may safely predict, without what will soon appear) the Western intellectual community at large are on a moral and intellectual level that is vastly below that of Third World peasants and Stalinist hacks &#8212; not an unusual discovery.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be argued in Havel&#8217;s defense that this shameful performance was all tongue in cheek, just a way to extort money from the American taxpayer for his (relatively rich) country. I doubt it, however; he doesn&#8217;t look like that good an actor.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the perfect swan song. It&#8217;s all absolutely true, even truistic. Writing something that true and significant would also have a predictable effect. The sign of a truly totalitarian culture is that important truths simply lack cognitive meaning and are interpretable only at the level of &#8216;Fuck You&#8217;, so they can then elicit a perfectly predictable torrent of abuse in response. We&#8217;ve long ago reached that level &#8212; to take a personal example, consider the statement: &#8216;We ought to tell the truth about Cambodia and Timor.&#8217; Or imagine a columnist writing: &#8216;I think the Sandinistas ought to win.&#8217; I suspect that this case is even clearer. It&#8217;s easy to predict the reaction to any truthful and honest comments about this episode, which is so revealing about the easy acceptance of (and even praise for) the most monstrous savagery, as long as it is perpetrated by Us against Them &#8212; a stance adopted quite mindlessly by Havel, who plainly shares the utter contempt for the lower orders that is the hallmark of Western intellectuals, so at least he&#8217;s &#8216;one of us&#8217; in that respect.</p>
<p>Anyway, don&#8217;t say I never gave you a useful suggestion.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Noam</p>
