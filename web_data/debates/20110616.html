		<h1>The Golden Age — A Look at the Original Roots of Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Neuroscience (partial transcript)</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky</h2>
<h3><i><a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PinkerChomskyMIT.html" target="_blank">MIT150 Symposia: Brains, Minds and Machines Symposium</a></i>, June 16, 2011</h3>
<p>Steven Pinker: Um I have a question for uh both Noam and Martin,<br />
that I think is on the minds of many people in this room, and I know it&#8217;s been expressed<br />
in some of the questions that I&#8217;ve received by email prior to this event,<br />
that there is a- a narrative in which the new direction of uh both artificial intelligence and cognitive science<br />
is one that makes a great deal more use of probabilistic information<br />
that is gleaned from enormous amounts of uh experience during learning &#8211;<br />
this is uh uh manifested in branches of cognitive science such as uh neural networks and connectionism,<br />
bayesian inference models, uh application of machine learning to intelligence,<br />
many of the models both of Tommy Poggio and Josh Tennenbaum.<br />
Uh in the classic work from the Golden Age, and indeed in many of the models since then,<br />
including the models of generative grammar and models of semantic memory,<br />
uh probabilities don&#8217;t play a big role.<br />
Uh is the narrative that says that the direction of the field is in<br />
making use of massive amounts of statistical information via learning<br />
uh well maybe I&#8217;ll ask you to complete that sentence.<br />
Uh what is the uh ((uh)) well I&#8217;ll let you complete the sentence. Noam?</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky: Well there&#8217;s a-<br />
uh fir- it&#8217;s- um it&#8217;s true there&#8217;s been a lot of work on um trying to apply<br />
uh statistical uh models to various linguistic problems<br />
uh I think there have been some successes, but a lot of failures.<br />
Uh the successes to my knowledge, at least, and there&#8217;s no time to go into details,<br />
the successes that I know of are those that integrate statistical analysis<br />
with some uh ((uh u-)) universal grammar properties, some fundamental properties of language;<br />
when they&#8217;re integrated, you sometimes do get results.<br />
Uh it&#8217;s uh ((uh uh the)) simplest case maybe is uh<br />
uh the problem of uh identifying words in a running discourse,<br />
something apparently children do, you know, they hear a running discourse, they pick out units,<br />
and the obvious units are words, which are really phonological units.<br />
um and uh ((uh uh)) and uh uh there&#8217;s a natural property that I- wrote about it in the 1950s,<br />
and it was taken for granted that if you just take a look at the-<br />
if you have a series of sounds and you look at the transitional probabilities<br />
uh at each point, what&#8217;s likely to come next,<br />
uh when you get to a word boundary the probabilities go way down, a<br />
you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s coming next, if it&#8217;s internal to a word, you can predict pretty well,<br />
so if you kind of trace transitional probabilities you ought to get something like word boundaries.<br />
((actually it&#8217;s)) I wrote about it in 1955.<br />
And I assumed that that&#8217;s correct. Turns out to be false.<br />
Uh it was shown actually by Charles Yang, a former student here,<br />
((comput-)) a PhD in the computer science department, that uh<br />
if you apply that method, it- it basically gives syllables uh in a language like English.<br />
Uh on the other hand if you apply that message under a constraint,<br />
namely the constraint that a word has what&#8217;s called a prosodic peak,<br />
you know like a pitch stress peak which is true then you get much better results.<br />
Now there&#8217;s more recent work which is still in press<br />
uh by Shookla (?) Aslin and others which shows that you get still better results<br />
if you apply that uh together with what are called prosodic phrases<br />
uh and it turns out that the you know uh an expre- a sentence let&#8217;s say has<br />
units i- uh units of pitch and stress and so on which<br />
are uh connected related to the syntactic structure actually in ways which were studied uh<br />
maybe first seriously by another former student Lisa Selkirk, a colleague of Barbara&#8217;s,<br />
uh but uh when you connect- when you interact prosodic peaks with transitional probabilities<br />
then you get a pretty good identification of word boundaries.<br />
Uh well you know that&#8217;s the kind of work that I think makes sense, if you uh<br />
uh uh and there are more complex examples but uh<br />
it- it&#8217;s a simple of the kind of thing that can work<br />
On the other hand there&#8217;s a lot work which tries to do sophisticated statistical analysis,<br />
you know bayesian and so on and so forth,<br />
without any concern for the uh actual structure of language,<br />
as far as I&#8217;m aware uh that only achieves success in a very odd sense of success.<br />
There is a succ- notion of success which has developed in<br />
uh computational cognitive science in recent years<br />
which I think is novel in the history of science.<br />
It interprets success as uh approximating unanalyzed data.<br />
Uh so for example if your were say to study bee communication this way,<br />
instead of doing the complex experiments that bee scientists do, you know like<br />
uh having fly to an island to see if they leave an odor trail and this sort of thing,<br />
if you simply did extensive videotaping of bees swarming, OK,<br />
and you did you know a lot of statistical analysis of it,<br />
uh you would get a pretty good prediction for what bees are likely to do next time they swarm,<br />
actually you&#8217;d get a better prediction than bee scientists do,<br />
and they wouldn&#8217;t care because they&#8217;re not trying to do that.<br />
Uh but and you can make it a better and better approximation by more video tapes<br />
and more statistics and so on.<br />
Uh I mean actually you could do physics this way,<br />
uh instead of studying things like balls rolling down frictionless planes, which can&#8217;t happen in nature,<br />
uh if you uh uh took a ton of video tapes of what&#8217;s happening outside my office window, let&#8217;s say,<br />
you know, leaves flying and various things,<br />
and you did an extensive analysis of them,<br />
uh you would get some kind of prediction of what&#8217;s likely to happen next,<br />
certainly way better than anybody in the physics department could do.<br />
Well that&#8217;s a notion of success which is I think novel,<br />
I don&#8217;t know of anything like it in the history of science.<br />
Uh and in- in those terms you get some kind of successes, and if you look at the literature in the field,<br />
a lot of these papers are listed as successes.<br />
And when you look at them carefully,<br />
they&#8217;re successes in this particular sense,<br />
and not the sense that science has ever been interested in.<br />
But it does give you ways of approximating unanalyzed data,<br />
you know analysis of ((a)) corpus and so on and so forth.<br />
I don&#8217;t know of any other cases, frankly.<br />
Uh so there are successes where things are integrated with some of the properties of language, but I know of-<br />
((the sec-)) know of none in which they&#8217;re not.</p>
