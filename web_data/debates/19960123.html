		<h1>On Dissidence</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky debates with Stefan Kubiak</h2>
<h3><i><a href="http://ettc.uwb.edu.pl/strony/students/chomsky.html">E-mail correspondence</a></i>, January 23, 1996 &#8211; April 11, 1996</h3>
<p>. Tue, 23 Jan 1996</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Kubiak,</p>
<p>Apologies for the delay in getting back to you.  I&#8217;ve been<br />
lecturing in India for several weeks, and just found your<br />
message.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t recall the discussion with Ernest Skalski that<br />
was the basis for the article you read &#8212; which is not very<br />
surprising; there are several of these every week, and I lose<br />
track.  Interested to hear your reactions to it.</p>
<p>Your comment that Poles have been used to considering everything<br />
that comes from the West as &#8220;the best,&#8221; which as far as I know<br />
generalizes to the rest of Eastern Europe, raises a question that<br />
has puzzled and intrigued me for some time.  Poland, of course,<br />
was oppressed by Russian tyranny, as were the other countries and<br />
the people of Russia itself.  But only on rare occasions, such<br />
as the invasion of Hungary, did that oppression begin to approach<br />
what the US has done routinely to Latin America (to pick only one<br />
example) during the same period (and to Central America and the<br />
Caribbean, long before).  Take, say, the treatment of dissidents.</p>
<p>In Poland, Czechoslovakia, and elsewhere in Soviet domains they<br />
had a hard time.  But they didn&#8217;t expect anything like the fate<br />
of the leading Jesuit intellectuals who had their brains blown<br />
out by elite military forces armed, trained, and directed by the<br />
US &#8212; and many others like them.  One Polish priest was murdered<br />
by the Polish police.  During the 1980s, there were over a<br />
hundred religious martyrs murdered &#8212; often after brutal torture<br />
and rape &#8212; by US-run forces in Central America, including an<br />
Archbishop, four American nuns working with the poor, etc.  And<br />
hundreds of thousands of peasants, working people, and others<br />
were murdered, often with extreme brutality, during the same<br />
decade, while four countries were devastated to the extent that<br />
they may not recover.</p>
<p>But though Latin Americans suffered far more, their reactions<br />
where far less self-centered.  Central American Jesuits, for<br />
example, have been very critical of US power, but that has not<br />
led them to be uncritical of Soviet power.  On the contrary, they<br />
have been highly critical of Soviet tyranny and brutality, and<br />
have always expressed great compassion, sympathy, and support for<br />
dissidents in Eastern Europe whose oppression, while real, didn&#8217;t<br />
come close to what they were suffering.  Having worked with<br />
oppressed people through much of the world, and read a good deal<br />
of what they write, I know that pattern holds throughout the<br />
world, with one exception: East Europe.</p>
<p>Merely to give one example, take Vaclav Havel, who indeed<br />
suffered under Soviet oppression.  In November 1989, six leading<br />
Jesuit intellectuals were brutally murdered in El Salvador by<br />
elite forces fresh from their US training, the same ones who had<br />
murdered Archbishop Romero and had compiled a monstrous record<br />
of atrocities that has no remote counterpart in the Eastern European<br />
satellites.  A few weeks later, Havel came to the US and gave a<br />
talk at the US Congress, where he had nothing to say about the<br />
fate of his fellow-dissidents under US rule, which is surprising<br />
enough, but furthermore, went on to laud the US as &#8220;the defender<br />
of freedom&#8221; &#8212; an outrageous comment, in the light of the facts.<br />
It is exactly as if some Jesuit intellectual in Central America<br />
who had been oppressed were to have gone to Russia to laud Russia<br />
as &#8220;the defender of freedom&#8221; before the Supreme Soviet &#8212;<br />
something that would have been utterly unthinkable.</p>
<p>Havel is not an evil man.  Rather, he adopts a perspective that<br />
seems pervasive in Eastern Europe, and unique to it, at least in<br />
my experience: the sense that their own suffering has unique<br />
significance, and that everything about the superpower which, for<br />
completely cynical reasons, opposed their enemy is therefore &#8220;the<br />
best.&#8221; That is something I&#8217;ve never understood, though I think<br />
one can think of some reasons for it: East Europeans dissidents,<br />
for example, were unique in the world in that their plight was<br />
the focus of great attention by the world&#8217;s most powerful states<br />
and institutions, and by the intellectual classes in the wealthy<br />
countries.  To illustrate with the same example, just about every<br />
minor speech that Havel delivers is featured in Western<br />
intellectual journals and treated with great respect, and<br />
generally the writings and courageous actions of East European<br />
dissidents are very well known.  But the very thoughtful and<br />
eloquent writings of Central American Jesuits and other highly<br />
principled dissidents within the regions of Western power, and<br />
their far more courageous actions in the light of the punishment<br />
they faced, are completely unknown, as are even their names.</p>
<p>These facts are dramatically obvious, and a terrible indictment<br />
of Western intellectual culture and its moral corruption, since<br />
on the most elementary moral grounds the opposite should have<br />
been the case: for any human being, it is the crimes for which<br />
he shares responsibility that should be the primary focus of his<br />
attention, not those of others.  And it may be that this has had<br />
its effect on the sole dissident intellectuals in the world who<br />
had the support and sometimes protection of powerful forces.</p>
<p>In any event, the facts seem clear, and merit explanation &#8212; also<br />
some reflection, I should think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be delighted to hear from you, both to learn more about what<br />
is happening in Poland, and to try to answer any questions you<br />
might have.  In some cases, questions might relate to things I&#8217;ve<br />
written about, in which case I&#8217;ll be glad to send material, if<br />
you wish.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>27 Jan 96</p>
<p>Dear Professor,<br />
Thank you for your message of 23 January. I am very glad to<br />
receive such interesting load of your opinions.<br />
First of all, I would like to respond to your statement that<br />
you cannot understand the Eastern Europeans&#8217; attitude towards the<br />
US,since the latter conduct cynic policy in South and Central<br />
America. I think it is quite understandable. Havel or Walesa are<br />
not the saints. They are ordinary people who led their nations<br />
in extraordinary way toward freedom. There were two powers who<br />
supported them in their efforts: Vatican (morally), and the US<br />
(morally and materially as well). Do you expect that someone whom<br />
a thief saved the life, will criticize his saviour. What is more,<br />
we still need material help from America and other western<br />
countries. Of course, Havel could express the problem without<br />
offending his American hosts, but it is too complex psychological<br />
problem of our leaders to simply accuse them of bad will. I mean<br />
the politicians of small countries are do not feel to have any<br />
moral rights to criticise their benefactors.<br />
The next problem is that of differences between the situation<br />
in South America and in Eastern Europe. We all live in the mental<br />
world of stereotypes and it is impossible to free from them. Our<br />
picture of ourselves was shaped during a thousand years of history. The<br />
political systems changed but the geographical position of Poland<br />
did not. We were always between the Germans, who looked down on us,<br />
and wanted to subdue our country, and the Russian, who represented<br />
the barbarian Asiatic mentality, and who always made attempts to<br />
destroy our (Western by Roman Catholicism)culture. During the 19th<br />
century our nation had to find some ways to survive. The Russians and the<br />
Germans wanted to denationalize the Poles. Our idol was France<br />
at that time, regardless if she was a republic or Napoleonic empire.<br />
We needed the good stereotype. We still need it, so you can<br />
observe temporal love to America. To tell the truth, it is going to its<br />
hard times, because people are disappointed at their hopes for further<br />
material aid. They are disappointed to democracy (nobody is<br />
responsible for anything), and to market economy as well. They<br />
expressed their feelings electing an ex-communist Aleksander<br />
Kwasniewski the president.<br />
If you want to understand our attitude towards the West in the<br />
1980s, you should know something about the life in our countries<br />
under the communist rule. The communists never were brave enough to<br />
admit that they simply loved to have power. They wanted to be admired<br />
and loved by people. They represented false ideology, and many of<br />
them believed they acted for people&#8217;s good. The communist party was<br />
a mixture of cynic pragmatists, gangsters, fanatics and servilistic<br />
intellectuals. I remember we were educated to believe that the<br />
Soviet Union is the richest country in the world, people there and in<br />
other satellites, have the highest standard of life, and the economic<br />
difficulties were always &#8220;temporal&#8221;. The reality was different.<br />
One could buy literally nothing at the shop, save some products which<br />
quality was terrible. People had money, there were not any<br />
unemployment, but if one wanted to gain (yes, &#8220;gain&#8221;, not simply<br />
buy),  something good, one had to deal with the black market. It was<br />
very hard to get a passport, so when someone managed eventually to the<br />
West, he brought the news about the paradise on the earth.<br />
Moreover, we realised that the communists told lies. Of course, their<br />
propaganda promptly used the information about corruption, racism, and<br />
American policy in South America to show us the hell of the western life.<br />
We began simply to deny everything they told us on TV. We did not<br />
believe them in cases we knew the truth, so we got used not to<br />
believe them in any cases. Another stereotype, nothing else.<br />
What we know about South America is that there always were<br />
&#8220;pronunciamentos&#8221;. One junta was running another. People love to<br />
thing by stereotypes. We accustomed to think about Latino-Americans as<br />
about the people of no democratic traditions, and no national<br />
definition. Moreover, they live so far away. I realise such thinking is<br />
inhuman, but this is the world of stereotypes. The Jesuits are people of<br />
strong faith. You, dear Professor are a great scholar and philosopher.<br />
You both can afford thinking above the dirty practice, and you<br />
can have very positive influence on the politicians, but do not be<br />
surprise when they turn out to be ordinary, weak and sinful<br />
people, who are not clever enough to manage to connect their activity and<br />
morality. In South America cruel regimes kill people in the name<br />
of their own desire of power. The situation is rather clear,<br />
fighting them is fighting the Evil itself. The US do not help in this<br />
struggle, on the contrary, they often support the murderers. That is true,<br />
but I believe that thanks to you and other people who think in the<br />
same way, it will be possible to improve the situation. Nobody will<br />
shut your mouth. In the communist countries it would have been<br />
impossible, you would have been not only arrested but blamed of being a spy,<br />
racist, nazist or of whatever they liked to accuse you of. They<br />
did not have to kill too many people. We were afraid enough to be<br />
ruled without too much oppression. I belong to the last generation,<br />
whom the communists tried to &#8220;wash brains&#8221; and make to believe in<br />
socialism and the Great Brother. They failed, but they succeeded in one<br />
point. Many of us still need a Great Brother, but not the old one. It<br />
is very difficult to live safely without a Great Brother.<br />
Excuse me, for bothering you so long. I have just wanted to<br />
express my opinion that the problem does not lies in politics, or<br />
economics, but in psychology. I wonder what you think about it. To tell the<br />
truth we do not know our motivation in most of cases, especially when<br />
we have to act quickly. The psychologists are still not able to<br />
explain it satisfactorily. I think the future will belong to them.<br />
I do not want to take your precious time any longer. Please<br />
if possible share your views with me. I would like to ask you some<br />
questions concerning the languages relativity, because as I wrote<br />
I had not been able to read any of your books. I would like to<br />
write about it next time.<br />
I stay<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Stefan Kubiak</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thu, 01 Feb 1996</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Kubiak,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t what to harp on the matter, but I really would urge that<br />
you rethink your interpretation of the attitude of East European<br />
intellectuals &#8212; or to be more accurate, East European<br />
dissidents: I am not concerned here with the great number who<br />
justified or supported the violence and repression of their own<br />
states, as most intellectuals have done throughout history, and<br />
as is the norm in the West with only a rare fringe of exceptions,<br />
contrary to much self-serving pretence &#8212; facts easily<br />
demonstrated, in fact documented in thousands of pages of<br />
material, if you are interested.</p>
<p>No one expects dissidents to be &#8220;saints,&#8221; to borrow your word.<br />
But what does require reflection and explanation is the radical<br />
difference between East European dissidents and their<br />
counterparts everywhere else in the world, something that is<br />
dramatically obvious to anyone who has been involved in human<br />
rights issues worldwide, as I have for many years.  I never wrote<br />
about this during the period of Soviet rule (and have scarcely<br />
done so since), because it would be improper to criticize people<br />
who suffer oppression no matter how badly they behave.  But the<br />
unique character of East European dissidents cannot be dismissed<br />
merely by noting that they are not saints.</p>
<p>Closer to the explanation is your observation that they were<br />
supported by the US and the Vatican, unlike dissidents elsewhere,<br />
who were supported by no one with any power or influence.  But<br />
that is a great understatement: they were given massive support<br />
and attention by the entire Western world, quite unprecedented<br />
support, vastly greater than the support given to people within<br />
Western domains who were suffering far worse oppression and were<br />
defending freedom and justice with far greater courage.  The<br />
disparity is so extraordinary that the very word &#8220;dissident&#8221; in<br />
Western languages refers to East Europeans; no one, except those<br />
few who have extricated themselves from the Western propaganda<br />
system, even uses the word &#8220;dissident&#8221; for people like the<br />
Central American Jesuit intellectuals who were assassinated in<br />
November 1989 by elite forces armed and trained by the US.  And<br />
while every word of East European dissidents is widely<br />
publicized, hailed, and treasured, try to find even a reference<br />
to the very important and courageous writings of Fr. Ellacuria<br />
and his associates, or other Central American dissidents who had<br />
to flee from slaughter or were simply tortured and killed by<br />
US-run forces.  For example, Fr. Cesar Jerez, the Jesuit<br />
provincial for Central America, who had to flee his native<br />
Guatemala when the US-run mass murderers threatened to kill all<br />
the Jesuits, going to El Salvador where he was the closest<br />
associate of Archbishop Romero, fleeing to Nicaragua after the<br />
Archbishop was murdered by the same US-run terrorist forces.  One<br />
of the reasons why Nicaragua was so hated in the US and by its<br />
Western allies is that it became a refuge for people fleeing from<br />
US terror, much as Paris had become a refuge for people fleeing<br />
from Hitler and Stalin in the 1930s.  People who were far from<br />
being Communists or even particularly &#8220;left&#8221;: writers, priests,<br />
human rights activists, democratic political figures, and others.</p>
<p>They fled to Nicaragua because there was no other place in the<br />
region where they could be safe from US terror.  Try to find a<br />
word about this in the Western literature.  And I can go on and<br />
on.</p>
<p>The fact is that dissidents in the Soviet satellites (or in the<br />
USSR itself, post-Stalin) were uniquely privileged among<br />
dissident intellectuals around the world in several respects:<br />
first, they received overwhelmingly greater attention and<br />
support; second, their suffering and oppression, though real and<br />
terrible, was not comparable to that of many of their<br />
counterparts elsewhere, a fact dramatically obvious in Latin<br />
America, where the US has ruled with a heavy hand.  That<br />
incidentally continues as we communicate right now.  Take<br />
Colombia, hailed here as a great democracy.  It has one<br />
independent political party.  Since it was formed about 10 years<br />
ago, 2500 of its leading activists have been murdered, most of<br />
them by the military and the paramilitary forces associated with<br />
them; that includes several presidential candidates, mayors, and<br />
others,  The murderers receive half of all US military aid and<br />
training in the hemisphere &#8212; on the pretext of a &#8220;drug war&#8221;<br />
which is taken seriously by absolutely no one with the slightest<br />
familiarity with the topic.  You can learn all about it in the<br />
regular extensive reports of the very same international human<br />
rights monitors (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) that<br />
recorded the repression in Eastern Europe, though there are the<br />
usual two differences: (1) no one pays attention in this case,<br />
while their reports about Eastern Europe aroused huge (and<br />
proper) outrage; (2) the repression in Eastern Europe did not<br />
begin to compare with what is faced daily in this highly-praised<br />
democracy.</p>
<p>I incidentally do not exempt myself from this dramatic disparity.</p>
<p>Thus I took personal initiatives in the case of Eastern European<br />
dissidents &#8212; several of whom were finally released to go the<br />
West in part as a result of these efforts &#8212; that far exceed<br />
anything I did for dissidents in US domains who were suffering<br />
much worse oppression.  I don&#8217;t say that with pride.  Rather, it<br />
simply reflects the great ease of opposing repression in Eastern<br />
Europe as compared with the enormous difficulty of even<br />
discussing much worse repression when its roots are in domestic<br />
power.  There is nothing historically unique about this &#8212; we can<br />
trace it back to classical Greece and the Bible.  But we do no<br />
one any service by denying very clear and plain facts.</p>
<p>Turning now to the reaction of East European dissidents, as<br />
compared with those elsewhere, the distinctions are equally<br />
dramatic.  Of course, these are generalizations; one will find<br />
exceptions.  But the differences are so extreme that the<br />
generalizations are valid to a very substantial &#8212; indeed<br />
overwhelming &#8212; degree.</p>
<p>Though this is minor, let me just mention some personal<br />
experience.  As noted, apart from joining in the usual regular<br />
protests and condemnations, and writing very harsh critiques of<br />
Bolshevik tyranny from my very first political writings to the<br />
present, I took far greater personal initiatives in the case of<br />
several East European dissidents (two Russian, one Czech) than<br />
I did in any case elsewhere.  Two of these people, incidentally,<br />
hold views that I regard as utterly atrocious on almost every<br />
topic, a fact I never mentioned of course.  They did make it to<br />
the West, where they were able to find good academic positions.<br />
Of course, I never had a note thanking me for any of these<br />
efforts, nor did I want or expect any such thanks.  But the<br />
situation elsewhere is dramatic.  Even for simply signing<br />
petitions, I have been personally thanked, repeatedly, by people<br />
suffering far worse oppression than these three (whose<br />
oppression, incidentally, amounted to discrimination against them<br />
in the academic world of a kind not unusual here).  The reason<br />
is not that they are bad people.  Rather, Eastern Europeans<br />
generally take it for granted that, naturally, everyone must<br />
dedicate all efforts and concern to them; no one else matters.<br />
That is a radical difference from other areas, including those<br />
where oppression is far worse.  Again, this is a generalization;<br />
there are exceptions.  But it is a generalization of more than<br />
a little validity.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take again Vaclav Havel, whom we have discussed.  When he<br />
came to the US in February 1990, no one expected him to deliver<br />
a ringing indictment of US terrorism and aggression in the US<br />
Congress; or even to mention US foreign policy; that was not my<br />
point, and I quite agree with you that he had no obligation<br />
to do anything of the sort.  In fact, it would have been<br />
acceptable morally for him not even to mention the fact that six<br />
of his counterparts in El Salvador had just had their brains<br />
blown out by troops armed and trained by the people he was<br />
addressing in Congress; not very admirable, but understandable.<br />
However, nothing required him to grovel before the murderers,<br />
praising the murderers of leading Central American dissidents as<br />
&#8220;the defenders of freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine that Fr. Ellacuria had gone to speak in Moscow and<br />
had discussed the terrible record of atrocities against Central<br />
American intellectuals &#8212; and hundreds of thousands of murdered<br />
peasants, union leaders, students, priests,&#8230; &#8212; going on to<br />
praise Russia as &#8220;the defender of freedom.&#8221; That would have been<br />
outrageous, despite the fact that he and his colleagues suffered<br />
far worse oppression and terror than anyone did in Czechoslovakia<br />
under the grim Soviet tyranny.  It would not only have been<br />
outrageous, but utterly unthinkable.  Like dissidents I know<br />
about and have been privileged to be associated with throughout<br />
the world, the Central American Jesuit intellectuals expressed<br />
great sympathy and compassion for their counterparts (actually,<br />
much more privileged counterparts) in Eastern Europe, and harshly<br />
condemned Soviet tyranny and oppression.  That was most<br />
definitely NOT reciprocated, as you can readily determine, even<br />
by those who did not sink to Havel&#8217;s level, praising the killers<br />
as &#8220;defenders of freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is true of Havel generalizes to people who do not have the<br />
excuse (which, in my view, is not much of an excuse) of<br />
representing a small country that had recently won its freedom.<br />
Namely, writers, academics, and many others.  Furthermore, it<br />
continues to be true long after they have won their freedom, and<br />
when they are in the West, facing no oppression, only vast<br />
acclaim.  One finds no counterpart to such behaviour on the part<br />
of intellectuals elsewhere in the world, with of course some<br />
exceptions: namely, the most loyal and craven Stalinists, who did<br />
behave in that manner.</p>
<p>These matters, I think, require reflection.</p>
<p>Your historical remarks are interesting, but I do not think that<br />
they are pertinent.  Latin American intellectuals have a history<br />
of hundreds of years of oppression, first in the colonial period,<br />
more recently mostly by the US.  The same is true of Africa,<br />
which suffered far more under European rule than Eastern Europe<br />
did &#8212; with the exception of Hitler and Stalin, who did compare<br />
with standard European behaviour, for example, the behaviour of<br />
King Leopold of Belgium, who murdered 10 million people in 20<br />
years in his Congo possessions while greatly enriching himself<br />
and Belgium, a feat that is impressive even by 20th century<br />
standards (and that has virtually disappeared from history, since<br />
the murder was carried out by the wrong hands).  And the same is<br />
surely true of the native American population of the US, who were<br />
reduced from perhaps 8-10 million to 200,000 by 1900.  But<br />
nevertheless, they do not rush to Moscow to praise &#8220;the defenders<br />
of freedom&#8221; or write other shameful nonsense about the marvels<br />
that the Soviet tyrants brought to the world within their reach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if we were to accept what you say about Poland<br />
and Czechoslavakia, it plainly does not hold of Russia itself.<br />
But the Russian dissidents are exactly the same.  Again, I never<br />
said a word about this at the time, for the reasons already<br />
mentioned, and haven&#8217;t since.  But simply have a look at what<br />
Russian dissidents (Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, etc.) were saying<br />
about the West and those who were suffering its terror and<br />
violence.  Not very pretty, and quite unlike the compassionate<br />
and honourable behaviour of people suffering far worse oppression<br />
within US and other western domains.  There were a few<br />
exceptions, like Grigorenko, but they were rare indeed.</p>
<p>I know about life under Leninism-Stalinism very well, and also<br />
know that educated Russians and East Europeans knew that the<br />
ridiculous lies promulgated by the leadership were an utter<br />
absurdity.  It is perfectly understandable that they should have<br />
denied anything that they heard on Soviet TV, though not what<br />
they heard over BBC and other foreign radio, to which a large<br />
majority of the population was listening by the 1970s, according<br />
to government-funded studies at Russian Research centres in the<br />
US.  I met enough Eastern Europeans (including Russians) over the<br />
years to know first-hand that they had a reasonable awareness of<br />
what was happening in the world.  And the awe and love of US<br />
power, particularly on the part of the apparatchiks, was<br />
something of a joke.  I can give you some examples if you like,<br />
from international meetings, where the Communist representatives<br />
trying to manipulate everything behind the scenes were working<br />
feverishly to tone down criticisms of their friends in Washington<br />
(particularly Nixon, who they greatly admired) that were proposed<br />
by groups of women from conservative American churches.  It was<br />
quite comical to watch, and pretty standard.</p>
<p>East Europeans certainly had more than enough information to be<br />
aware, if they chose, that in South America it wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;one<br />
junta running another,&#8221; with &#8220;no democratic tradition.&#8221; They had<br />
more than enough information to know about the massive US role<br />
in undermining democracy, instituting terror and atrocities, causing<br />
massive starvation and disease, in regions rich in resources and<br />
potential, the source of much of Europe&#8217;s wealth.  These were,<br />
after all, educated people, with plenty of resources available,<br />
even under Soviet tyranny.  If they chose to prefer self-serving<br />
stereotypes, that simply reinforces my point.  Elsewhere,<br />
independent minds did not, even under far worse oppression.</p>
<p>You are quite right that here in the US I am far more free than<br />
dissidents in the USSR.  But that is not the comparison I am<br />
making.  Rather, I am comparing the dissidents in the Soviet<br />
domains to those in US domains.  That difference is dramatic, and<br />
requires an explanation.</p>
<p>The far greater freedom in the West that you mention is important<br />
with regard to a different topic than the one we have been<br />
discussing.  That freedom, which is very real, confers far<br />
greater responsibility on Western intellectuals.  Therefore,<br />
their moral depravity is vastly worse than anything that you and<br />
I are now discussing.  As amply documented, Western intellectuals<br />
are immersed in the kind of state worship and denial of<br />
atrocities and repression that compares to some of the worst<br />
Stalinist commissars, and that is morally far more disgusting,<br />
since at least the latter could plead fear, while Westerners<br />
cannot.  But that is a different &#8212; and very important &#8212; matter.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the dramatic differences between Eastern<br />
European intellectuals and others suffering violence and<br />
oppression, I think you make a good point in attributing it in<br />
part to the effects of Soviet tyranny, and its inculcation of<br />
faith in power.  It may be that this shameful and disastrous<br />
system of tyranny also succeeded in undermining the intellectual<br />
integrity and independence even of its dissidents.  But I suspect<br />
that the major reason for the difference is the one I mentioned<br />
earlier: dissidents in the USSR and East Europe were unique in<br />
that they received enormous respect and support from outside (for<br />
cynical reasons, for the most part, as we can see by comparing<br />
how the same people reacted to atrocities for which they and<br />
their governments were responsible).  And this vast and<br />
unprecedented support and attention probably helped contribute<br />
to their sense that somehow their status was unique.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, the phenomenon is real, and I think merits<br />
reflection.  I don&#8217;t expect Western intellectuals to undertake<br />
this task.  If they did, they would have to expose their own<br />
depravity &#8212; that is, the fact that while professing great<br />
anguish over the fate of East European dissidents, they did not<br />
lift a finger to stop the far worse oppression of dissidents<br />
within US domains as they could have very easily done.  Or even<br />
to refer to it: again, compare the familiarity of Western<br />
intellectuals with the writings of East European dissidents, on<br />
the one hand, and Central American Jesuits, on the other; or any<br />
other reasonable comparison you want to make.  And the last thing<br />
that intellectuals are going to do is to expose themselves.  For<br />
that conclusion, history provides more than enough evidence, to<br />
our shame.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be happy to turn to questions of language and relativity, if<br />
you like.  Frankly, although I think the matters I&#8217;ve been<br />
mentioning are of supreme importance, I do not expect them to be<br />
understood or discussed by Western intellectuals, who are much<br />
too subordinated to power in general, and far too lacking in<br />
intellectual independence, to undertake such inquiry.  As to<br />
whether Eastern Europeans will some day have the intellectual<br />
courage to face these matters honestly, I have no idea, nor do<br />
I expect to write about it and discuss it.  My tasks are primarily<br />
where my responsibility lies: at home.  That is a moral truism<br />
if anything is.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Professor,<br />
Thank you for your answer to some of my doubts. Now I think I has<br />
understood some of your points. Nevertheless, I would like to<br />
precise the subject we are talking about. Your criticism is<br />
directed towards the Eastern European dissidents, whom you consider equal<br />
to intellectuals. Certainly, many of them are not intellectuals.<br />
In Poland, for instance, our chief dissident, Lech Walesa, who<br />
in 1991 became a president, has never claimed to be an intellectual.<br />
He is a simple worker with a great talent of a leader, and<br />
political instinct. He is not an educated man so people voted for a<br />
communist Aleksander Kwasniewski, who can express his thoughts in nice<br />
pseudo-intellectual words. Polish intellectuals (if they can be so<br />
called) are a small group, mostly in one of our parties:the Union of<br />
Freedom, and because of their typical for intellectuals hesitation, this<br />
party becomes less and less popular. As far as I understand your point<br />
of view, you would see intellectuals, or so-called dissidents, as<br />
persons who express their opinions from the position of God the Father,<br />
from the position of universal morality. Furthermore, they should<br />
teach the mankind about this morality. In general, I can agree with<br />
you. People all over the world need someone who will take a role of<br />
the ancient prophets. On the other hand, when one of those<br />
intellectuals becomes a politician, unfortunately he must often resign from the<br />
role of a heaven-sent teacher, responsible for all the world and its<br />
inhabitants. First of all, he is responsible for his own nation,<br />
because he was democratically elected by the people of his<br />
country. Peoples opinion in this case cannot be disdained. I&#8217;ll give you<br />
an example. When Tadeusz Mazowiecki (the first non-communist prime<br />
minister in Poland)after his prime ministerial office, became a<br />
representative of the UN in Bosnia, my father (a worker) said:<br />
&#8220;What is he going there for? We have enough our own problems.&#8221;<br />
My father&#8217;s opinion was not unique among the people. They cannot<br />
understand that we should be active in international affairs.<br />
The politicians have to consider such opinions. Otherwise, they<br />
could speak to nobody.<br />
You said that Havel&#8217;s speech in the US Congress, was as if<br />
Central American Jesuits had come to communist Moscow and praised the<br />
Russians for being &#8220;defenders of freedom&#8221;. I must say that this<br />
comparison entirely does not suit to the reality. First, Havel,<br />
being a politician rather than an intellectual dissident, wanted to<br />
build democracy in his country, so he turned to the USA as to the<br />
democratic power which really helped him and other Eastern-European<br />
politicians to overthrow the communism. It is quite understandable. And now<br />
imagine the situation when Jesuits turn for help to the power<br />
which had never helped any priests, in whose political doctrine there<br />
is fighting not only the Church but religion in general. Catholic<br />
priests knew very well that they have nothing to look for in Moscow, as<br />
well as Havel knew that there was much to look for in Washington.<br />
We both understand that democratic countries rarely were<br />
&#8220;exporters&#8221; of democracy. Ancient Athens or revolutionary France<br />
were condemned by their allies, because they acted in the name of<br />
their own citizens&#8217; interest. The only lesson the politicians can derive<br />
from those examples is to convince the superpowers that it is their<br />
good business to support democracy, because counting on their good<br />
will or sense of morality will probably fail.<br />
To be understood better I would like to explain what I mean<br />
speaking about &#8220;democratic tradition&#8221;. To me, a country with such<br />
a tradition has in its history rather long period when it was ruled<br />
democratically, or with some elements which led to democracy<br />
(parliament for example.) If you write about two hundred years<br />
of fights for freedom, it does not indicate that the South Americans<br />
can manage with democracy. Lech Walesa in Poland was a genius as<br />
a union leader, a man of political struggle. As a president of<br />
the republic he seemed not to know what to do and how to behave in<br />
particular situations. He could not respect the situation, that<br />
his own friends had different opinions. Thanks God, when he failed<br />
the election, he did not make a revolution. Fortunately, he<br />
understands the rules of democracy. I cannot imagine such situation in South<br />
America or in Africa. There if someone recognize himself to be<br />
a &#8220;saviour of the nation&#8221; will never give up his position to<br />
someone who is from the entirely opposite political &#8220;gang&#8221;. We have got<br />
examples of some South American &#8220;dissidents&#8221; who had searched<br />
help in Moscow. I mean Fidel Castro. Of course, Battista was really<br />
an American tool for ruling Cuba. But compare life in Havana at that<br />
time and now. What is the alternative for South America? Everybody<br />
will answer: democracy. But it is difficult to trust people, whose<br />
mentality has not grown to democracy. One may arrest all the bosses of the<br />
Mafia in Sicily, but what is the use of it, if there will appear<br />
a young boy, stronger and cleverer than his friends, who will<br />
require &#8220;respect&#8221; from them? This way of thinking has been being made for<br />
hundreds of years. Two hundred years of fighting for freedom<br />
means nothing in this context. By the way, to us, Europeans, two<br />
hundred years is too short time to talk about any tradition.<br />
Gustave le Bon in his &#8220;Psychology of the Crowd&#8221; wrote that<br />
nations could change their forms of government but they would always<br />
return to the system they had been used to. He wrote it at the end of the<br />
19th century, but in many cases it turned out to be true. For the<br />
Poles, Russia was always the country which wanted to destroy us as a<br />
nation. During the period of partitions of Poland, they simply wanted us<br />
to speak Russian, to confess the Orthodoxy, to be Russians<br />
altogether. After the revolution, Russia changed the political system, but<br />
was still an empire with strong will to subdue her neighbours.<br />
Stalin&#8217;s idol was not Marx, Engels or even Lenin, but Ivan the Terrible.<br />
His descendants were less cruel, but they were still tzars. For<br />
the Poles, Russia is a danger. After the World War II, the West left<br />
us to the disposition of the Soviets. I must admit that socialist<br />
ideas were quite popular among Polish workers, but first of all, people<br />
considered this sort of socialism as another face of Russian<br />
occupation. Imperial thinking in Russia can be observed even<br />
today. Russia has totally NO democratic tradition, and I am afraid,<br />
their present democrats are as &#8220;imperial&#8221; as Bolshevics or tsarist<br />
nobles. Let&#8217;s take Solzhenitsyn. When asked about his opinion on the<br />
Chechnya massacres, he answered that people required to much from him,<br />
when they wanted him to express his point in every case. From his<br />
earlier speeches it is clear that the great intellectual is an imperial<br />
Russian nationalist.<br />
Yesterday I wrote a fragment of an interesting book by Tina<br />
Rosenberg,&#8221;The Haunted Land:Facing Europe&#8217;s Ghosts after<br />
Communism&#8221;, New York 1995, Random House. I think she understands<br />
problems of Eastern Europe very well. She is a journalist. Previously, she<br />
worked in South America and had written &#8220;Cain&#8217;s Children&#8221;. I would like<br />
to read those books, and I will when they are available in Poland.<br />
You&#8217;ll have no trouble to get them and read. I think Rosenberg<br />
is more objective than I am. From the fragment I read I can hope it<br />
is a very good piece of knowledge of Europe. She underlines a very<br />
important item, that in Eastern Europe the communist system was<br />
murderous, and after the death of Stalin, even people involved<br />
in the machinery of the regime, could recognize themselves to be<br />
honest. In South America there are governments of murderers.<br />
Dear Professor, I do not want us to vie with each other in<br />
atrocities in communism and South American dictatorships. I agree<br />
with you when you condemn the government of you country for its policy<br />
in South America. We praise your country because the US helped us,<br />
regardless their reasons. Thanks God, Poland was &#8220;on the US&#8217;s<br />
way&#8221; to overcoming their communist competitors. During the whole 19th<br />
century nobody helped Poland in her fight for independence. The<br />
only politician who did anything with my country was Napoleon<br />
Bonaparte. Many contemporary politicians and intellectuals realized that he<br />
just needed Polish boys to his army. He established the Duchy of<br />
Warsaw (not Poland), a little country entirely controlled by the French,<br />
but the official language was Polish, and it was enough to believe<br />
in him as in our saviour. In the World War I, the western countries saw<br />
an interest in establishing independent Poland. Jozef Pilsudski, who<br />
had created some Polish troops beside the Austro-Hungarian army,<br />
was by some politicians considered a traitor. (Austria and<br />
Germany were partners of Russia in partition of Poland.) In 1916 he<br />
refused to take an oath on the faith to the German kaiser, and was<br />
arrested by his allies. Thanks to that fact he could be recognized by France,<br />
Britain and the US, as a leader of independent Poland. We respect<br />
the memory of Pilsudski, because he eventually created our<br />
independence. The West needed a country between themselves and Bolshevik<br />
Russia. France needed an ally behind Germany. It is understandable, that<br />
they thought about their business, but the effect was independent<br />
Poland. During the World War II the West left us alone twice.<br />
They did not help us in 1939, and in 1945. As to 1939, they could stop<br />
Hitler effectively, but they did not. In 1945 I can understand<br />
them, they could not risk another war for Poland. The basic manual of<br />
politicians is not the Bible, but &#8220;Il Principe&#8221; by Machiavelli.<br />
In my opinion, the only method you, and your supporters may<br />
undertake to stop atrocities in South America, is to convince<br />
your politicians that it is much better business for the US to support<br />
democracy and freedom in this region than to maintain murderous<br />
juntas. If you only protest from the position of an intellectual,<br />
no one will pay attention to your voice. Unfortunately, no<br />
country is &#8220;on the way&#8221; to manage his own business in South America, to<br />
help its countries to establish democracy. There is no political<br />
power to do anything against the US. But I believe that the US<br />
government is convincible sufficiently, so that someone wise and<br />
experienced would persuade it the moral policy.</p>
<p>Dear Professor, I am sorry for bothering you so long. Please<br />
forgive me my insolence in this moment. I would like to know how<br />
many languages you know, and how you had learned them. Your name<br />
is famous among any philologists, but I would like to tell my<br />
students about you. I teach in secondary school history and English. I<br />
believe that one of the most important points of my job should be<br />
motivation of my students. In my opinion it will very good when they can<br />
hear about such a famous person as you are. They do not like school,<br />
and foreign languages frighten them most. I would like to encourage<br />
them by positive examples. You are the best.<br />
Thank you once again, dear Professor, I am waiting for your<br />
interesting remarks. I always share of them with my friends. They<br />
usually cause a &#8220;brainstorm&#8221;.<br />
I stay<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
Stefan Kubiak</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wed, 14 Feb 1996</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Kubiak,</p>
<p>Apologies for the delay.  I&#8217;m utterly swamped with mail and<br />
e-mail these days, and can&#8217;t keep up with the deluge.  Most long<br />
letters I just cannot try to answer.  But I have a special<br />
interest in this correspondence, and therefore will try to keep<br />
up with it as best I can.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to follow your suggestion and try to focus the subject<br />
of discussion more precisely.  But that may require some work.<br />
I think it is becoming clearer as we proceed that we are beginning<br />
from very different assumptions.  As a result, we have not yet<br />
been able to identify even the areas of disagreement, let alone<br />
to try to resolve them, though I suspect that if we can begin to<br />
communicate, we may find that we are not that far apart on<br />
fundamental issues or even matters of fact.  At least, we should<br />
be able to identify the areas of disagreement, I hope also to<br />
reduce or maybe eliminate them.</p>
<p>The simplest way to proceed, I think, is by my taking up the<br />
points you raise in your letter, in order.</p>
<p>Walesa.  You&#8217;ve mentioned him several times, but I haven&#8217;t.  The<br />
reason is that I didn&#8217;t want to bring in an extraneous issue.<br />
Now that you raise it yet again, I&#8217;ll comment.</p>
<p>I realize that in Europe, and even more so in Eastern Europe, a<br />
rather sharp distinction is made between &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; and<br />
&#8220;simple workers&#8221; (I borrow your terms).  As you put it, Walesa<br />
is not an &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; just a &#8220;simple worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>That distinction means much less in the US, and to me, it means<br />
essentially nothing: in fact, I think it is a remnant of deeply<br />
authoritarian attitudes that ought to be overcome.  One of the<br />
things I very much like about the United States is that<br />
&#8220;intellectuals&#8221; aren&#8217;t taken very seriously, unlike Europe.  That<br />
is one aspect of the general levelling of class differences in<br />
the domain of personal life (not in other domains, of course)<br />
that I find a very attractive feature of American culture and<br />
society.  In Europe and elsewhere, I&#8217;m constantly annoyed by the<br />
deference that is shown to privileged people, intellectuals in<br />
particular.  And I&#8217;m often appalled by the way they act, and by<br />
their expectations as to how they should be treated.  Here, I&#8217;ve<br />
rarely felt so embarrassed as when accompanying Eastern European<br />
visitors to dinner &#8212; professors (often nice people),<br />
apparatchiks, specialists on America who I presume came from the<br />
KGB or something like it (most of them somewhere to the right of<br />
the Republican party and fawning with adoration about the US and<br />
its policies, particularly their most disgusting features), and<br />
the like.  The way they treated waiters, for example, simply made<br />
one&#8217;s flesh crawl.  The same is true of Europe rather generally,<br />
though it rarely reaches this level (unless one moves to the more<br />
comic extremes of the British aristocracy, and then there&#8217;s a bit<br />
of self parody involved, so it isn&#8217;t quite so bad).  One aspect<br />
of all of this is the distinction between &#8220;intellectual&#8221; and<br />
&#8220;simple worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make the matter more concrete, yesterday I spent much of the<br />
day at a seminar at Harvard with a group of &#8220;simple workers&#8221;:<br />
trade unionists who have a 10-week session there.  It&#8217;s a regular<br />
event.  I&#8217;ve been doing it for years, often for lengthy follow-up<br />
sessions and private meetings.  Most the participants are from<br />
the US, but there are others from around the world, sometimes<br />
(not this year) Eastern Europe.  I don&#8217;t know much about Walesa,<br />
but don&#8217;t see why he should be any different.</p>
<p>At yesterday&#8217;s meeting, I opened with the same kind of talk I&#8217;ll<br />
be giving tomorrow evening at Brandeis University under the<br />
auspices of the graduate department of political science.  Or<br />
just about anywhere else.  There are some differences.  People<br />
with different lives and backgrounds tend to have somewhat<br />
different immediate concerns, for many reasons; and more educated<br />
people tend to be more deeply indoctrinated, particularly those<br />
who would be called &#8220;intellectuals,&#8221; and hence are typically<br />
engaged in some form of doctrinal management, as part of what<br />
might be called &#8220;a commissar class.&#8221; But there aren&#8217;t any broad<br />
differences, at least in my experience since childhood, outside<br />
of some faculty clubs in elite universities and literary salons<br />
in New York, and the like.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t mention Walesa because I didn&#8217;t want to go into this.<br />
Whether he deserves the title &#8220;intellectual&#8221; more or less than<br />
Havel is an individual matter, having nothing to do with what the<br />
two of them do.  I&#8217;ve certainly known &#8220;simple workers&#8221; who merit<br />
the term much more than distinguished writers whom I&#8217;ve known.<br />
Many of the people called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; do mostly clerical<br />
work, or parrot what they&#8217;ve been told.  Many of the people<br />
called &#8220;workers&#8221; are independent-minded, thoughtful, and very<br />
knowledgeable.  True, &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; tend to be far more<br />
privileged, so they are more likely to use big words and literary<br />
references.  But that&#8217;s not relevant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Poles react to Walesa and Kwasniewski exactly as you<br />
say; it&#8217;s what I would have expected, knowing nothing about this<br />
specific matter.  For the same reason, when I was asked by<br />
European intellectuals to sign joint statements with Jean-Paul<br />
Sartre, it was front-page news in Paris and ignored here, quite<br />
right.  The reason is that people here are more sane (in my<br />
opinion) than Paris intellectuals.  The first time I was arrested<br />
here, in civil disobedience against the Vietnam war, there were<br />
front-page headlines in Paris reading &#8220;Chomsky en danger.&#8221; Here,<br />
there was no mention anywhere, even in the local paper.  That&#8217;s<br />
precisely the right reaction: I was arrested, so were 1000 other<br />
people whose names no one had ever heard of.  What&#8217;s the<br />
difference?  Answer, none.</p>
<p>It is, in my opinion, a defect of societies that have yet to shed<br />
feudalistic characteristics that the distinctions are taken<br />
seriously.  Here, fortunately, they are taken much less<br />
seriously, and I don&#8217;t make them at all, except when I have to<br />
adapt to conventional usage to be understood.</p>
<p>When I use the term &#8220;dissident intellectual,&#8221; I mean a person who<br />
thinks independently (hence an intellectual) and rejects the<br />
doctrines favoured by the powerful (hence a dissident).  Maybe<br />
the person is a steel worker, maybe he writes plays or teaches French<br />
literature at Harvard.  That&#8217;s not to the point.  I omitted<br />
mention of Walesa simply so as to bypass these matters, which I<br />
know are understood very differently in Europe, even more so in<br />
Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>You interpret me as seeing &#8220;intellectuals, or so-called<br />
dissidents, as persons who express their opinions from the<br />
position of God the Father, from the position of universal<br />
morality,&#8221; people who should &#8220;teach mankind about this morality.&#8221;<br />
You add that you &#8220;agree with me.&#8221; But you do not.  I reject the<br />
view you are attributing to me &#8212; totally, completely, as<br />
adamantly as I can.  I do recognize the view that you think I am<br />
expressing.  But to my mind, it falls in the domain of games<br />
played by &#8220;respectable intellectuals&#8221; for careerist or other<br />
reasons, usually in the service of external power.  I have<br />
nothing to do with it.  I condemn it and regard it as shameful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know any more about &#8220;universal morality&#8221; than the trade<br />
unionists I was talking to yesterday, nor did it ever occur to<br />
them that I did or that I thought I did.  And neither they nor<br />
I regard it as our task (or anyone else&#8217;s) to &#8220;teach mankind about<br />
this morality.&#8221; I hope you don&#8217;t mind my being frank, but I&#8217;m<br />
sure they would react to the words of yours that I just quoted<br />
about as I do, though anyone familiar with European intellectual<br />
culture, and in particular the form it has taken in Eastern<br />
Europe, understands where the thoughts are coming from.</p>
<p>You say that &#8220;people all over the world need someone who will<br />
take the role of the ancient prophets.&#8221; Two comments.  First, the<br />
factual assumptions that underlie it are dramatically false, and<br />
false in ways that I would like to suggest merit some<br />
reflection.  Second, I disagree strongly with the intended<br />
thought.</p>
<p>You are expressing a standard Leninist line, echoed in virtually<br />
the same words by the mainstream of 20th century Western<br />
intellectuals &#8212; something I&#8217;ve documented at length, if you are<br />
interested &#8212; and pretty much the position of the Grand<br />
Inquisitor.  But before getting to that, let me recall the facts<br />
about the &#8220;ancient prophets,&#8221; which I&#8217;m sure you know as well as<br />
I.</p>
<p>Those called &#8220;prophets&#8221; in the Bible are more or less what are<br />
called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; these days.  They presented geopolitical<br />
analyses and other commentary on public affairs, and also<br />
expressed their views about moral issues.  Since what we are<br />
reading is a rendition of societies of several millennia ago,<br />
they all claimed to be speaking in the name of one or another god.<br />
The prophet-intellectuals came in the two familiar varieties:<br />
roughly commissars and dissidents.  As always, the commissars<br />
were greatly honoured and privileged; they are the ones that<br />
people listened to, the Bible tells us.  Centuries later, they<br />
were called &#8220;false prophets.&#8221; The dissidents are those who<br />
centuries later were called &#8220;prophets&#8221;; they are the ones to whom<br />
you are referring as the &#8220;ancient prophets.&#8221; They were reviled,<br />
imprisoned, driven into the desert; virtually no one listened to<br />
them.  Furthermore, the man who was in my opinion the greatest<br />
of the prophets stressed that he was NOT an intellectual (not a<br />
&#8220;prophet or the son of a prophet,&#8221; in the terminology of the<br />
day), but rather a simple farmer.  It&#8217;s worth pondering the<br />
actual words of the persecuted and reviled dissidents, and<br />
there is also much to learn about the history that the Biblical<br />
account records.  It&#8217;s been relived over and over again through<br />
the ages, most recently in the USSR and its satellites and in<br />
Western elite culture, in surprisingly similar ways.</p>
<p>The facts about the &#8220;ancient prophets&#8221; matter illustrate exactly<br />
my points.  The version of history you presuppose, which is<br />
precisely the opposite of what the Bible clearly and<br />
unambiguously records, reflects the assumptions of the Grand<br />
Inquisitor (Lenin, Wilsonian liberals, etc.): that people need<br />
commissars to lead them, perhaps speaking for one or another god<br />
(the Bible is polytheistic), perhaps for the Central Committee,<br />
perhaps for the corporate boardroom, perhaps pure careerists,<br />
perhaps hoping to gain state power by exploiting popular struggle<br />
(Leninism, naturally a doctrine of great appeal to &#8220;radical<br />
intellectuals&#8221;).</p>
<p>Precisely what people do NOT need is a &#8220;prophet&#8221; in the sense in<br />
which you are misusing the term.  They can think very well for<br />
themselves, thank you, and there is no one smart enough to teach<br />
them the principles of &#8220;universal morality&#8221;; certainly<br />
&#8220;intellectuals&#8221; have nothing to preach about these topics, no<br />
more than the simple farmer who was not a prophet or the son of<br />
a prophet.</p>
<p>It seems that we are in different universes here, I&#8217;m afraid,<br />
which may be one reason why we are not communicating too well.<br />
I completely reject the assumptions that you are taking for granted<br />
throughout, and that you identify as the area of our agreement.</p>
<p>I hope at least it is clear that we disagree precisely where you<br />
thought we were agreeing, and maybe in fundamental ways.  Just<br />
on grounds of logic, all of this has to be cleared up before we can<br />
even hope to communicate about these important matters.</p>
<p>The idea that &#8220;politicians&#8221; or &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; are concerned with<br />
international affairs while workers are not may well be true of<br />
your personal experience; I&#8217;ll take your word on that.  My<br />
experience is completely different, and the reading and study<br />
that I have done suggests to me that my experience is far from<br />
unique or even unusual.</p>
<p>My father came from a tiny village in the Ukraine and on arriving<br />
here worked in a sweatshop.  My mother&#8217;s background was similar.<br />
Both were very much interested in international affairs; my<br />
father&#8217;s interest goes back to the Shtetl, where he taught<br />
himself Russian in part for that reason (a terrible heresy in the<br />
society in which he grew up, run by totalitarian Rabbis with the<br />
power of the Czar behind them).  My relatives here were mostly<br />
working class.  Many had little formal education.  The one who<br />
influenced me more than anyone in my life never got beyond fourth<br />
grade.  They were first-generation immigrants &#8212; seamstresses,<br />
labourers, etc. &#8212; mostly unemployed when I was growing up during<br />
the depression.  Some managed to make it through school and had<br />
become school teachers.  Some were involved in petty commerce.<br />
I&#8217;ve yet to find a milieu that reaches anything like their level<br />
of intellectual ferment, excitement, and engagement: Stekel&#8217;s<br />
most recent disagreement with Freud, what was really happening<br />
in the Spanish Civil War, the latest performance of the Budapest<br />
String quartet, contemporary avant-garde literature, etc.</p>
<p>Another person who I met in my early 20s and whose work I found<br />
pretty impressive was a tool and die maker who had little formal<br />
education: Paul Mattick, one of the most important writers of the<br />
group that was around Rosa Luxemburg, Anton Pannekoek, Karl<br />
Korsch, and other left Marxists (radically anti-Leninist, of<br />
course).  I didn&#8217;t agree with a lot of what Mattick said,<br />
particularly about the importance of Marx (about which I&#8217;ve<br />
always been sceptical).  But as an intellectual he surely ranked<br />
well above what I was reading in intellectual journals (including<br />
the left) or hearing among the distinguished Cambridge<br />
intelligentsia.  I suspect he and his circle are unknown in<br />
Poland.  If so, that illustrate the stultifying effect of the<br />
Leninist and Western propaganda systems.</p>
<p>You say that politicians are interested in international affairs,<br />
not working people.  That&#8217;s news to me.  I&#8217;ve known many people<br />
in Congress and government &#8212; and in distinguished faculties of<br />
international affairs.  Their interest and knowledge is often<br />
extremely narrow, and they are often remarkably ignorant:<br />
McNamara and Kissinger are two dramatic examples, which I have discussed<br />
in print.  Many of them focus like a laser on some minute area<br />
of professional work, understanding nothing a millimetre to right<br />
or left.  I&#8217;ve documented a lot of this, and can add a great deal<br />
more from experience.  I&#8217;ve found far higher levels of just plain<br />
factual knowledge, let alone understanding, in churches in Kansas<br />
or working class areas in Detroit than in many a faculty club,<br />
and certainly more than in congressional offices, where one<br />
expects &#8212; and finds &#8212; very little knowledge and less<br />
understanding, at least from the man sitting behind the desk and<br />
producing the oratory.  Off in the background there are often<br />
young people (legislative assistants) who do the actual thinking<br />
and writing, and they are sometimes quite good.  The same is true<br />
incidentally in the most distinguished news rooms, as one quickly<br />
discovers on the briefest exposure.</p>
<p>You turn next to Havel.  You point out that his coming to speak<br />
before Congress is not quite analogous to the (hypothetical) case<br />
of Fr. Ellacuria coming to speak at the Supreme Soviet, because<br />
Havel was a politician seeking support from the US and Central<br />
American Jesuits were not in a comparable position.  You are<br />
correct.  No analogy is precise, or it wouldn&#8217;t be an identity,<br />
not an analogy.  But the analogy I drew was quite accurate for<br />
the point I was making, in my opinion.</p>
<p>But we need not tarry on that.  Let&#8217;s pick an analogy that<br />
overcomes your objection.  Suppose that the Stalinist system<br />
still survived and that Aristide or Mandela were to go to Moscow<br />
to praise the bloody murderers there as &#8220;defenders of freedom,&#8221;<br />
in the hope of getting some support &#8212; support they desperately<br />
need.  To make the analogy closer, suppose Aristide or Mandela<br />
were to do this a few weeks after security forces armed and<br />
trained by the Kremlin had blown out the brains of six leading<br />
Polish intellectuals &#8212; a pea on the mountain of the atrocities<br />
that they were trained, armed, and guided to carry out by the<br />
Kremlin.  How would you react to this (hypothetical) performance<br />
on the part of Aristide or Mandela?  Why don&#8217;t you react exactly<br />
the same way to the (quite actual) performance by Havel?  It<br />
seems to me a fair question.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll mention again something I&#8217;ve probably already told you.<br />
I&#8217;ve never discussed Havel&#8217;s behaviour in print.  More exactly,<br />
I did mention his address to Congress, but without bringing up the<br />
shocking and shameful context, specifically, the events he knew<br />
had just taken place in El Salvador.  Rather, I mentioned his<br />
remarks only in discussion of the reaction of enlightened<br />
left-liberal opinion to them, a reaction that falls far below<br />
Havel in the level of its depravity, for reasons I presume are<br />
obvious.  Thus in the hypothetical analogue, the most slavish<br />
commissars in Russia would doubtless have praised Aristide or<br />
Mandela effusively, in the same terms used by left-liberal<br />
opinion in the US in worshipping Havel for having lauded the<br />
&#8220;defenders of freedom&#8221; who had once again murdered the leading<br />
dissidents in their client states.  I don&#8217;t know how to put it<br />
any more clearly.  If this does not appal you, we really do live<br />
in different moral universes.</p>
<p>You go on to make some remarks about &#8220;democratic tradition&#8221; and<br />
about South America &#8220;managing with democracy&#8221; which, I&#8217;m afraid,<br />
I simply do not comprehend.  I therefore cannot comment.  What<br />
you say about Parliaments and democracy is particularly<br />
surprising, and I doubt that you mean what your letter said.  In<br />
any event, surely parliaments are no indication of democracy,<br />
contrary to what you assert.  Russia had a parliament, even a<br />
beautiful democratic Constitution.  Similarly, after Woodrow<br />
Wilson&#8217;s Marines invaded Haiti and violently disbanded its<br />
Parliament because it refused to accept a US-written Constitution<br />
that allowed US investors to buy up Haiti&#8217;s land, the idealistic<br />
Wilson insisted that the Marines run elections to install a new<br />
Parliament.  So they did: under the guns of the Marines, 5% of<br />
the population voted for a new Parliament, which in turn voted<br />
for Wilson&#8217;s new Constitution by 99.98%.  So Haiti was a<br />
democracy with a Parliament and a wonderful Constitution, by the<br />
criteria you are suggesting (which are, incidentally, accepted<br />
as valid in this case by George Kennan, leading Harvard specialists<br />
in international affairs, etc.).</p>
<p>In any event, what you say in this paragraph I certainly do not<br />
accept if I read it literally, and I don&#8217;t know how to read it<br />
in any other way.</p>
<p>You say that Fidel Castro is a &#8220;dissident&#8221; who searched for help<br />
in Moscow.  That is indeed the way the matter is described in<br />
US-Soviet propaganda &#8212; which were quite similar, incidentally,<br />
not only in this case.  The facts are a bit different.</p>
<p>Castro was more or less a traditional Latin American caudillo but<br />
of the populist type (not entirely unlike Torrijos, for example).</p>
<p>He had no ties to Russia, and was anti-Communist.  But he was<br />
independent, and the US would never tolerate that in Cuba for<br />
reasons that go back to the 1820s, when they were articulated<br />
with great clarity by Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and<br />
others; I&#8217;ll suggest sources if the facts aren&#8217;t familiar.<br />
Within a few months after his taking power in Jan. 1959, planes<br />
based in Florida were bombing Cuba.  In March 1960, the<br />
Eisenhower administration made the formal decision (in secret)<br />
to overthrow the government of Cuba.  At that time, its own<br />
evidence, we now know, was that Castro was an independent<br />
authoritarian who had the overwhelming support of the population,<br />
that he was anti-Communist, and that there were no Russians in<br />
sight.  The US then invaded Cuba, and when the invasion failed,<br />
launched the world&#8217;s most intense campaign of international<br />
terrorism, with horrendous effects, as well as a tight embargo,<br />
which Cuba could no more survive than Latvia could have survived<br />
an embargo and huge terrorist attack by the USSR.  No one was<br />
willing to defy the monster, and at that point Castro turned to<br />
Moscow for support, which it lent him for perfectly cynical<br />
reasons.  How significant this tie to Moscow was to US power we<br />
can easily determine: first, note what happened before the ties<br />
were established; second, note what happened after they were<br />
broken.  QED.</p>
<p>To describe this as a &#8220;dissident&#8221; turning to Moscow for support<br />
is a little thin, to put it mildly.  And note that it has not the<br />
slightest resemblance to Havel&#8217;s behaviour in 1990.</p>
<p>You say that life in Cuba is worse today than it was under<br />
Batista.  That&#8217;s a remarkable statement.  Try to find any<br />
reputable source on Cuba, however extreme its mimicry of the<br />
Stalinist commissars, that would accept that judgment.  The basic<br />
facts are readily available and not controversial, and quite<br />
different from the vulgar propaganda that you seem to be relying<br />
on.</p>
<p>Despite the extraordinary attack by the US, which has escalated<br />
since the collapse of the USSR, quality of life standards in Cuba<br />
(health, life expectancy, literacy, infant mortality, etc.) are<br />
barely below the level of the US and Canada, and far higher than<br />
the rest of the hemisphere (Costa Rica, for instructive reasons<br />
that I&#8217;ve written about, is an exception).  That is even more<br />
remarkable in the light of the fact that none of the other<br />
countries had been subjected to 35 years of brutal attack by the<br />
master of the hemisphere.  Of course, if we pay attention only<br />
to the top few percent in wealth, then your conclusions are correct.</p>
<p>The rich sectors in Haiti, Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala, etc., are<br />
far better off than people are in Cuba.  If we deign to look at<br />
roughly 80-90% of the population, the conclusions are radically<br />
different.  The large majority of people in these countries could<br />
scarcely dream of the conditions of Cuba.  Furthermore, that is<br />
not only well known, but it is one major reason for the fanatic<br />
hatred of Cuba on the part of US elites, who have always regarded<br />
Cuba as a &#8220;virus&#8221; that might &#8220;infect others&#8221; by the dread<br />
demonstration effect, to borrow Henry Kissinger&#8217;s words when he<br />
was justifying the overthrow of Chilean democracy by a gang of<br />
neo-Nazi murderers and torturers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised, and suggest that you have a look at the<br />
facts, which are not in dispute.</p>
<p>Your scepticism about Latin American democracy is equally<br />
curious.  Chile had a long and vibrant democratic tradition until<br />
it was overthrown by a US-backed military coup, because the US<br />
will tolerate democracy in its sphere only if the results come<br />
out &#8220;the right way.&#8221; That&#8217;s incidentally fairly explicit; I&#8217;ve<br />
given plenty of documentation, if you are interested.  Guatemala<br />
had ten years of quite successful democracy, until it was<br />
overthrown by a US-run military coup &#8212; in this case, with really<br />
horrendous consequences, which persist.  Costa Rica has long been<br />
as democratic as any European country.  I can proceed.  Again,<br />
I&#8217;d suggest that you look at the facts, not just at propaganda,<br />
and certainly not Gustave le Bon.</p>
<p>On Solzhenitsyn, I would again suggest that you look at the<br />
facts.  True, he was willing to fight courageously for himself<br />
and his friends, abandoning his Stalinist commitments when he too<br />
became a victim.  And he did some work that is interesting and<br />
important.  But his hatred of freedom and democracy, and his<br />
shameful moral views, were so outlandish that in the US &#8212; where<br />
he had been venerated because of his attacks on the official<br />
enemy &#8212; he was bitterly condemned and then utterly disregarded<br />
as an embarrassment.  I doubt that anyone here even heard what<br />
he said about Chechnya, and few would have cared.</p>
<p>You asked about Tina Rosenberg.  She is indeed a good journalist,<br />
and her work on Latin America is in general useful and honest.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure what question you are asking about her, so cannot<br />
respond.</p>
<p>You say you do not want us to compete &#8220;in atrocities in communism<br />
and South American dictatorships.&#8221; If you think that is what we<br />
are doing, you have misread the earlier correspondence.  I&#8217;d<br />
suggest that you have another look, and I think that will be<br />
clear.</p>
<p>You say that you praise the US because the US helped you.  That&#8217;s<br />
your privilege.  I doubt that Mandela would say that he praises<br />
the USSR because it helped him (as sometimes it did, for cynical<br />
reasons).  For reasons as cynical as those that led the West to<br />
support you, the USSR supported the democratically-elected<br />
government of Nicaragua (that term will probably surprise you,<br />
but if so, you can overcome the surprise by looking at the facts,<br />
specifically, the conclusions of strongly anti-Sandinista Latin<br />
American and European democrats and others who observed the 1984<br />
election).  But my good friend Father Cesar Jerez would never<br />
praise Russia for helping him (as it did) in the way you praise<br />
the US for helping you.</p>
<p>To explain, let me give you a little background, suppressed by<br />
the commissar culture, and not to be permitted into official<br />
history.  But true, and instructive about the reality that<br />
Eastern Europeans typically do not want to look at.</p>
<p>Fr. Jerez was a Guatemalan, an important figure in the Catholic<br />
Church: he was Jesuit Provincial for Central America.  He fled<br />
Guatemala when the US-run state terrorists threatened to murder<br />
all the Jesuits.  He went to El Salvador, where he was the<br />
right-hand man of Archbishop Romero, and the actual author of an<br />
important letter which is suppressed here in the mainstream, but<br />
is well known to the kinds of people I was talking about before,<br />
say in churches in Kansas: not &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; but people who<br />
care about truth and justice.  It was a letter sent by the<br />
Archbishop to President Carter, pleading with him to stop sending<br />
military aid to the junta, because it would be used to slaughter<br />
people fighting for their elementary human rights.  Carter of<br />
course sent the aid, and the Vatican immediately called Fr. Jerez<br />
to Rome, having been instantly informed by the US that it must<br />
put an end to the doings of this &#8220;troublesome priest.&#8221; He went<br />
to Rome, saw the head of the Jesuit order, and had an audience with<br />
the Pope, who, despite his shameful role in support of terror and<br />
oppression in Latin America, at least in this case did not<br />
specifically order him to stop his cooperation with the<br />
Archbishop.  Romero was murdered a few days later by US-supported<br />
state terrorists, and Jerez fled to Nicaragua, which in those<br />
years was the refuge for human rights activists, writers,<br />
priests, democratic political figures, etc.; it was rather like<br />
Paris in the &#8217;30s, then a place of refuge for anti-fascists and<br />
anti-Stalinists.  Fr. Jerez did not support the Sandinistas, but<br />
he agreed with the World Court (and Latin American opinion apart<br />
from the superrich and ultra-jingoist right) that Washington&#8217;s<br />
&#8220;unlawful use of force&#8221; (as the World Court termed it) &#8212; i.e.,<br />
aggression &#8212; must be instantly terminated (it was escalated at<br />
once by congressional liberals).  Fr. Jerez was surely glad that<br />
the cynical thugs in the Kremlin were helping Nicaragua survive<br />
the US attack.  But he would NEVER, NEVER have dreamt of uttering<br />
the words you use.</p>
<p>Again, I would suggest that these matters merit some reflection.</p>
<p>Your advice to me reflects a failure to understand how democracy<br />
works.  A democracy is not ruled by &#8220;politicians,&#8221; and one does<br />
not implore them to do nice things.  What one does is engage<br />
oneself with people &#8212; in churches in Kansas, in working class<br />
areas of Detroit, everywhere &#8212; who want to educate themselves<br />
and others, and to organize to compel the politicians to do nice<br />
things, or replace them by others who will do so.  That&#8217;s<br />
elementary, or should be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if this sounds harsh.  I don&#8217;t mean it to be.  I think<br />
there are reasons why decent honourable people in Eastern Europe<br />
think and act in ways that are so radically different from their<br />
counterparts elsewhere, including those I have mentioned and many<br />
others like them.  The main reason, I think, is that dissidents<br />
in Eastern Europe were uniquely privileged.  I am not referring<br />
to the fact &#8212; and fact it is &#8212; that in the post-Stalin period<br />
their travail, though shameful and terrible, was nothing like<br />
what was endured by their counterparts in Central America,<br />
Africa, and many other places.  Rather, I am referring to the<br />
fact that they were the only dissidents anywhere who had the<br />
overwhelming support of the most powerful forces in the world,<br />
and of their articulate intellectuals as well as their general<br />
populations.  For the governments and articulate intellectuals,<br />
this was pure cynicism for the most part, as easily demonstrated.</p>
<p>But the support was real, overwhelming, and without any remote<br />
analogue.  One result is that Eastern Europeans developed a very<br />
distorted picture of themselves and of the rest of the world.<br />
I&#8217;m sure that is what accounts for the difference between Havel<br />
and his counterparts in US domains.  And as you know far better<br />
than I, I&#8217;m taking Havel merely as an illustration; the<br />
phenomenon is far more general, and exceptions are remarkably<br />
few.</p>
<p>Turning to the matter of languages, I know English, of course,<br />
and happen to know Hebrew because I grew up with it, was<br />
intensely interested in the language and culture and everything<br />
associated with them, and sustained the interest.  But that has<br />
virtually nothing to do with my work in linguistics (though it<br />
did, 50 years ago).  Other languages I know only from reading;<br />
a casual acquaintance.  Thus I can read French, which I never<br />
studied, but can&#8217;t use the language.  I did happen to study<br />
Arabic for several years, 50 years ago, when I toyed with going<br />
to live in what was then Palestine, later Israel.  But that was<br />
independent of any concern for linguistics.</p>
<p>The basic answer to your question is that I don&#8217;t know any<br />
languages, apart from my native language.  I know a fair amount<br />
about languages, but that&#8217;s from reading work done on those<br />
languages.  My knowledge of languages is more or less like the<br />
kind of knowledge that many biologists have about plants and<br />
animals.  There are plenty of fine biologists, Nobel prize<br />
winners for example, who might not be able to tell a lion from<br />
a tiger.</p>
<p>As in the other areas of our discussion, the analogies shouldn&#8217;t<br />
be pressed too far, but the basic point holds.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with you about motivating students.  That&#8217;s<br />
about 99% of teaching, in my opinion (based on experience from<br />
teaching children as I worked my way through college, to teaching<br />
advanced graduate courses today).</p>
<p>Much enjoy thinking through what you have to say, and I hope we<br />
can clear away misunderstandings and reach what I expect is a<br />
common core of basic beliefs and attitudes.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky</p>

<p>Dear Professor,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your last message. It was a big material<br />
to think about. Thank you for that.</p>
<p>First of all I must apologize for my language mistakes. I has<br />
recently checked my messages to you and I realized that I had made a lot<br />
of them. Please, forgive me. I use any while between my classes at<br />
the college to come to our computer lab and to write a few words to<br />
you, but unfortunately I usually have to hurry to another classes<br />
before I check my text. That is the same reason that I do not look for the<br />
best phrases to express my thoughts, and try to write as much as<br />
possible at once. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the painful but very helpful lesson. I really had<br />
to rethink some of my points. And in this moment it occurred to me<br />
that I can afford changing my mind or look at some problems from<br />
different positions, when many of politicians cannot. It is horrible that<br />
societies are so understanding. Everyone should learn everyday,<br />
and there is no shame to make the mistake, it is corrected. In the<br />
world of democracy when someone becomes an expert after the hard<br />
studies of his/her office, it is time for him to go, the society do not want<br />
him any more.</p>
<p>I would like to know what for you democracy is. You wrote that<br />
parliamentarism does not indicate democracy at all. Of course you<br />
are right, but what should democracy be? We realize that indirect<br />
democracy like that in ancient Athens is impossible nowadays. On<br />
the other hand many politicians repeat that nobody has ever invented<br />
anything better than democracy. To many of them it becomes a<br />
status quo, and nothing can be done to improve the situation. In Eastern<br />
Europe after the first years of democracy the euphoria for the<br />
system has weakened. People in 80s were fighting not only for democracy<br />
but for personal material prosperity as well. We have got democracy,<br />
but we are far from being rich. This is the main reason why people<br />
are disappointed with democracy, so they voted for the communist.<br />
Democracy is a system in which everybody is quarrelling with<br />
everybody, nobody is responsible for anything, and political elites enrich<br />
themselves at the cost of &#8220;a simple worker&#8221; (it&#8217;s not mine, I&#8217;ve<br />
heard this expression several times from the workers.) There is<br />
still a stereotype of the working-class and its opposition or enemy.<br />
Why in Eastern Europe we make such distinction between workers<br />
and educated people. To tell the truth in our daily life we did not.<br />
But in discussions there appears the problem of this distinction from<br />
time to time. I shall try to explain it to you.<br />
I do not want to begin with the Polish tradition of 10% of the<br />
nobles in 17th century.(To compare in France there were 2%)The stupid<br />
custom of recognising oneself something better than the others is very<br />
old. But let&#8217;s take the history of the 20th century. You mentioned<br />
your parents. I must say that the situation is entirely different from<br />
that before the Second World War. My mother&#8217;s grandfather was an<br />
illiterate. He was a peasant in the very small village. Everyday<br />
he wanted his sons (who attended to school) to read him a newspaper.<br />
When he was over sixty he taught himself to read and was able to<br />
get to his beloved news himself. His son (my grandfather) was a<br />
peasant too. Apart from his usual work, he was active in the Young<br />
Farmers&#8217;  Organization. They conducted a library, organized self-educating<br />
circles etc. And now a Polish village during the period of<br />
&#8220;worker- peasant alliance&#8221;,which was the &#8220;leading force&#8221; in society: The<br />
only entertainment was drinking vodka. I could observe that situation<br />
myself. Nobody was interested in raising his qualifications.<br />
Young people were not able to achieve something attractive but on the<br />
other hand they weren&#8217;t afraid of hunger of poverty.<br />
My father&#8217;s father:he was a worker in Lodz. He was a fan of<br />
history so my aunt could inherit quite a big collection of historic books.<br />
He wanted her to educate. Before the war it was almost impossible<br />
for the worker&#8217;s daughter, the fee was too high. There was a<br />
&#8220;worker&#8217;s university&#8221; in Lodz led by the socialists (not communists, because<br />
they were interested in overthrowing the state and in becoming a part<br />
of the USSR). Unfortunately the war broke out. After the war my aunt<br />
could study history as she dreamt of. All her life she felt to<br />
be a communist, and I do not find it strange. My father did not study<br />
too much, and became a forester, and then a worker in the power<br />
station. Let&#8217;s have a look at Lodz or any other Polish city today. I have<br />
many friends from my primary school, with whom I keep contact. Most<br />
of them are workers. You could hardly find a book in their houses.<br />
A newspaper is bought once a week, mainly for TV programme for the<br />
next week. Sometimes I can hear confession that they had always been<br />
dreaming of not having to learn any longer. They really are not<br />
mentally handicapped, on the contrary, some of them were very<br />
intelligent. The communism killed the survival instinct, and<br />
ambition too. Today, when I am a teacher(I am a historian, as my aunt<br />
was), I can observe my students, and it is plain to me that their future<br />
life depends not so much on their knowledge but their ambition<br />
supported by hard work. Unfortunately, most of my students do not believe<br />
in possibilities of success, and do not even try to do something<br />
with their future. They do not know anything about both home and<br />
foreign affairs although they think to do so. They repeat the opinions<br />
of their frustrated parents who themselves do not understand much.<br />
Statistic researches have shown recently, that only 20% of adults<br />
in the Polish countryside understand TV news. My friends are still<br />
my friends and neighbours, but there are some subjects I do not<br />
discuss with them, because the communism convinced them that a worker<br />
must be right, and simultaneously discouraged them from education. The<br />
communism provided free education for everybody, but most of the<br />
people did not want to take the opportunity, and I do not think<br />
that we should still flatter the present working class.</p>
<p>You criticized me for attributing you with ideas which you do not<br />
share with me. I mean that statement about the ancient prophets.<br />
I thought about the prophets of the Bible of course. I did not<br />
want to write that the world needs the teachers in the leninist<br />
meaning of the word. Of course we do not need ideologists to &#8220;know better&#8221;.<br />
But when you, or other person (I try not to use the word<br />
&#8220;intellectual&#8221;)<br />
criticise a politician for doing something wrong, you simply take<br />
a part of a biblical prophet. I did not mean those official<br />
prophets gathered around the Temple and connected with priests and<br />
monarchy. The greatest of them acted against them. They performed in the<br />
name of God (or gods if you prefer that), but it was simply the same<br />
sense of morality, that we all have. I believe so. I think that we all<br />
have an innate sense of morality or a sort of &#8220;moral logic&#8221;, but<br />
upbringing and wrong education may destroy it. So there must<br />
always be people who clearly remind everybody of the simplest rules of<br />
common life, and I think you are one of them when you say to the Eastern<br />
European politicians:&#8221;It is not all right, gentlemen. There is<br />
much to be improved all over the world, and you shouldn&#8217;t call a tyrant<br />
&#8220;defensor of democracy&#8221;&#8221;. I think we both have the same moral<br />
universe, but I always try to understand the motives of the<br />
others. I can understand politicians, but it does not indicate that I<br />
praise them or share their opinions.</p>
<p>Dear Professor, there were many other items in your letter, I<br />
would like to refer to. Unfortunately, my next classes are coming, and<br />
I have to finish. I must admit with a shame that I am far from<br />
being expert on South America affairs, and thank you for the lesson.<br />
I would like to ask you about your educational way. What schools<br />
did you attend, when did you begin to be interested in linguistics,<br />
and what was your way to your theory like. If possible write<br />
something about your work now please. I wonder what kind of meeting with<br />
the workers was that you mentioned. I am looking forward to your next<br />
message.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Kubiak,</p>
<p>Afraid I&#8217;m in a pretty big rush, but don&#8217;t want to let your<br />
message disappear into the huge pit of to-be-answered.  Quick<br />
comments.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t aware of any language mistakes or other problems.  I&#8217;m<br />
sure there are plenty in my messages, also always in a rush, like<br />
yours, no chance even to proofread or edit.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s democracy?  A long story, too long to go into here.  There<br />
are many dimensions: it&#8217;s not a yes-or-no affair.  In general,<br />
a society is democratic to the extent that the population can enter<br />
in a meaningful way into the design and management of public<br />
affairs.  In totalitarian states of the fascist-Communist type<br />
(not much difference, in my opinion), the options for such<br />
participation vary from near zero to a lot more, depending on<br />
details of social organization (which vary).  In terror states<br />
of the type the US has run for a long time in its region, there is<br />
a formal right of participation, as long as you don&#8217;t mind being<br />
murdered.  So El Salvador in 1980 had complete freedom of press;<br />
it&#8217;s only that of the two journals that were not entirely<br />
supportive of the US-run regime, one was blown up by the security<br />
forces and the editor driven out of the country under death<br />
threat, and the other closed when the editor and journalists were<br />
found hacked to death in a ditch.  This was not considered<br />
interference with freedom of the press here, and indeed was<br />
scarcely reported.  Similarly, Colombia is described by Bill<br />
Clinton and the press and even scholarship as a vibrant<br />
democracy, which even has had an independent political party for<br />
a few years; true, 2500 of its activists have been murdered,<br />
mainly by the security forces and their paramilitary associates,<br />
including presidential candidates, mayors, etc. &#8212; a small<br />
fraction of the human toll.  But that doesn&#8217;t interfere with<br />
democracy, so there is no complaint when the US directs half its<br />
military aid in the hemisphere to the security forces, to<br />
preserve democracy.</p>
<p>In my view, there is virtually no democracy in such<br />
circumstances, even if there is a formal right to vote, and the<br />
same is true in societies in which most of the population is<br />
traumatized or impoverished or marginalized.  Take the US, with<br />
very stable democratic institutions.  Over 80% of the population<br />
feel that the democratic system doesn&#8217;t function for &#8220;the<br />
people&#8221;: the government serves &#8220;the few&#8221; and the &#8220;special<br />
interests.&#8221; Are they wrong?  Not really.</p>
<p>Suppose that decisions over investment, production, commerce,<br />
etc., are in the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies.  Is<br />
the system democratic?  According to accepted dogma today in the<br />
US, the answer is that it is.  According to mainstream American<br />
social thinkers like John Dewey, who devoted most of his work to<br />
problems of democracy, the answer is definitely no.  The<br />
independent working class press in the US last century also took<br />
that for granted, without ever having heard of radical<br />
intellectuals (luckily for them).  These would be truisms in free<br />
societies, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a lot about these topics, as have others.  There&#8217;s<br />
a fine book called &#8220;Democracy&#8221; by my colleagues and friends Joshua<br />
Cohen (well-known political philosopher) and Joel Rogers<br />
(professor of law and sociology), published by Penguin.  I think<br />
they have a lot to say, though it&#8217;s not quite what I would say,<br />
not surprisingly.</p>
<p>I was much interested to read your account of Polish life (about<br />
which I know much too little, I&#8217;m afraid).  Perhaps I wasn&#8217;t<br />
clear when I wrote about my own parents.  Remember that they were<br />
Jewish.  My father lived in a tiny village in the Ukraine, and<br />
the family was quite poor (I told you what happened when he got<br />
here); similarly, my mother&#8217;s family.  But they were not<br />
peasants.  They had peasants doing their dirty work for them.<br />
I doubt that you would have found a Jewish woman cleaning the house<br />
of a Ukrainian involved in petty commerce and the like; the<br />
contrary was common.  My grandfather lived here for about 50<br />
years, in a completely Jewish ghetto in Baltimore.  Never learned<br />
a word of English.  I often had the feeling he was still in the<br />
Ukraine, and was wondering why the peasants here were black.</p>
<p>On the prophets, I don&#8217;t think we are disagreeing, at least if<br />
I now understand you (sorry if I didn&#8217;t before).  The point that<br />
I think should be stressed is that the model of the prophets and<br />
false prophets has been repeated in one or another form<br />
throughout recorded history.  It tends to be forgotten now that<br />
the prophets were despised and punished, the false prophets<br />
revered and rewarded &#8212; and as I mentioned, one of the greatest<br />
of the prophets emphasized that he was not a prophet (i.e., an<br />
intellectual in our terms) but an ordinary working person.<br />
That&#8217;s something found through history too, right in this area<br />
from the early industrial revolution, in fact, and well into my<br />
childhood.  It&#8217;s taken a lot of effort to turn working people<br />
into creatures &#8220;as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a<br />
human being to be,&#8221; as Adam Smith put it (from memory, but<br />
something like that) in his sharp critique of division of labor<br />
and warning that the government must act to prevent it from<br />
working its mischief in any civilized society.</p>
<p>True, there are lots of differences among societies, but this is<br />
an important strain, now mostly obliterated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what meeting with workers I mentioned.  If it was<br />
in January, it was a meeting with younger trade union activists who<br />
come here for a 10-week seminar, at the Harvard business school.<br />
It is a program that was designed 60 years ago to tame and<br />
&#8220;civilize&#8221; the work force (socialization is a major commitment<br />
of the elite universities), but in the past few years the program<br />
has for various reasons become a really lively center of working<br />
class education and militancy.  I go there regularly, and it&#8217;s<br />
always fascinating.  Or maybe I was referring to something else;<br />
I don&#8217;t recall.  Sorry.</p>
<p>On my own background, it was very strange.  As a child, my<br />
interests were mostly political (a mixture of anti-Bolshevik<br />
mostly anarchist left and what was then called Zionism and is now<br />
called &#8220;anti-Zionism&#8221; &#8212; a long story in itself).  I might well<br />
have dropped out of college at about age 17, mainly out of<br />
boredom, when I happened to meet Zellig Harris through political<br />
connections of this type.  He was the leading linguist in the<br />
country, and a pretty remarkable person, who influenced a lot of<br />
young people, including me.  In ways too long to recount, I ended<br />
up back in college, doing graduate work in several scattered<br />
fields but with no undergraduate or real professional training;<br />
I still don&#8217;t have any.  Technically, I have a phd (from Harris at<br />
U. of Pennsylvania), but it was a sort of private affair &#8212; I was<br />
doing my own work, which no one even looked at, and which had<br />
essentially no home in the academic world, and was almost<br />
entirely unpublishable (the 1000-page book I was writing, mainly<br />
for myself and a few friends, was published in part 20 years<br />
later, mainly for historical interest).  I got to MIT because I<br />
was unemployable, having no credentials, and this is a<br />
science-based university, where they didn&#8217;t care.  I was hired<br />
in an electronics laboratory (I can hardly tell a radio from an<br />
electric toaster), on a project that I said I wouldn&#8217;t work on<br />
because I thought it was ridiculous (machine translation).<br />
Luckily for me, the director of the lab, a well-known<br />
scientist-engineer who was later Kennedy&#8217;s science adviser,<br />
thought the work I was doing looked intriguing, so I was hired<br />
anyway, and stayed, mainly because I like the atmosphere so much.</p>
<p>A few years later a colleague-friend and I were able to start a<br />
graduate linguistics program.  I also taught some of the earliest<br />
philosophy courses here, and was able to help get a graduate<br />
philosophy program started.  Meanwhile work developed in all<br />
sorts of directions.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very brief outline.  Don&#8217;t know if you want the (very<br />
big) gaps filled in, but could try sometime if you like.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>9 Mar 96</p>
<p>Dear Professor,</p>
<p>Thank you for your message of February 29. As usual, getting to<br />
know your opinions and learning more about you is very interesting and<br />
useful for my future work.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to share with you my impression on a<br />
play I have recently seen in our local theatre. It was written by Edward<br />
Redlinski, who had spent about six years in New York. The play<br />
is based on his book &#8220;Szczuropolacy&#8221;(&#8220;Rat-Poles&#8221;), and its title is<br />
&#8220;The miracle in Greenpoint&#8221;. The author expressed his total<br />
disappointment at America and Americans&#8217; way of life. I suspect<br />
he exaggerated much, because he chose some extreme examples of the<br />
Poles who tried to survive in the jungle of the New York Polish ghetto<br />
and simultaneously informed their families in Poland about their<br />
great successes. The play shows, in my opinion, another stereotype of<br />
America, this time the stereotype of Edward Redlinski: country<br />
where everything is evaluated by its price in dollars, people do not<br />
believe in anything but dollar and so on. Some of my friends were<br />
living in America for some years and most of them still consider<br />
the US as the most wonderful country in the world. Despite all those<br />
discrepancies between descriptions of America, there are some<br />
noticeable observations in the play. Redlinski states that a<br />
great many Poles are in deep love with America. That is partly true. I<br />
personally was fascinated by American freedom of the units and<br />
her democracy, in my opinion in those days, a perfect system. To tell<br />
the truth in a way I am still fascinated by the phenomenon of your<br />
country. I&#8217;ll return to this topic. Another very true Redlinski&#8217;s<br />
observation is that Poles are on the way to lose their identity<br />
by accepting American patterns of behaviour, business and customs.<br />
One of the heroes of his play says: &#8220;We&#8217;ve already got America in<br />
Poland but a little worse.&#8221; Yes, we&#8217;ve got MacDonald&#8217;s, Disney<br />
(Disney is rather all right if we compare his films with entirely stupid<br />
&#8220;Superman&#8221;,&#8221;Batman&#8221; or any others psychopathic &#8220;-men&#8221;), jeans etc.<br />
That is not so tragic, because those things were known in Poland<br />
even during the communists&#8217;rule. But why the most awful drunkard&#8217;s den<br />
is called now in English &#8220;Drink Bar&#8221;, why the smallest shop with<br />
candies is called in English &#8220;Shop&#8221; or &#8220;Store&#8221;? Of course we may count<br />
on foreign tourists, but if you come to such a &#8220;shop&#8221;, nobody will<br />
understand you, because they do not know English. The conclusion<br />
is that it is not America what came to Poland. It is the most<br />
horrible part of Greenpoint. Mentality of some groups of my countrymen<br />
changed tragically. Thinking with categories of profit wins more and more<br />
people. In Lodz for example people are as neurotic as Poles in<br />
Greenpoint. In Bialystok there is still more traditional approach<br />
to life &#8211; family, religion and patriotism in old fashion. But the<br />
invasion of pseudo-americanism is plainly seen even here.<br />
The tragedy of &#8220;The Miracle in Greenpoint&#8221; is in the fact that<br />
the only man who stands against the prostitution of teenage girl,<br />
whose &#8220;manager&#8221; is her own father, is a narrow-minded greedy catholic<br />
fanatic, who had dreamt that Madonna had promised him ten million<br />
dollars of the LOTTO award. It must be connected with the whole<br />
precess of Polish overthrowing communism in 1989.</p>
<p>When we wanted communism to collapse, the most of the nation<br />
acted unanimously against the Polish United Workers&#8217;Party. After the<br />
victory the anticommunist opposition divided itself into small parties.<br />
They become each other&#8217;s enemies, and they entirely disdained the<br />
post-communists, who stayed more or less(rather more) united. The<br />
latter won the parliamentarian election in 1993 and presidential<br />
election in 1995. What can be noticed is that during those six years of<br />
democracy people did not understand what &#8220;Solidarity&#8221; fought for. Lech<br />
Walesa as far as I remember was speaking about &#8220;the possibilities for<br />
industrious and ambitious people&#8221;, he did not promise everything<br />
for everybody, as the Left parties are used to doing in any country.<br />
The catholic fundamentalists hoped the country would be ruled by<br />
strict religious values.(By the way, those values are indeed<br />
universal, and most of the people would like to live according<br />
to them, but they could not agree with the role which the catholic<br />
politicians claimed to play, the role of the guards of morality.)<br />
The liberals wanted the free market economy, but simultaneously<br />
they began to believe in everything the western economists and<br />
businessmen would &#8220;teach&#8221; us. As a result, a lot of our production plants<br />
belong to the western capital, because our politicians promptly sold<br />
them as quickly as they could. I do not know if they took bribes, I want<br />
to believe that not. Today, the former &#8220;Solidarity&#8221; is divided<br />
between the numerous Right parties (tradition, religion and horribly Left<br />
economic program &#8211; &#8220;religious ideal communism&#8221;), Trade Union<br />
&#8220;Solidarity&#8221;, mostly friendly to the parties mentioned above, and<br />
Union of Liberty, a center party of liberals and democrats. The<br />
latter are not homogeneous, there are socialist and people of views<br />
similar to those of American Republicans. There is one Left party derived<br />
from &#8220;Solidarity&#8221;, small Union of Labour. And on the Left wing<br />
strong and dangerous post-communists, who promise working people much,<br />
have a program very similar to that of our liberals (free market), and<br />
who apparently want to keep power centralised, so they disturb in<br />
works on increasing self-government institutions. They cannot fulfil their<br />
promises to the workers, teachers etc, because our country is too<br />
poor, but what everyone can plainly observe the biggest<br />
&#8220;capitalists&#8221;, businessmen, entrepreneurs etc. are the prominent members of<br />
their party. What is more tragic, people can see that, but they prefer<br />
the communist capitalist to the groups of neurotic fanatics who<br />
constantly are in argue with each other. What I could observe,<br />
most of the people will express their love to democracy and freedom,<br />
but to tell the truth they would prefer to live like cows &#8211; to be<br />
milked from time to time, but at the same time to have someone to feed<br />
them. Lack of the sense of responsibility and American desire for<br />
success make them weak tools in hands of cynic politicians.</p>
<p>I personally believe that we have to start working on democracy<br />
at school, and I&#8217;ll do my best to reform Polish educational system,<br />
which provides students with a lot of useless knowledge, not<br />
giving them very necessary skills and sense of social cooperation.<br />
This is a problem which interests me much, and if you would like<br />
to know something about it I&#8217;ll describe that system.</p>
<p>Returning briefly to America. You know, whatever one says about<br />
America, it could be true. To someone America is a crib of modern<br />
democracy, to another she is a country of tough hard working<br />
people, to anybody else she is a country of murderers of the Indians and<br />
exterminators from Vietnam,to some people she is full of cunning<br />
businessmen, to the others she is a country of the best trade<br />
unions, to me she is a country of splendid universities, courageous<br />
journalists, and Noam Chomsky. There are million faces of<br />
America, so it is nothing strange that people love her, but accepting all her<br />
features, denying one&#8217;s own identity is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Dear Professor, I would like to know if you would be interested<br />
in visiting Poland. I talk to my friends and lecturers about our<br />
correspondence, and we would be very happy to receive you in our<br />
college. It is affiliated with the Bialystok Branch of the<br />
University of Warsaw. Our branch has ambition to become an independent<br />
university soon. It would be a great honour to us to have such<br />
aguest as you are. Please, write what you think about it.</p>
<p>I have got a lot of questions to you, but unfortunately I must<br />
leavethe computer lab for the class of British Phonetics.<br />
Waiting for the message from you, I stay</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Stefan Kubiak</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12 Mar 1996 10:29:01 EST</p>
<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>I wonder if you would mind, at this point, if I revert to the<br />
American habits that come naturally to me and drop formalities.</p>
<p>Your letter was most interesting.  I&#8217;m having it run off hard<br />
copy so I can think about it some more.  Quick reaction.</p>
<p>Like your friends, I actually consider the US to be &#8220;the most<br />
wonderful country in the world.&#8221; When I go anywhere else, I&#8217;m<br />
appalled by many things: the deep internalization of class<br />
differences, the lack of intellectual independence or respect for<br />
freedom of expression, and much else.  Take England, pretty much<br />
like the US.  I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time there, and simply cannot<br />
get used to the fact that since I&#8217;m a RESPECTED INTELLECTUAL with<br />
a big salary, I&#8217;m treated with deference and respect.  It&#8217;s not<br />
easy for me to talk on equal terms in England to the taxi driver<br />
or the TV cameraman or the waiter or the guy fixing the water<br />
pipes.  In the US, it&#8217;s taken for granted.  That&#8217;s a wonderful<br />
thing.  During the sixties, I was always amused when I co-signed<br />
some silly pronouncement with Jean Paul Sartre.  In France, it<br />
was a headline in Le Monde.  Here, it wouldn&#8217;t even be reported,<br />
because there is no interest in the fact that two intellectuals<br />
said something &#8212; an attitude I greatly admire.  The first time<br />
I was arrested here for civil disobedience, in a protest against<br />
the Vietnam war, there was a headline in the French press<br />
(&#8220;Chomsky en Danger&#8221;).  The Boston press didn&#8217;t mention it,<br />
correctly, because several hundred other people were arrested<br />
too, who merit attention no less than I do.  I can continue, but<br />
these are among the really fine things about this country, not<br />
appreciated elsewhere.</p>
<p>I should say that all of this is much less true of the privileged<br />
educated elites &#8212; the people in the Harvard Faculty Club, or at<br />
the New York literary soirees, or the editorial offices or<br />
corporate suites.  They are just as comical and ridiculous as<br />
their European counterparts.  But fortunately, most people here<br />
regard them as ridiculous &#8212; as they are &#8212; unlike Europe or most<br />
of the third world, where such people are taken quite seriously.</p>
<p>So Redlinski is right not only about many Poles, but even about<br />
some people whose parents fled from the Ukraine, and who remain,<br />
like their parents, &#8220;in deep love with America&#8221; &#8212; not the way<br />
its commissar class portrays it, but as it really is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s far from a &#8220;perfect system.&#8221; In fact, the socioeconomic<br />
system is a scandalous catastrophe.  But there are a lot of very<br />
good things here that I have yet to find in most other corners<br />
of the world.  Though I&#8217;ve found them in some places, I should add.<br />
For example, I was in India a few weeks ago, and was able to take<br />
off a day in the West Bengal countryside, the site of peasant<br />
struggles in the post-independence period, and horrifying<br />
repression during the Indira Gandhi years (the &#8217;70s).  The<br />
outcome has been some very impressive levels of self-government<br />
in rural villages, something unique in India, and hard to<br />
duplicate anywhere in the world.  The attitudes and behaviour of<br />
poor peasants towards authority and privilege was very heartening<br />
to see, as well as the overcoming of caste and tribal<br />
differences, the role of women, the enthusiastic engagement of<br />
people in running their own affairs.  The poverty is terrible by<br />
Western standards, but they have a lot to teach us.  Poles would<br />
do far better to look there for models, or to the slums of Haiti,<br />
or many other places I know of from personal experience.  And<br />
privileged Americans should be looking to such places too, if<br />
they were interested in learning what democracy and freedom are<br />
about.  Not too likely.</p>
<p>As for your observation that it is &#8220;the horrible part&#8221; of America<br />
that is being mimicked abroad, that&#8217;s entirely true.  But also<br />
understandable.  The people who are doing the selling are the<br />
worst and most depraved segment of American society, and the most<br />
privileged and powerful, not by coincidence.</p>
<p>On Polish liberals wanting &#8220;the free market economy&#8221; and<br />
believing &#8220;everything the western economists and businessmen<br />
would `teach&#8217; us.&#8221; It is true that professional economists,<br />
like other educated people, may well believe the &#8220;free market&#8221;<br />
drivel they produce.  But the business world has always known<br />
better.  Like all other developed countries, from England to the<br />
East Asian NICs, the US has never been willing to submit<br />
privileged sectors to market discipline.  That&#8217;s for the poor at<br />
home and the third world.  The business classes have always<br />
demanded, and obtained, protection and massive subsidy from a<br />
powerful nanny state.  That continues today, without change.  If<br />
Polish liberals prefer to believe the rhetoric rather than<br />
looking at the facts, that simply shows how little they have<br />
advanced from the days when many of them believed what they read<br />
in Pravda.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to hear more about your ideas on reforming<br />
Polish education.  An important task, everywhere.</p>
<p>As for visiting Poland, I&#8217;d like to very much.  I&#8217;ve never been<br />
in Eastern Europe.  Applied for a visa once, in Czechoslovakia<br />
(1968), but was turned down, not surprisingly.  Visiting<br />
totalitarian societies has never had any appeal for me.  Now, of<br />
course, it&#8217;s very different, and I&#8217;d like to work it out.<br />
Problem is that demands are awfully heavy, and I&#8217;m scheduled<br />
years in advance, almost without a break.  But it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d<br />
very much like to do, before too long.  I&#8217;ve had many<br />
invitations, but always from professionals who want me to talk<br />
about my more technical work.  I like to do that, but not only<br />
that.  I never go anywhere unless I can spend time on problems<br />
of human concern, not just those I find intellectually fascinating.</p>

<p>Dear Noam,<br />
Thank you very much for your last message. It is a great honour<br />
for me to come to the less formal way of communicating. In Poland<br />
relationship between scholars and students are almost always very formal. What<br />
is more noticeable, the less quality as a professional one<br />
represents the more respect he require. Moreover, they cannot understand<br />
that informal behaviour does not imply less respect. It is connected<br />
with the system ruling our education. I would like to change it<br />
entirely, but I will need allies to be successful.</p>
<p>The Polish teachers are often proud that when a Polish<br />
schoolchild emigrates to the US, he/she is much better at math or geography<br />
than his/her American mates. The teachers consider then Polish<br />
syllabus far more better than American one. They seem not to notice that<br />
the only thing which is more demanding is the very ambitious<br />
syllabus, but the results of the most of students are pitiable. I teach in<br />
the secondary school, but previously I used to work in primary<br />
schools. What I can say is that Polish school try to teach very large<br />
piece of material, but nobody can give a reasonable answer for what. Young<br />
people cannot develop their personalities because they simply<br />
have not got time for their interests. The most of their time is devoted<br />
to the subjects they hate. Furthermore, they realise very well that<br />
half of that knowledge will never have even chance to be used.<br />
Motivation in Polish school is close to zero. On the other hand when someone<br />
turns attention of society to that problem, is considered as one<br />
who wants to bring up a generation of illiterates. Polish parents are<br />
mostly conservative and always stand their own old teachers as<br />
examples of true educational virtue, though they used to hate<br />
them when they were students. Thus if a teacher tries to be &#8220;too&#8221;<br />
democratic, the parents alarm the school principle.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what the targets of Polish school are. Much of<br />
knowledge, almost no skills, and a state of alienation of education. I<br />
borrowed the term &#8220;alienation&#8221; from Marx (his &#8220;alienation of labour&#8221;) and<br />
Feuerbach (&#8220;alienation of religion&#8221;), but I think it is the best<br />
word to describe the problem. In my opinion, since the time when<br />
children stopped being educated by their parents in hunting, crafts and<br />
agriculture, and the institution of school appeared, mankind have<br />
been observing the process of alienation of education, which more or<br />
less has been loosing its contact with reality. Of course it depended<br />
on historical period, country and culture. In Poland the situation<br />
is tragical. When I wrote an article and sent it to &#8220;Gazeta<br />
Wyborcza&#8221; (I think the best newspaper in Poland), they answered that they<br />
published only Famous People&#8217;s opinion. I do not belong to those<br />
who can be easy offended, because the problem is too serious to give<br />
up. I thanked them for accelerating me towards becoming a Famous<br />
Person. The next day they published an article of Dr Samson, the<br />
psychologist. He criticised the teachers in such a rude way that it was<br />
embarrassing to read. Moreover, he did not suggest any solution of the<br />
problem. In Poland we have the greatest number of the critics, criticising<br />
is our national custom, but it results with nothing. Everybody love to<br />
pretend to do something, nobody takes responsibility.</p>
<p>The universities in Poland are ridiculous equally. It is<br />
difficult to find a scholar who is courageous enough to publish his original<br />
idea. If the &#8220;scientific work&#8221; is not full of footnotes(they can occupy<br />
more than half a page), in which the author recalls other<br />
&#8220;scientific authorities&#8221;, his book or article will be considered as<br />
worthless. Horror. The same stupid opinions are repeated over and over<br />
again. It is very difficult to achieve the doctor degree before one&#8217;s<br />
thirties. If one wants to become a professor, he must wait till<br />
he is about fifty or sixty. I hope the situation will soon change, but<br />
many of us would like it to be changed immediately, because we do not<br />
have time to waste.</p>
<p>Well, I have criticised &#8220;the critics&#8221;, but I have not written<br />
anything about my ideas of improvement of the Polish educational<br />
system. If it does not bother you, I&#8217;ll write it in my next message.<br />
I have to go downstairs to my class.<br />
It is fantastic to hear that you are interested in visiting<br />
Poland. I talked to my lecturers about it. My teacher of psychology<br />
received that news enthusiastically. She said that the Department of<br />
Psychology would be interested in your visit very much. What is important,<br />
it is a rich enough department, which can be a sponsor of our<br />
invitation. You know, I am afraid they will expect you to give one lecture,<br />
my teachers of English would be happy to listen to your lecture on<br />
linguistics, but I think it will be enough. The rest of your time<br />
you could spend visiting interesting places in Poland. I can assure<br />
you, there is much to see. The suggestion of the university people is<br />
that you come during the academic year (October-May), and the best<br />
would be if you come to us from somewhere in Europe. They say our branch<br />
cannot afford the ticket from America. But I think everything can<br />
be done all right for both you and our university.<br />
Please, if you find some spare time, write to me, and tell me<br />
what the date would be the most convenient to you to visit us.</p>

<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know what was the matter with the MIT computer.  Anyway,<br />
your message did get through, though I just got it.  I&#8217;ve been<br />
away, speaking.  Usual routine.</p>
<p>It was most interesting to hear what you had to say about Polish<br />
education.  Incidentally, I don&#8217;t recall off-hand about the word<br />
itself, but I&#8217;m sure that the concept of alienation was not<br />
original with Marx.  It was common in the intellectual circles<br />
in of French-German Romanticism in which he grew up, and is explicit<br />
in von Humboldt, at least.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty common to criticism the US educational system as<br />
shallow, and it surely has its faults, many of them.  But I&#8217;ve<br />
never agreed with much of the criticism.  At the college level<br />
particularly, the American system seems to me far and away the<br />
best one I&#8217;ve found anywhere.  And at earlier levels, the fat<br />
that attention is given to allowing children to develop their<br />
personal interests, skills (including social skills), and so on,<br />
has always seemed to me basically a good feature, actually one<br />
that should be emphasized far more (I was lucky myself in that<br />
I was at an experimental progressive Deweyite school from 18 months<br />
&#8212; my parents both worked &#8212; to age 12; the best educational<br />
experience I&#8217;ve ever had, or seen).  What you describe about<br />
Polish universities in particular seems to me rather like the<br />
European norm, though it has been changing some, I suppose: the<br />
Professor a tyrant whom one obeys, etc.  Many of the problems you<br />
mention are found here too, though much more in the humanities<br />
and social sciences than in the natural sciences, at least in my<br />
experience.  Not that natural scientists have better genes.  It&#8217;s<br />
simply that you can&#8217;t be part of the game unless you keep pretty<br />
honest (deceit will be quickly exposed, generally), and<br />
innovative and creative, and students, at least at the better<br />
universities, aren&#8217;t really &#8220;taught&#8221; the sciences &#8212; it&#8217;s more<br />
like picking up a craft in an apprenticeship relation, with the<br />
students expected to challenge, disprove, and innovate.  Very<br />
different from other areas, even here, more so elsewhere.  One<br />
of the reasons I&#8217;ve never thought of leaving MIT, to tell you the<br />
truth.  In fact, one of the achievements of my which friend<br />
Morris Halle and I are most proud is that the field of<br />
linguistics, insofar as it grew from here, has retained those<br />
characteristics elsewhere, including large parts of the world.</p>
<p>About visiting, I really would like to do so, though it won&#8217;t be<br />
easy to arrange.  But I should say that I almost never go<br />
anywhere unless I combine &#8220;professional&#8221; and &#8220;political&#8221; talks<br />
&#8212; using the conventional categories, which I don&#8217;t like much<br />
myself.  About the only exception is Japan, the only country I<br />
know, outside of dictatorships (where I don&#8217;t go), where very few<br />
educated people, including students, seem interested in much<br />
beyond very specific technical concerns.  And where,<br />
incidentally, the educational system has characteristics of the<br />
kind you describe, sometimes in a kind of caricature.  It&#8217;s often<br />
reminded me of some very interesting work done by a group of the<br />
most outstanding Japanese economists, published about 10 years<br />
ago, in which they reviewed, in several volumes, their postwar<br />
economic development.  They&#8217;d all been trained in the West, and<br />
were of course being given all sorts of expert advice (sometimes<br />
orders) under the US occupation and afterwards.  But as they<br />
report it, they decided not to follow the prescriptions of US<br />
classical economics, but rather a different model of state-guided<br />
development, borrowing in part from their own tradition, but in<br />
part from the Marxist-Bolshevik model &#8212; with the difference that<br />
they would be honest and efficient, not corrupt gangsters.  It&#8217;s<br />
not totally false.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11 Apr 96</p>
<p>Dear Noam,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your last message. I hope everything is<br />
all right with the servers.<br />
We were talking about education in Poland. Recently has the communist<br />
minister of education been criticised in my country for doing<br />
nothing for the field he&#8217;s responsible for. He answered that the best way<br />
for the opposition to introduce what they want is to win the next<br />
election. The arrogance of people in charge is horrible. Our<br />
present minister of education used to be known as a chief Marxist<br />
theoretician during the communist period. I remember his books when I studied<br />
history. We were obliged to read some extracts from his pseudo-<br />
sociological elaborates. His presence at the ministerial post is<br />
like a return of the mythological monster. Most of people in Poland<br />
don&#8217;t take it so seriously as I do, because they simply are not<br />
interested in the problems of education.</p>
<p>I personally believe that the system of alienated education<br />
can be eliminated by wiser motivating. Now the only motivation a<br />
teacher can provide his student with is fear. I can observe my students<br />
how stressed they are, when I require the basic knowledge of history.<br />
The problem is that I am controlled too, so I have to realize the<br />
national syllabus, although it is far too large and useless. My<br />
lessons often look like &#8220;The Hotline News&#8221;, because I try to tell<br />
the students everything within 45 minutes. They can&#8217;t make notes, and<br />
unfortunately they can&#8217;t use their manuals, because I have no<br />
time to explain them how to use the manual or any written text<br />
effectively. I myself learned to read effectively as late as my last year of<br />
my university period. And I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;mind-mapping&#8221; or other so<br />
popular American methods of fast reading. I simply taught myself to<br />
select the most important things and to go through the material from<br />
general information to detailed. Nothing new, but if someone had told me<br />
about it earlier, he would have spared me a lot of stress. I want<br />
to do that to my students but I simply don&#8217;t have time, because I<br />
must give them FACTS. Of course I exaggerate because I take a risk and<br />
devote some of my time for teaching them some skills, but it is<br />
not a solution. A solution is a structural change of educational<br />
system.</p>
<p>What I always discuss with my friends-teachers is the problem<br />
of discipline in the class. Sometimes I can&#8217;t understand that they<br />
seem to think about the discipline as about a goal for itself, not as<br />
about a mean to achieving a goal. They unconsciously want to make<br />
young people constantly obedient, so after finishing school such<br />
a graduate is still helpless, naive and he/she looks for<br />
someone&#8221;wiser&#8221; to manage him/her. Nothing strange that so called &#8220;people of<br />
success&#8221; didn&#8217;t used to be good students. They were independent instead.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t have much time, but I&#8217;d like to share with you<br />
the impression the movie &#8220;Underground&#8221; made on me. I don&#8217;t know if<br />
you have seen this picture by Emir Kusturica. I saw that film three<br />
days ago and I can&#8217;t stop thinking about it. It made me think about<br />
the mechanism of human hatred, of forgetting the basic human norms,<br />
and the causes of those. I&#8217;m thinking of all those stupid events<br />
which seemingly means nothing, and actually may cause big catastrophes.<br />
I hope people will learn to use psychology to prevent themselves<br />
from using violence. By the way, I wonder what your opinion about the<br />
US forces intervention is. I know you were against the Americans in<br />
Vietnam, I know your opinion about the role of the US government<br />
in South America, but what do you think about the necessity of<br />
intervention in such places as former Yugoslavia. Should the<br />
strongest powers let people in Rwanda or Kurdystan murder and be<br />
slaughtered?<br />
What is your opinion? Please write about it. After the<br />
Kusturica&#8217;s film I&#8217;m starving for various opinions about it.</p>
<p>Please, if possible write when your timetable let you to come<br />
to Poland. I realise you are busy, but if you can tell me when<br />
approximately you&#8217;ll be free enough to visit my country. I can<br />
assure you there is much to see here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for your answer.</p>
<p>Stefan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15 May 1996</p>
<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>Neither offended, nor bored.  Just overwhelmed.  I&#8217;m racing madly<br />
trying to keep up with a very intense hour-by-hour schedule, and<br />
correspondence has fallen into a pit.  I&#8217;ll be in touch as soon<br />
as I extricate myself, in a few weeks, I hope.</p>
<p>Rights of the superpowers to intervene?  Why the superpowers?<br />
Thus in Bosnia, there was one country that was willing to<br />
intervene, and could have done so: Iran.  No one took it<br />
seriously, me included, because there is no reason to believe<br />
that their intervention would be &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; in any sense, or<br />
helpful.  Is the record of the superpowers better than that of<br />
Iran, in this regard?  Fact is that the category of &#8220;humanitarian<br />
intervention&#8221; is singularly empty.  When we consider the reasons,<br />
which are pretty clear, the question takes on a different light.</p>
<p>One has to ask, in each case, what would be the consequences of<br />
direct military intervention, which is bound to be for completely<br />
cynical reasons, as throughout history; I can&#8217;t think of an<br />
exception.  Sometimes cynical acts are still justifiable.  Thus<br />
one might argue that the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in<br />
1978-9 &#8212; which probably is the best candidate for &#8220;humanitarian<br />
intervention&#8221; &#8212; was justified, because it terminated Pol Pot&#8217;s<br />
atrocities; and, predictably, led to huge outrage in the West and<br />
severe punishment of Vietnam for this crime.  To be sure, their<br />
motives weren&#8217;t humanitarian; they are like everyone else in that<br />
respect.  But the cynicism of the reaction is pretty spectacular.</p>
<p>Take the cases you mention.  In Chechnya intervention is not an<br />
option, unless we want to face nuclear war.  It&#8217;s like asking<br />
whether Russia should have intervened when US-run terrorist<br />
forces were killing tens of thousands of people in Central<br />
America in the &#8217;80s: certainly not.  What about Palestine?  The<br />
major problem there precise IS great power intervention: namely,<br />
the US refusal for 25 years to permit any diplomatic settlement,<br />
and its insistence on ramming through its own extreme<br />
rejectionist program, as it has now done.  I&#8217;ve written about<br />
this, if you are interested.  What about Bosnia?  It&#8217;s<br />
interesting that no serious proposal for Western military<br />
intervention was ever put forth (and the one offer that was made,<br />
Iran, was never considered).  I think it&#8217;s easy to see why.  The<br />
US is now proceeding to implement the effective partition of<br />
Bosnia that has been at the core of European-US policy all along,<br />
but in a way that will kick out the Europeans after they were<br />
faced with the dirty work, so that the US can restore something<br />
like the status quo ante, with as Croatian (quasi-fascist) client<br />
state and, Washington hopes, the same with Serbia.</p>
<p>A lot more to say about all the cases, but this seems to me the<br />
essence.  In general, before considering the abstract &#8220;right of<br />
intervention,&#8221; we should pay careful attention to sociopolitical<br />
and historical realities &#8212; at least, if we are concerned with<br />
the fate of the victims.</p>
