		<h1>A portrait of Chomsky as a young Zionist</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky interviewed by Gabriel Matthew Schivone</h2>
<h3><em><a href="http://newvoices.org/2011/11/07/0136-2/" target="_blank">New Voices</a></em>, November 7, 2011</h3>
<p>SCHIVONE: You&#8217;ve mentioned that you were a Zionist youth organizer opposed to a Jewish state. What sort of Zionism did you and other youth envision and want to organize around?</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: I was connected to a considerable part of the Zionist movement which was opposed to a Jewish state. It&#8217;s not too well known, but until 1942 there was no official commitment of Zionist organizations to a Jewish state. And even that was in the middle of World War II. It was a decision made in the Hotel Biltmore in New York, where there was the first official call for a Jewish state. Before that in the whole Zionist movement, establishing a Jewish state was maybe implicit or in people&#8217;s minds or something, but it wasn&#8217;t an official call.</p>
<p>The group that I was interested in was bi-nationalist. And that was not so small. A substantial part of the Kibbutz movement, for example, Hashomer Hatzair, was at least officially anti-state, calling for bi-nationalism. And the groups I was connected with were hoping for a socialist Palestine based on Arab-Jewish, working-class cooperation in a bi-national community: no state, no Jewish state, just Palestine.</p>
<p>There were significant figures involved in that. Actually one of them in Philadelphia was Zellig Harris, the guy I ended up studying with at the University of Pennsylvania. He was one of the leaders of a group called Avukah. By the time I got there it had disbanded but through the 1930s and early 1940s it was quite an important organization of left-wing, Zionist, anti-state, young Jews. Plenty of people went through that &#8212; a lot of people who are pretty well-known now &#8212; from all over the place. It was not an insignificant part of the young, left Jewish community in the United States, and happened to be partially in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I can remember when the UN partition resolution was announced in 1947. It was almost like mourning in these circles because we didn&#8217;t want a Jewish state.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American Commission claimed that about 25% of the Jewish population in Palestine was opposed to a state. There was kind of a different mentality at the time. To talk about socialism wasn&#8217;t considered a joke at that time. It was a real meaningful, live phenomenon. And a large part of the Yishuv &#8212; the Jewish community in Palestine &#8212; was, in fact, a co-operative community with collectives, co-operative industry, commerce, lots of socialist institutions. They were also racist Jews. But there was also a lot of opposition to that, too in our groups. We thought they should be Arab-Jewish.</p>
<p>From about then, from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, I think bi-nationalism was actually a feasible objective. Even then it could have moved in that direction. By then it would have taken a different form than pre-1948, of course. But there could have been moves toward a kind of federalism, which might have evolved further into a more integrated, bi-national community. And, in fact, even elements of Israeli intelligence were pressing for something like this.</p>
<p>By 1975, the opportunity had been lost. By that time, Palestinian nationalism had entered the international agenda and mainly among Palestinians. And since about 1975, I don&#8217;t think there has been any way of realizing objectives like that except in stages with a two-state settlement being the first stage. If there was some other way of doing that, I&#8217;d be in favor of that, but I&#8217;ve never heard of it.</p>
<p>People now talk about one state &#8212; which would, of course, be a bi-national state &#8212; but without saying how you get there. At that time of my youth, there was, pre-1948. In the early 1970s, it was possible to think about how to get there directly. Now, as far as I can see, the only way to achieve goals like that is indirectly, through a two-state.</p>
<p>And incidentally, I&#8217;ve never been really in favor of a bi-national state because I don&#8217;t see any reason to worship the imperial borders. They&#8217;re perfectly arbitrary. Actually, when my wife and I lived on a kibbutz back in the early 1950s, we were backpacking around the place.</p>
<p>SCHIVONE: Before you were at MIT?</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: Before MIT, we were grad students. We were backpacking in the Northern Galilee, in Israel. We happened to cross the border. The border wasn&#8217;t marked. We didn&#8217;t know. There was a road, and we just walked across the border. The only reason we knew is, a jeep came by on the Israeli side and the guy started yelling at us, telling us to get back on that side. But aside from the imperial powers, there&#8217;s no reason to honor those borders. There ought to be a more regional integration, in which communities run their affairs as integrated as they choose &#8212; sort of what existed under the Ottoman Empire. True, nobody wants the Ottoman Empire but some of the structures it had were pretty reasonable for that area.</p>
<p>SCHIVONE: Was going to live there part of actualizing your ideals of Arab-Jewish cooperation?</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: Yeah, at the time we intended to. We were in the middle of school and thought we would go back and stay. In fact, my wife went back and stayed for a longer period. We thought we might go and never did. There were a lot of impediments. The country [Israel] was very different from the way it is now, but there were a lot of problems. But at that time these were not considered outlandish ideas. They were not at the center of the Zionist movement but they were an element of it.</p>
