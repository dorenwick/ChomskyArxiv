<h2>Noam Chomsky Interviewed by C.J. Polychroniou</h2>
<h3>February 3, 2020. <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/noam-chomsky-sanders-threatens-the-establishment-by-inspiring-popular-movements/">TruthOut</a>.</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">i</span><span data-contrast="auto">mpeachment trial of Donald Trump for power abuses is </span><span data-contrast="auto">winding down</span><span data-contrast="auto">, with his acquittal all but ensured</span><span data-contrast="auto"> when the Senate </span><span data-contrast="auto">re</span><span data-contrast="auto">convenes on</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Wednesday to vote on the articles of impeachment</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Yet, his real crimes continue to receive scant attention, and it is </span><span data-contrast="auto">Sen. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Bernie Sanders who is regarded by the political establishment as the most dangerous politician because of his commitment to a just and equitable social order and a sustainable future.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Meanwhile, the conclusion of the Davos meeting in January demonstrate</span><span data-contrast="auto">d</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the global elites’ ongoing commitment to unimpeded planetary destruction.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is indeed the state of the contemporary U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> political environment, as </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">great public intellectual Noam Chomsky points out </span><span data-contrast="auto">in this</span><span data-contrast="auto"> exclusive interview for </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Truthout.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>C.</strong><b><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>J</strong>. </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Polychroniou</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">: The impeachment trial of Donald Trump is</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">nearly </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">over, and what a farce it has been — something you had predicted from the start, which is also the reason why you thought that an impeachment inquiry was a rather foolish move on the part of the Democrats. With that in mind, what does this farcical episode tell us about the contemporary state of U</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">S</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> politics, and do you anticipate any political fallout </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">in</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">the 2020 election?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Noam Chomsky:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> It seemed clear from the outset that the impeachment effort could not be serious, and would end up being another gift by the Democrats to Trump, much as the Mueller affair was. Any doubts about its farcical nature were put to rest by its opening spectacle: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts struggling to keep a straight face while swearing in </span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">enators who solemnly pledged that they would be unmoved by partisan concerns, and at once proceeded </span><span data-contrast="auto">— </span><span data-contrast="auto">as everyone know they would </span><span data-contrast="auto">—</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to behave and vote along strictly party lines. Could there be a clearer exhibition of pure farce?</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Are the crimes </span><span data-contrast="auto">discussed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a basis for impeachment? Seems so to me. Has Trump committed vastly more serious crimes? That is hardly debatable. What might be debatable is whether he is indeed the most dangerous </span><span data-contrast="auto">criminal in human history (which happens to be my personal view). Hitler had been perhaps the leading candidate for this honor. His goal was to rid the German-run world of Jews, Roma, homosexuals and other </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">deviants,</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> along with tens of millions of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Slav</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Untermenschen</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> But Hitler was not dedicated with fervor to destroying the prospects of organized human life on </span><span data-contrast="auto">E</span><span data-contrast="auto">arth in the not-distant future (along </span><span data-contrast="auto">with </span><span data-contrast="auto">millions of other species).</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump is. And those who think he doesn’t know what he’s doing haven’t been looking closely.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Is that a wild and ludicrous exaggeration? Or the very simple and apparent truth</span><span data-contrast="auto">?</span><span data-contrast="auto"> It’s not difficult to figure out the answer. We’ve discussed it often before. There is no need to review what is happening on Trump’s watch while he devotes every effort to accelerating the race to catastrophe, trailed by such lesser lights as </span><span data-contrast="none">Brazil’s Jair </span><span data-contrast="none">Bolsonaro</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="none">Australia’s Scott Morrison</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Every day brings new forebodings. We have just learned, for example, that the gigantic </span><span data-contrast="auto">Thwaites Glacier</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in West Antarctica has been eroding from warm water below</span><span data-contrast="auto">. The </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Washington Post</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">describes this</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as “</span><span data-contrast="none">a troubling finding that could speed its melt in a region with the potential to eventually unleash more than</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">10 feet</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">of sea-level rise</span><span data-contrast="none">,” adding, “</span><span data-contrast="none">Scientists already knew that Thwaites was losing massive amounts of ice </span><span data-contrast="none">—</span><span data-contrast="none"> more than</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">600 billion tons</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">over the past several decades, and most recently as much as 50 billion tons per year.</span><span data-contrast="none">” </span><span data-contrast="none">It has now been confirmed, as suspected, that</span><span data-contrast="none"> “</span><span data-contrast="none">this was occurring because a layer of relatively warmer ocean water, which circles Antarctica below the colder surface layer, had moved closer to shore and begun to eat away at the glaciers themselves, affecting West Antarctica in particular.</span><span data-contrast="none">” </span><span data-contrast="none">The chief scientist involved in the study warns that this may signal</span><span data-contrast="none"> “</span><span data-contrast="none">an unstoppable retreat that has huge implications for global </span><span data-contrast="none">sea-level rise.</span>”</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s today. Tomorrow will be something worse.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What’s causing the warmer water? No secret. This is only one of the likely irreversible tipping points that may be reached if “the Chosen One,” as he modestly describes himself, is granted another four years to carry out his project of global destruction.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">We have just witnessed an extraordinary event at the January Davos meeting of the Masters of the Universe, as they are called; for Adam Smith</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> they were only “the masters of mankind,” but 250 years ago it was just British merchants and manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The conference opened with Trump’s</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">oration about what a fabulous creature he is. The encomium was interrupted only by a comment that we should not be</span><span data-contrast="none"> “</span><span data-contrast="none">alarmist</span><span data-contrast="none">” </span><span data-contrast="none">about the climate. His Magnificence was followed by the quiet and informed comments of a </span><span data-contrast="none">17-year old girl</span><span data-contrast="none"> instructing the heads of state, CEOs, media leaders and grand intellectuals about what it means to be a responsible adult.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Quite a spectacle.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump’s war on organized life on </span><span data-contrast="auto">E</span><span data-contrast="auto">arth is only the barest beginning. More narrowly, in recent days</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">C</span><span data-contrast="auto">hosen </span><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">ne has issued executive orders ridding the country of the plague of regulations that protect children from mercury poisoning and preserve the country’s water supplies and lands, along with other impediments to further enrichment of Trump’s primary constituency, extreme wealth and corporate power.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On the side, he has been casually proceeding to dismantle the last vestiges of the arms control regime that has provided some limited degree of security from terminal nuclear war, eliciting cheers from the military industry. And as we have just learned, the great pacifist who is committed to end interventions “</span><span data-contrast="none">dropped more bombs</span><span data-contrast="none"> and other munitions in Afghanistan last year than any other year since documentation began in 2006, Air Force data shows</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-contrast="none">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">He is also ramping up his acts of war </span><span data-contrast="auto">— </span><span data-contrast="auto">which is what they are </span><span data-contrast="auto">—</span><span data-contrast="auto"> against Iran. I won’t even go into his giving Israel what the Israeli press calls “a gift to the right,” formally giving the back of his imperial hand to international law, the World Court, the UN Security Council and overwhelming international opinion, while shoring up the Evangelical vote for the 2020 election. The prerogative of supreme power.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In brief, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the list of Trump’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> crimes is immense, not least the worst crime in human history. But none merit a nod in the impeachment proceedings</span><span data-contrast="auto">. This is hardly a novelty; rather the norm. The current proceedings are often compared with Watergate. Nixon’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> hideous crimes were eliminated from the charges against him despite the efforts of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Rep. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Robert Frederick Drinan</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">a few others. The Nixon impeachment charges focused on his illegal acts to harm Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Any resemblance to the farce that is now winding up? Does it suggest some insight into what motivates the powerful?</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Speaking of the 2020 election, the corporate Democratic establishment and the liberal media</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> are once again mobilizing to undermine Bernie Sanders</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">, even though he may very well be the most electable </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">D</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">emocrat. First, can you summarize for us what you perceive to be the core of Sanders’</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">s </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">politico-ideological gestalt, and then explain what scares both conservatives and liberals </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">— </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">the possibility of someone like Sanders leading the country?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The core of Sanders’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “</span><span data-contrast="auto">politico-ideological gestalt</span><span data-contrast="auto">” </span><span data-contrast="auto">is his long-standing commitment to the interests of the large majority of the population, not the top 0.1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> percent</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (not 1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> percent</span><span data-contrast="auto">, 0.1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> percent</span><span data-contrast="auto">) who hold more than </span><span data-contrast="none">20</span><span data-contrast="none"> percent</span><span data-contrast="none"> of the country’s wealth</span><span data-contrast="auto">, not the very rich who were the prime beneficiaries of the slow recovery from the 2008 disaster caused by financial capital. The U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> achievement in this regard far surpasses that of other developed countries, so we learn from recently released studies, which </span><span data-contrast="none">show</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that in the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> 65</span><span data-contrast="auto"> percent</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of the growth of the past decade went to the very rich; next in line was Germany, at 5</span><span data-contrast="auto">1 </span><span data-contrast="auto">percent</span><span data-contrast="auto">, then declining sharply. The same studies show that if current trends persist, in the next decade</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">all growth in the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will go to the rich.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The welfare of these sectors has never been Sanders’s concern.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Democratic establishment and liberal media are hardly likely to look kindly on someone who forthrightly proclaims, </span><span data-contrast="none">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">I have no use for those</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">—</span><span data-contrast="auto"> regardless of their political party</span><span data-contrast="auto"> — </span><span data-contrast="auto">who hold some foolish dream of spinning the clock back to days when unorganized labor was a huddled, almost helpless mass</span><span data-contrast="auto">….</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choic</span><span data-contrast="auto">e.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” </span><span data-contrast="auto">By </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">right to work</span><span data-contrast="auto">” l</span><span data-contrast="auto">aws, for example, or by hiring scabs, or by threatening to ship jobs to Mexico to undermine organizing efforts, to sample the bipartisan political leadership.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s surely the kind of socialist wild man whom the country is not ready to tolerate.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The wild man in this case is President Dwight Eisenhower, the last conservative president. His remarks are a good illustration of how far the political class has shifted to the right under Clintonite “New Democrats” and the Reagan-Gingrich Republicans. The latter have </span><span data-contrast="none">drifted so far off the political spectrum</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that they are ranked near neo-fascist parties in the international spectrum, well to the right of “conservatives.”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even more threatening than Sanders’s proposals to carry forward New Deal-style policies</span><span data-contrast="auto">, I think, </span><span data-contrast="auto">is his inspiring a popular movement that is steadily engaged in political action and direct activism to change the social order</span><span data-contrast="auto"> — a movement of people, mostly young, who have not internalized the norms of liberal democracy: that the public are “ignorant and meddlesome outsiders” who are to be “spectators, not participants in action,” entitled to push </span><span data-contrast="auto">a lever every four years but are then to return to their TV sets and video games while the “responsible men” look after serious matters.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is a fundamental principle of democracy as expounded by prominent and influential liberal 20</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto">century American intellectuals, who took cognizance of “the stupidity of the average man” and recognized that we should not be deluded by “democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests.” They are not; we are — the “responsible men,” the “intelligent minority.” The “bewildered herd” must therefore be “put in their place” by “necessary illusions” and “emotionally potent simplifications.” These are among the pronouncements of the most influential 20</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto">century public intellectual, Walter Lippmann, in his “progressive essays on democracy”; Harold </span><span data-contrast="auto">Lasswell</span><span data-contrast="auto">, one of the founders of modern political science; and Reinhold Niebuhr, the admired “theologian of the (liberal) establishment.” All highly respected Wilson-FDR-Kennedy liberals.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Inspiring a popular movement that violates these norms is a serious attack on democracy, so conceived, an intolerable assault against good order.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">I believe we witnessed something similar in the last U</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">K</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> elections in the case of Jeremy Corbyn. Do you agree? And, </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">i</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">f so, what does this tell us about liberal democracy, which is nowadays in serious trouble itself on </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">account of the rise and spread of authoritarianism and the far right in many parts of the world?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are definite similarities. Corbyn, a decent and honorable man, was subjected to an extraordinary flood of vilification and defamation, which he was unable to confront. At the same time, polls indicated that the policies that he put forth</span><span data-contrast="auto"> —</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and that had led to a remarkable victory for </span><span data-contrast="auto">Labour</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in 2017</span><span data-contrast="auto"> —</span><span data-contrast="auto"> remained popular. A special feature in the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">K</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> was Brexit, a matter I won’t go into here (my personal opinion, for what it’s worth, is that it is a serious blow to both Britain and the EU, and is likely to cause Britain — or what remains of it — to become even more of a vassal of the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> than it has been under Blair’s New </span><span data-contrast="auto">Labour</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and the Tories, whose social and economic policies have caused the country great harm). Corbyn’s vacillation on the Brexit issue, which became a toxic one, surely contributed to the negative feelings about him that seem to have been a major factor in the electoral disaster for </span><span data-contrast="auto">Labour</span><span data-contrast="auto">, but it was only one.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As in the case of Sanders, I suspect that the prime reason for the bitter hatred of Corbyn on the part of a very wide spectrum of the British establishment is his effort to turn the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Labour</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Party into a participatory organization that would not leave electoral politics in the hands of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Labour</span><span data-contrast="auto"> bureaucracy and would proceed beyond the narrow realm of electoral politics to far broader and constant activism and engagement in public affairs.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">More generally, much of the world is aflame. As the men of Davos recognized with trepidation at their January meeting, the peasants are coming with their pitchforks: </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">he neoliberal order they have imposed for the past 40 years, while ultra-generous to them and their class, has had a bitter impact on the general population. A leading theme at Davos was that the Masters must declare that they are changing their stance from service to the rich to attending to the concerns of “stakeholders” — working people and communities. Another theme was that while not “alarmists,” they acknowledge the threat of global warming.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The unstated implication is that there is no need for regulations and other actions about climate change</span><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">We Big Boys will take care of it. Greta </span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto">Thunberg </span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto">and the other children demonstrating out there can go back to school. And now that we see the flaws in our neoliberal model of capitalism, you can put aside all those disruptive political programs calling for health </span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto">care, rights of workers, women, the poor. We’re taking care of it, so just go back to your private pursuits, keeping to democratic norms.</span></i></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As the neoliberal order is visibly collapsing, it is giving rise to “morbid symptoms” (to borrow Gramsci’s famous phrase when the fascist plague was looming). Among these are the spread of authoritarianism and the far right that you mention. More generally, what we are witnessing is quite understandable anger, resentment and contempt for the political institutions that have implemented the neoliberal assault — but also the rise of activist movements that seek to overcome the ills of global society and to stem and reverse the race to destruction.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The confrontation could hardly have been exhibited more dramatically than by the appearance of Greta Thunberg immediately after the most powerful man in the world</span><span data-contrast="auto"> — </span><span data-contrast="auto">the leader in the race to destruction</span><span data-contrast="auto"> —</span><span data-contrast="auto"> had admonished the Masters to disdain the “heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers” </span><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><span data-contrast="auto">virtually 100</span><span data-contrast="auto"> percent</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of climate scientists</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and to take up his wrecking ball.</span></p>
