		<h1>Chomsky: Europe May Face Decline, Deindustrialization by Staying in &#8216;US-Dominated System&#8217;</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky Interviewed by Sputnik </h2>
<h3>May 31, 2023. <em><a href="https://sputnikglobe.com/20230531/chomsky-europe-may-face-decline-deindustrialization-by-staying-in-us-dominated-system-1110807834.html">Sputnik</a>. </em></h3>


<p>Europe will experience a likely decline and deindustrialization if it chooses to stay within the system dominated by the United States, renowned US academic and philosopher Noam Chomsky told Sputnik.</p>



<p>&#8220;Europe has a major decision to make: Will it stay within the US-dominated system, facing likely decline and even, some predict, deindustrialization?&#8221; Chomsky said. &#8220;Or will it accommodate in some fashion to its natural economic partner to the East, rich in mineral resources that Europe needs and a gateway to the lucrative China market?&#8221;</p>



<p>Chomsky noted that these questions have arisen in one form or another since World War II.</p>



<p>When asked whether he thinks we are on the threshold of a new world order and if the Ukrainian conflict can be a catalyst for major changes, Chomsky said: &#8220;There is much controversy about the shape of the emerging world system.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chomsky explained the basic alternatives are a multipolar United Nations-based system or a unipolar &#8220;rules-based&#8221; system, where the United States sets the rules and as the record reveals, disregards them when it chooses to.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are many uncertainties as to how these tensions will be resolved,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Earlier in May, US investor Jim Rogers told Sputnik that political unions like the European Union have never survived in history and this bloc is already experiencing problems.</p>



<p>The renowned US academic and philosopher further told Sputnik that he is hopeful Europe will be inclined toward the vision of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev &#8216;From Lisbon to Vladivostok&#8217; before it gets worse.</p>



<p>“I also think there is considerable merit in Gorbachev&#8217;s proposal for a ‘common European home’ from Lisbon to Vladivostok with no military alliances and common efforts to move toward a social democratic future,” Chomsky said.</p>



<p>The United States chose to pursue the Atlanticist option, based on NATO, which has recently been expanded to the Indo-Pacific region in a Washington-led effort to enlist Europe in its confrontation with China, Chomsky said.</p>



<p>None of the actions taken by the successors of former US President George H.W. Bush in violation of the agreements between him and then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on NATO should have taken place, Chomsky said.</p>



<p>Chomsky noted that Bush and Gorbachev agreed that Germany should be unified and join NATO, but the military alliance should not extend &#8220;one inch to the East&#8221; of Germany.</p>



<p>However, Chomsky said Bush’s successor, Bill Clinton, violated the agreement, overriding the strong objections of high-level US diplomats and a wide range of political analysts, who warned that actions to expand NATO were reckless and provocative.</p>



<p>&#8220;His successors went further, also abrogating major arms control agreements that had significantly reduced the threat of war. None of these actions should have taken place, in my opinion,&#8221; Chomsky said.</p>
