		<h1>Reexamining History with Noam Chomsky: US Elite&#8217;s view of European Fascism before WW2</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky interviewed by Zain Raza</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.actvism.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/160930_Chomsky_US-Elite_Facism_TRANSCRIPT.pdf">AcTVism Munich</a>, September 30, 2016</h3>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: This transcript may not be 100% accurate. The original video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJCST5akQQo">here</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Zain Raza: Welcome to Actvism Munich. Professor Noam Chomsky, thank you for joining us again. Glad to<br />
be with you. I want to start with some historical perspective and let&#8217;s work our way up from there.<br />
Before the Second World War what view did the United States government had of fascism in<br />
Germany? What was the political and military relationship between Berlin and Washington?</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky: Well it was a mixed story. Roosevelt himself had a mixed attitude. For example: he was pretty<br />
supportive of Mussolini&#8217;s fascism, in fact described Mussolini as that admirable Italian<br />
gentleman. He later concluded that Mussolini had been mislead by his association with Hitler and<br />
had been lead kind of down the wrong path. But the American business community, the power<br />
systems in the United States were highly supportive of Mussolini. In fact even parts of the labor<br />
bureaucracy were. Fortune Magazine for example, the major business journal, I think in 1932,<br />
had an issue with the headline, I’m quoting it: &#8220;The wops are unwopping themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;wop&#8221; is a kind of a derogatory term for Italians and the &#8220;wops&#8221; are finally &#8220;unwopping&#8221;<br />
themselves, under Mussolini they&#8217;re becoming part of the civilized world.</p>
<p>There was criticism of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, a lot of criticism. But basically pretty<br />
supportive attitude towards Mussolini&#8217;s fascism.</p>
<p>When Germany, when Hitler took over, the attitude was more mixed. There was a concern for a<br />
potential threat but nevertheless the general approach of the U.S., the British even more so, was<br />
fairly supportive. So, for example in 1937 the State Department described Hitler as a kind of a<br />
moderate, fending off the dangerous forces of the right (and left).</p>
<p>The State Department described Hitler as a moderate who was holding off the forces, the<br />
dangerous forces of the left, meaning the Bolsheviks, the labor movement and so on and of the<br />
right, namely the extremist Nazism. Hitler was kind of in the middle and therefore we should<br />
kind of support him. This is a pretty familiar stance, incidentally like in many other cases.<br />
George Kennan, later famous as one of the architects of post war policy, was actually the<br />
American Council in Berlin up until Pearl Harbor. He was sending back reports which are public,<br />
which were qualified. He said we shouldn&#8217;t be too harsh in condemning the Nazis since a lot of<br />
what they are doing is kind of understandable and we could get along with them and so on and<br />
this is one strain and a major one.</p>
<p>But there was also plenty of criticism and condemnation. But the general attitudes were fairly<br />
mixed. [This is sometimes called, when&#8230;] At the Munich Conference late 1938, Roosevelt sent<br />
his most trusted advisor, Sumner Wells to Munich and Wells came back with a pretty positive<br />
report saying we can really work with Hitler, this conference opens the possibility of a period of<br />
peace and justice for Europe and we should work out ways to interact and deal with him. That<br />
was late 1938! ok? and so it was quite a mixed story. Actually, there’s good scholarly literature<br />
on this if you want to go through the details.</p>
