<h2>Noam Chomsky in Conversation with C.J. Polychroniou</h2>
<h3>April 29, 2020. <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/chomsky-covid-19-has-exposed-the-us-under-trump-as-a-failed-state/">TruthOut</a>.</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The label “failed state” has started to fit the U.S. like a glove </span><span data-contrast="auto">as </span><span data-contrast="auto">the COVID-19 national health crisis </span><span data-contrast="auto">continues to reveal the </span><span data-contrast="auto">structural flaws and weaknesses of the United States,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> argues </span><span data-contrast="auto">world</span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto">renowned public intellectual </span><span data-contrast="auto">Noam Chomsky </span><span data-contrast="auto">in th</span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> exclusive interview for </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Truthout</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">M</span><span data-contrast="auto">eanwhile, the Trump administration continues to exact a high price in human lives due to its </span><span data-contrast="auto">caricaturish</span> <span data-contrast="auto">but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> highly dangerous </span><span data-contrast="auto">response to the crisis.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In the interview that follows, Chomsky also analyzes</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what’s behind Trump’s encouragement of the “anti-lockdown” protests, </span><span data-contrast="auto">discusses </span><span data-contrast="auto">the right-wing</span> <span data-contrast="auto">determination to destroy the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Postal Service, and lays out his views on the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> electoral</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “</span><span data-contrast="auto">l</span><span data-contrast="auto">esser </span><span data-contrast="auto">of</span> <span data-contrast="auto">t</span><span data-contrast="auto">wo </span><span data-contrast="auto">e</span><span data-contrast="auto">vils” principle.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">C.J. </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Polychroniou</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">: Noam, it is widely accepted by now that the U</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">S</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> coronavirus response not only was delayed, but remains mired in contradictions as Trump </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">battles with</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> scientists over policy. Moreover, the country as a whole was shown to be completely unprepared for a major health crisis. Are we talking here not simply of an incompetent administration but also of a failed state?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Noam Chomsky:</span></b> <span data-contrast="auto">Fifteen</span> <span data-contrast="auto">years ago</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I wrote a book called </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Failed States</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, a common locution in the day, referring to states that are incapable of meeting the needs of citizens, in the most important case because of deep policy choices, and are a danger not only to their own citizens but the world. The prime example was the United States. Extensive evidence was reviewed. That’s not of course the intended use of the phrase in the doctrinal system, just as “rogue state” means some enemy, not ourselves, the prime example.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I still stand by that judgment, which was not mine alone. A few years later, a Gallup/</span><span data-contrast="auto">W</span><span data-contrast="auto">IN</span> <span data-contrast="auto">international poll found that </span><span data-contrast="none">the U</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-contrast="none">S</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-contrast="none"> is regarded as the greatest threat to world peace</span><span data-contrast="auto">, no one else even close</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And the severe threats of government policy to the domestic population, already quite apparent when the book appeared, became much clearer a year later when the housing bubble burst and the financial crisis ensued — along with Obama’s response: bail out the perpetrators, who became richer and more powerful than before, and forget about the congressional legislation that called for some help to the many who had lost their homes in corporate scams facilitated by the </span><span data-contrast="none">Clinton-Rubin-Summers deregulation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> extravaganza</span><span data-contrast="auto">, extending the neoliberal assault on the population that took off under Reagan.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s a large part of the background for what finally brought us the Trump malignancy — which may, quite literally, doom human society on </span><span data-contrast="auto">E</span><span data-contrast="auto">arth. We’ve discussed elsewhere why this is no exaggeration. I hope that the basic facts and their dread import are well understood, and won’t review them here.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump has indeed hit America with a hammer blow — and much of the world as well, a matter we should not overlook. Just keeping to the current </span><span data-contrast="auto">C</span><span data-contrast="auto">OVID</span><span data-contrast="auto">-19 crisis, it is remarkable to see how little attention has been given to his sadistic assault against poor and suffering people around the world in pursuit of his goal of enhancing his electoral prospects.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There has been some attention to his extending his vicious attacks against refugees fleeing from misery and oppression, appealing to a deluded voter base that has been led to believe that refugees are the source of their suffering under the programs to which Trump is passionately committed.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But there is hardly a word about his attack against poor people in Africa, where unknown numbers will die thanks to his </span><span data-contrast="none">defunding of the </span><span data-contrast="none">World Health Organization</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (</span><span data-contrast="auto">WHO</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">, which has been protecting them from a wide range of diseases, now this new plague. Or about </span><span data-contrast="none">Palestinians in the occupied territories</span><span data-contrast="auto">, victims of Israel’s racist </span><span data-contrast="none">contempt for their health</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and other basic needs</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> amplified by Trump’s defunding of their meager health, educational and support systems generally because — as he explained — they weren’t treating him with enough respect while he’s smashing them in the face.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump’s withholding funds from the WHO was just the </span><span data-contrast="none">first step in his campaign to destroy the organization</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="none"> The campaign </span><span data-contrast="auto">provides real insight into the deeply</span> <span data-contrast="auto">rooted malevolence not only of Trump but of the gang he has collected around him, most of whom cower in silence </span><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><span data-contrast="auto">though some speak out</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">sometimes</span> <span data-contrast="auto">even outdoing the boss. Secretary of State </span><span data-contrast="auto">Mike </span><span data-contrast="auto">Pompeo</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">has been in the forefront of demonizing the WHO in support of Trump’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">increasingly desperate efforts to find a scapegoat for his terrible crimes against Americans. It doesn’t matter </span><span data-contrast="auto">how many miserable people are slaughtered in Africa and elsewhere in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">G</span><span data-contrast="auto">lobal South as crucial WHO services are undermined. Just “shithole countries” anyway, as the Dear Leader has explained.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is by now common understanding that the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> under Trump is a failed state that is a serious danger to the world. Diplomats speak in muted tones, not wanting to offend the raging beast in Washington who has unlimited power to destroy. But the meaning is clear when a “senior European official” says that </span><span data-contrast="none">“</span><span data-contrast="none">The U.S. administration is very fixated on the reelection campaign</span><span data-contrast="none"> and on who can get blamed for this catastrophic Covid-19 situation in the U.S. They are blaming WHO </span><span data-contrast="none">and China for it. </span><span data-contrast="none">Therefore</span><span data-contrast="none"> it is very difficult to agree on a common language about the WHO.”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The “common language” in question has to do with a UN Security Council resolution that the Trump administration is blocking. The resolution calls for “</span><span data-contrast="none">a</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">global ceasefire</span><span data-contrast="none"> pertaining to armed conflict in response to the pandemic [and urges] member states to </span><span data-contrast="none">‘</span><span data-contrast="none">share timely and transparent information regarding the outbreak of COVID-19</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-contrast="none">’” But the resolution is unacceptable to </span><span data-contrast="none">the </span><span data-contrast="none">White House, because it calls on countries to “support the full implementation of the WHO International Health Regulations.” As the senior European official said, asking countries to implement procedures to contain the crisis is harmful to Trump’s reelection campaign.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In brief, the dedication to slaughter poor and suffering people in pursuit of personal gain is so profound that even reference to WHO health regulations </span><span data-contrast="auto">cannot be mentioned. The WHO is reaching the status of climate change, a phrase that has to be excised from official documents dealing with the environment.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Across the board, Trump and his acolytes are echoing the words of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Francisco </span><span data-contrast="auto">Franco’s fascist </span><span data-contrast="auto">G</span><span data-contrast="auto">en</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span> <span data-contrast="none">Millán</span><span data-contrast="none"> Astray: “</span><span data-contrast="none">Down with intelligence! Long live death!</span><span data-contrast="none">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Turning directly to your question, I think </span><span data-contrast="auto">“incompetent” is not the right word for Trump’s malevolence, which turn</span><span data-contrast="auto">ed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> serious problems in the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> into </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">devastating crisis.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> But we should not overlook the serious problems inherited by the </span><span data-contrast="auto">cruel</span> <span data-contrast="auto">gang in today’s White House. It’s crucial to understand the background for the crisis if we hope to contain the next pandemic, likely to be worse than this one because of the impact of the global warming that is a far more severe threat.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At the root, there are three factors: general capitalist logic, the more </span><span data-contrast="auto">brutal</span> <span data-contrast="auto">neoliberal variant, and reactions by individual governments.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2003, after the SARS epidemic, scientists were well aware that a pandemic is likely, probably a related coronavirus. They also understood how to prepare for it — just as </span><span data-contrast="none">scientists today have a good idea as to how to prepare</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for the coming one</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But it’s not enough to know. Someone has to pick up the ball and run with it. The obvious candidate is Big Pharma, with huge resources, bloated with profits thanks to the exorbitant patent rights granted them under the highly protectionist “free trade” agreements. They’re ruled out, however, by normal capitalist logic. There’s no profit in preparing for a catastrophe down the road. And in fact it can be in their interest to </span><span data-contrast="none">impede a constructive response</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Next, the government could step in, but that’s blocked by the neoliberal intensification of capitalism’s inherent inhumanity. As Reagan declaimed in his </span><span data-contrast="auto">inauguration speech, government is the problem, not the solution. Translation: </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">ake decision-making away from government, which is at least partially responsive to public influence, and hand it over to private tyrannies that are unaccountable to the public. </span><span data-contrast="auto">An essential component of neoliberalism</span><span data-contrast="auto">, overt since its origins in interwar Vienna, </span><span data-contrast="auto">is that democracy is a threat that must be contained, even destroyed by state violence if necessary</span><span data-contrast="auto">, principles advocated in word and action by the gurus of the movement: Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and others. Furthermore, as Milton Friedman counselled in the Reagan years, the unaccountable tyrannies who control decision-making must be guided by sheer greed. Any concern for others would shake the foundations of civilization.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The creed was not strictly observed. Obama tried to evade it slightly, but the efforts were quickly smashed by capitalist logic (the </span><span data-contrast="none">ventilator-Covidien affair that we’ve discussed elsewhere</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is an example). But government intervention was largely blocked.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The third factor is the reactions of individual governments. They varied. China very quickly provided the WHO and the world with all relevant information. By early January</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Chinese scientists had identified the virus and sequenced the genome. Some countries at once reacted: Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand, a few others, </span><span data-contrast="auto">which</span> <span data-contrast="auto">now seem to have the crisis largely under control. Europe dithered but finally acted, with varying degrees of success.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At the bottom of the barrel is Trump, reflecting his dedication to his primary constituency, private wealth and corporate power, lightly hidden under a farcical display of “populism.” Throughout his term in office</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Trump has systematically pursued policies that enrich his primary constituency while harming others, including his adoring crowds. One part of this program was steadily defunding the Center</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for Disease Control </span><span data-contrast="auto">and Prevention</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (CDC)</span> <span data-contrast="auto">and dismantling programs that could have provided advance warning of what was likely to happen. As a result</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> was singularly unprepared.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Though the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and a few other failed states had all the information that led functioning societies to react appropriately, of course not all was entirely clear. That could hardly have been possible in such tumultuous circumstances. Like others, high U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> health officials had some </span><span data-contrast="none">uncertainty</span><span data-contrast="auto"> about what exactly was happening and how best to handle it.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Nevertheless, it was possible to take effective action, as shown by the record of governments that have some concern for their citizens. </span><span data-contrast="auto">U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> intelligence and health officials understood more than enough. Through January and February</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> they were trying to get through to the White House, but Trump was too busy watching his TV ratings. In the style of petty dictators, he has surrounded himself with sycophants or comical figures. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So,</span> <span data-contrast="auto">nothing from them. Or from the Republican Party, now trembling in fear of the crowds that can be mobilized by Trump and his corporate sponsors.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When some dare to inject a little rationality into administration discussions, they quickly learn their lessons, like the physician in charge of developing vaccines who was </span><span data-contrast="none">dismissed in April</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for warning against one of the quack medicines that Trump was advertising.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“Down with intelligence! Long live death!”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump should be given credit for his considerable achievements. It’s not easy to get away with holding up a banner with one hand saying “I love you, I’m our savior, I’m chosen by heaven to protect you,” while the other hand is stabbing you in the back. But Trump is doing it, brilliantly. He’s the supreme con man, who makes P.T. Barnum look like an amateur. He’s in a long tradition, back to trading tales for fun in the old West, to the self-declared King of France in Huckleberry Finn, to the guy who’ll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. Moving to a different sphere, we might also include the </span><span data-contrast="none">president who won the “marketer of the year” award</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from the Association of National Advertisers for his political campaign, easily defeating Apple and other amateurs</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and went on to win a Nobel Peace Prize for some pleasant rhetoric.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But </span><span data-contrast="auto">Trump is in a class by himself. Not just as a con man, but much more significantly as a dedicated enemy of the human race.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> That much is demonstrated by his policies on accelerating environmental catastrophe and dismantling the arms control regime that has provided some protection from terminal nuclear war, quite aside from a stream of peccadilloes of the kind already mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While praising Trump for his considerable achievements, we must also bear in mind that the health system that he has been wrecking was already in terrible shape. The privatized profit-driven health system in the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> was an international scandal long before Trump, with costs about twice as high as comparable countries and some of the worst outcomes. On the eve of the pandemic</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the costs of this dysfunctional system were estimated at </span><span data-contrast="none">$450 billion in wasted expense</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and 68,000 deaths annually by </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">T</span></i><i><span data-contrast="auto">he</span></i> <i><span data-contrast="auto">Lancet</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, one of the world’s leading medical journals.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond that, the neoliberal business model dictates that hospital care must be “efficient”: the minimum number of nurses and hospital beds to just get by in normal times — not much fun for patients even in normal times even at the world’s best hospitals, as many can attest (myself included). And if anything goes wrong, tough luck.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It should be added that contrary to common belief, the U</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> does have universal health care. It’s called “emergency rooms.” If you can drag yourself to one, they’ll take care of you, often with superb care — and often a hefty bill. It’s the most cruel and expensive form of universal care known, but at least it’s there.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bad as the situation was that Trump inherited, he has been committed to making it worse. One illustration of the commitments (and moral level) of the White House is the budget it submitted for the coming year on February 10, while the pandemic was raging. It called for still further cuts for the </span><span data-contrast="auto">CDC</span><span data-contrast="auto"> along with increased subsidies to the fossil fuel industries that are driving us to final catastrophe. And, </span><span data-contrast="auto">of course,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> more funding for the bloated military and for the famous </span><span data-contrast="auto">w</span><span data-contrast="auto">all that will protect us from the rapists and murderers surging across the border.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That barely skims the surface. Failed state? Four more years?</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Are the anti-lockdown protests, which Trump is openly encouraging, merely about the shutting down of the economy and quarantines?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have enough experience to see that virtually everything Trump does is about himself</span><span data-contrast="auto"> — t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he country and the world be damned. In this case, one can detect a strategy behind the ongoing circus. Trump has been casting about to find someone to blame for his crimes. After evoking the </span><span data-contrast="none">Yellow Peril</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and laboring to destroy the WHO, with grim effects, he’s pretty much run out of targets. A rational next step is to tell governors that it’s your business: the </span><span data-contrast="auto">f</span><span data-contrast="auto">ederal government, which has all the resources, can’t do anything for you. If anything goes wrong, it’s your fault, not mine. And if something happens to go right somewhere, it demonstrates what a stable genius I am, and will be trumpeted by Sean Hannity as the most brilliant decision in human history.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is similar to the strategy of saying one thing today and the opposite tomorrow, each echoed rapturously by </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Fox News</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> while the liberal press dutifully tots up the lies (20,000?). If you shoot arrows at random, some may hit the target. And if one does? I’m vindicated and the scam goes on. You can’t lose.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The governors’ ploy is about the same: enforce lockdown, open up the economy (and protect our “</span><span data-contrast="auto">Second</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Amendment rights,” which has nothing to do with anything but pushes the right buttons). If it makes life harder for the governors and leads to many deaths, that’s OK too. It’s all the fault of the urban centers where diseases and other maladies fester among those who are poisoning our lily</span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto">white society.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malevolent, but not stupid.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s tempting to add the injunction to the states by </span><span data-contrast="none">Mitch McConnell</span><span data-contrast="auto">, the real evil genius of the Republican organization. Go bankrupt. The Republican Senate is not going to compensate you for your foolish decision to give pensions to firefighters, teachers, policemen and other undeserving takers. We have to save the money for the makers, like the airline industries that need $50 billion because in the glory days of high profits, instead of improving services and building the enterprises, they spent close to $50 billion in buybacks to inflate stock prices and compensation for management. After all, first things first. There’s no need to elaborate. His vileness has been so egregious that there’s been plenty of commentary in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">mainstream</span> <span data-contrast="auto">press.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In defense of Trump, McConnell and rest of the merry gang, they are carrying to an extreme the only way of dealing with the dilemma that the Republicans have faced since they turned to pure service to the business world. It’s hard to go to voters and say, “Look, we’re the more extreme of the two business parties. We’re designing policies to benefit our primary constituency of great wealth and corporate power, and to throw you into the waste bin. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> vote for us.”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Somehow, that doesn’t work well. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it’s important to divert attention to “cultural issues,” to pretend to be adamantly</span><span data-contrast="auto"> opposed to</span> <span data-contrast="auto">abortion rights</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and love assault rifles, to be terrified of </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">them</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, to dismiss global warming as a Commie plot, and all the rest. The word “pretend” is quite appropriate, but I won’t go into that here.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Democratic establishment has its own sins to answer for, but it is nothing like this; more like the moderate Republicans of the days before the Gingrich-Hastert-McConnell era. And it is subject to popular pressures, which have moved the party considerably to the left in recent years. That’s not insignificant.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">World leaders’ approval rating has soared as a result of their handling of the coronavirus crisis, with the exception of Donald Trump. Could </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">c</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">oronavirus be the determinant element that will put an end to four years of a nightmarish scenario written, directed, produced and carried out by the most dangerous buffoon this country has had for president? Trump’s Waterloo, so to speak?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump benefited from the usual leadership bump when he finally acknowledged that the crisis was real, two months late, and assumed the proper presidential pose. His approval ratings have since receded to the norm from the beginning of his presidency. That’s a pretty impressive performance considering what he’s done to the country. I can’t guess where it will go from here. It’s really hard to say.</span> <span data-contrast="none">He’s damned resilient, and his voting base and media echo chamber stay loyal. Current statistics show that he seems to be back to his norm of approval, which hasn’t </span><span data-contrast="none">varied a great deal through his term. And if it looks bad, they might pull something before November. Like concocting an incident and bombing Iran.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why is Trump bent on destroying the U</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">S</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> Postal Service</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> (USPS)</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What does the postal service contribute to </span><span data-contrast="auto">private wealth and corporate </span><span data-contrast="auto">power</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (</span><span data-contrast="auto">Trump’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">primary constituency</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">? Essentially nothing. Just means that they have to pay taxes for rural mail service and other services for ordinary people — insofar </span><span data-contrast="auto">as </span><span data-contrast="auto">they pay taxes, another interesting topic that I’ll put aside. If the USPS is privatized, it can contribute to private wealth and corporate power, and they can run it “efficiently,” like the health care system.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A good deal more is involved. It’s important </span><span data-contrast="auto">to them </span><span data-contrast="auto">to drive out of people’s heads the idea that democracy might work, that a public system can serve the needs of the general public. In much of the country, the local post office not only serves people’s needs efficiently but is even a place where you can stop by and chat with a human being and meet your friends.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And — horror of horrors — activists might be able to help people realize why the postal service was set up by the founders. Its prime function in early years was to deliver journals and magazines cheaply, a subsidy to an independent press, what the founders seem to have had in mind in framing the First Amendment. These matters are explored in depth in scholarly work by </span>Robert McChesney<span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="none">Victor Pickard</span><span data-contrast="auto">, who carry the discussion right to the 20</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto"> century struggles to join the world in having vibrant public media, a critical matter for media activists today.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s dangerous turf. Better to destroy the virus of democracy before it infects too many people.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Joe Biden expressed the fear last week that Trump might attempt to delay the November 2020 election. Is this a likely scenario? Does the sitting president have the authority to do so on account of a national crisis?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No constitutional authority, but Trump is quite capable of imitating his ludicrous friend Jair </span><span data-contrast="auto">Bolsonaro</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and declaring “I am the Constitution.” Unlike the Brazilian judiciary, the Roberts </span><span data-contrast="auto">Supreme </span><span data-contrast="auto">Court might back </span><span data-contrast="auto">such a statement</span><span data-contrast="auto"> up. And if granted another four years of court-packing up and down the line with young ultra-right figures, virtually anything will be possible. Anything, that is, but mildly progressive measures. Their fate will be dim for a generation or more.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s also not beyond imagination that if Trump loses the electoral college (not just the popular vote), he’ll declare the election illegitimate, claiming that the Dem</span><span data-contrast="auto">ocrat</span><span data-contrast="auto">s brought in undocumented immigrants</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and insist on staying in office, surrounded by armed militias.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I can’t verify it, but it’s been credibly reported that if he has to leave the White House</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Trump may be facing serious charges brought by states’ attorneys. That aside, </span><span data-contrast="auto">given his mental state, Trump</span><span data-contrast="auto"> might not be able to handle defeat and walk away like a normal human being.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Many on the </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">l</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">eft feel, naturally, and with much justification, extremely uncomfortable about Joe Biden. In fact, we hear now from some quarters the same arguments we heard in 2016 about Hillary Clinton, which is to say that it would be unconscionable for progressives to accept the </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">“</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">lesser of two evils</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> principle. </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">How can we understand the political and conceptual context of electoral choices made by </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">progressives and the </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">l</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">eft in November 2020?</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These questions are plainly important. They are a matter of intense discussion and often impassioned debate on the left, and plenty of invective. That makes them worth discussing. To be quite frank, I don’t see much other reason for discussing them. I’ve tried to explain in recent interviews, and judging by the reactions, have failed. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I will repeat in more detail.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I’ve been around for a long time and can’t think of a candidate about whom I was not “extremely uncomfortable,” at least since FDR (and I was too young to have considered opinions then).</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Biden’s case it’s easy to think of reasons to be extremely uncomfortable. We can begin with his participation in the destruction of Libya and Honduras, in Obama’s global assassination campaign, in breaking all records in deportation — and on from there. But while continuing with constant efforts to change that world, we have to take off a few minutes to </span><span data-contrast="auto">each make our own choices </span><span data-contrast="auto">on election day.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">L</span><span data-contrast="auto">et’s think through the two concepts that lie behind the question: “unconscionable” and “lesser of two evils principle</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s start with “unconscionable.” There are those — including close personal friends and long-time activists whom I greatly respect — who take the position that some actions are simply “unconscionable,” whatever the consequences. I will ignore this position. To me, frankly, it seems not worth discussing. In the moral domain, what matters is the predictable consequences of your actions, those you </span><span data-contrast="auto">are well aware of but choose to ignore. No one cares if you feel your conscience is clear.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s turn to </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">lesser of two evils principle.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Throughout my lifetime of activism (almost 80 years), I’ve been familiar with two doctrines about voting. One is the official doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">fficial doctrine</span> <span data-contrast="auto">holds that politics consists of showing up every few years, pushing a lever, then going back to one’s private pursuits. Citizens are “spectators,” not “participants in action,” according to official doctrine. They can choose one or another member of the leadership class (“the responsible men”) but that’s the limit of popular participation. I happen to be quoting Walter Lippmann, </span><span data-contrast="auto">a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> respected public intellectual of the 20</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto"> century </span><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><span data-contrast="auto">a Wilson-FDR-JFK liberal</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in his “progressive essays in democracy,” but the ideas are representative of prevailing liberal opinion. They trace back to the </span><span data-contrast="auto">f</span><span data-contrast="auto">ramers of the Constitution. That’s why the “gold standard” in constitutional scholarship, a fine and illuminating study</span><span data-contrast="auto"> by </span><span data-contrast="auto">Michael Klarman, is called “</span><span data-contrast="none">The Framers’ Coup</span><span data-contrast="auto">” — a coup against the popular demand for democracy</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On the right, views are much harsher.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A second doctrine is the one that has always prevailed on the left, call it </span><span data-contrast="auto">“left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Politics consists in constant direct popular engagement in public affairs, including a wide variety of activism on many fronts. Occasionally a</span><span data-contrast="auto">n</span><span data-contrast="auto"> event comes up in the formal political arena called an “election.” For left activists, that requires spending a brief period assessing the options (a very brief period for legitimate activists, who’ve been following everything relevant closely). Then comes a decision as to whether it’s worthwhile to take a few minutes away from ongoing political work to push a lever in the quadrennial extravaganza. It’s at most a brief departure from political engagement.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s the doctrine that I’ve followed all my life, sometimes abstaining because the show didn’t seem to matter and there’s no point legitimizing the charade by participating, sometimes voting for a third party, sometimes voting for Jones if it’s important to block Smith. I’ve sometimes voted for a Republican, in years when the Republicans were still a bone fide political party and had a better candidate.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are, of course, myriad other cases, but the general point of </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> seems clear.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In recent years</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a third doctrine has made an appearance and is now consuming much debate on the left: </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">lesser of two evils principle. I’d never heard of it before, in a lifetime of intensive political engagement (in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sense). </span><span data-contrast="auto">And it seems quite strange to me. It obviously is quite different from </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto">, the prevailing doctrine on the left. The intensive debate about it falls within official doctrine, with its laser-like focus on the elections.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My own feeling about </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">lesser of two evils principle, of course, is that we should reject it in favor of </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It has no merits that I can see, so I think we can put it aside, along with the often</span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto">fevered debate about it.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s now consider the immediate case in hand</span><span data-contrast="auto">. If</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the traditional </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine were applied to the current situation, it would require</span><span data-contrast="auto"> comparing Trump and his entourage with Biden and his</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and ask</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> whether there is a difference between them.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto"> personally</span><span data-contrast="auto"> think the difference is colossal. First and decisive, another four years of Trump and we’ll have approached or possibly passed tipping points on the path toward environmental catastrophe toward which Trump is racing, his “party” in tow, virtually isolated in the world, certainly in the political system here. Just as important, the arms control regime will be dismantled, sharply increasing the threat of terminal war. The severe threats that Trump has incited in the Middle East will have increased, if not exploded. The Doomsday Clock, already reduced to seconds under Trump, will probably be close to abandoned. The reactionary international led by the White House that Trump is establishing will be well solidified. At home, the judiciary will be so packed by ultra-right young judges that no progressive initiatives will be able to be implemented for a generation. By the wayside we’ll be observing other horrors, like children sent to concentration camps on the border, </span><span data-contrast="auto">B</span><span data-contrast="auto">lack </span><span data-contrast="auto">people</span><span data-contrast="auto"> murdered on a whim, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An advocate of </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will spend a few minutes reviewing the familiar facts, then take off another few minutes to push a lever, then go back to work.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I know of only one proposed counterargument. We have to put pressure on the Democratic establishment. To begin with, it’s not a counterargument. It simply reiterates the main thesis of </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto">: constant pressure. The only remaining question is how to impose pressure. There are, basically, two proposals on the table. The first is </span><span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto">. The second is refusing to vote for Biden.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s take a look at these.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span> <span data-contrast="auto">left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto">. We continue with what has been done, and has been very effective. One illustration is the Sanders campaign, which has been a remarkable success in shifting debate and policy choices to the left. The activism of the Sunrise Movement</span><span data-contrast="auto"> —</span><span data-contrast="auto"> aided by young congresswomen brought to office in the Sanders wave, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</span><span data-contrast="auto"> —</span><span data-contrast="auto"> has brought to the legislative </span><span data-contrast="auto">agenda a Green New Deal, with the cooperation of liberal Democrat Ed Markey, </span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">enator from Massachusetts. Some version of a Green New Deal is essential for survival. There have also been significant shifts in other areas (health care, minimum wage, harsh repression in </span><span data-contrast="auto">vulnerable</span><span data-contrast="auto"> communities, women’s rights, on and on). We can, in fact, see this in Biden’s program, which is well to the left of previous Democratic front-runners. That’s why Biden is supported against Trump by Sanders (who had a large role in bring</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the shift about) and also by longtime labor activists like Lawrence </span><span data-contrast="auto">Mishel</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and Jared Bernstein. It’s not my program, or yours, but we can hardly doubt that it is an improvement over what preceded.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> efforts can work, as they often have before. We all know that that has been the main source of progress over the years, particularly when there were administrations susceptible to activist pressure.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It could be argued that political programs are just words. True, but irrelevant. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Left doctrine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> efforts can keep Biden’s feet to the fire, as has often happened in the past. And there will be opportunities to go far beyond, an urgent necessity.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In contrast, we can be sure that a Trump administration will be rock solid in opposition.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The second approach is to refuse to vote for Biden in the hope that withholding the vote will convince the Democratic establishment to take us seriously down the road. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I can’t honestly construct a plausible version of this view, and it would be unfair to try</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Turning finally to your question, “</span><span data-contrast="auto">How can we understand the political and conceptual context of electoral choices made by progressives and the left in November 2020?</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To me the answer seems clear. We should </span><span data-contrast="auto">assess whether there is meaningful </span><span data-contrast="auto">difference between </span><span data-contrast="auto">the candidates, and also recognize that, for most of us, voting takes</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a few minutes</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">hen </span><span data-contrast="auto">we </span><span data-contrast="auto">go back to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> our real activist</span><span data-contrast="auto"> work.</span></p>
