		<h1>I applaud your protest</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky interviewed by Gabriel Matthew Schivone</h2>
<h3><i><a href="http://wildcat.arizona.edu/opinions/i-applaud-your-protest-1.436185">Arizona Daily Wildcat</a></i>, September 8, 2009</h3>
<p>GS: What do you think of the levels of student activism today? I mean, we hear a lot about how, you know, &#8220;the students are more apathetic today, it&#8217;s not like the &#8217;60s,&#8221; etc. What have you observed in terms of student levels (of activism) today?</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: When people talk about &#8220;the &#8217;60s,&#8221; what they are thinking of is about two years. You know, 1968, 1969 &#8212; roughly. You know, a little bit before, a little bit later. And it&#8217;s true that student activism today is not like those two years. But, on the whole, I think it&#8217;s grown since the 1960s. So, take the feminist and the environmental movements &#8230; I mean, they&#8217;re from the &#8217;70s. Take the International Solidarity Movement &#8212; that&#8217;s from the &#8217;80s. Take the Global Justice Movement, which just had another huge meeting in Brazil. That&#8217;s from this century. Plenty of students are involved in these things. In fact, the total level of student involvement in various things is probably as huge as it&#8217;s ever been, except for maybe the very peak in the 1960s when the war was a huge issue. Or the Civil Rights Movement in the South that trained many students &#8212; that was the early &#8217;60s. It&#8217;s not what I would like it to be, but it&#8217;s far more than it&#8217;s been.</p>
<p>GS: Where do you think (of) these rumors about &#8220;passivity&#8221;? I think (the rumors are) an effort to induce passivity. In fact, the &#8212; you know, the standard picture of the &#8217;60s that&#8217;s presented is that it was a terrible time. It was what&#8217;s called &#8220;the time of troubles&#8221;. You know, students were going crazy, everything was falling apart, and so on. That&#8217;s not what was happening. What was happening &#8212; it was a time when the country was starting to become more civilized &#8212; thanks largely to the impetus of the activist students.</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: Well, you know, elite sectors and centers of power don&#8217;t like that lesson. They don&#8217;t want that lesson to be learned. They want students to be passive and apathetic. In fact, there was a pretty big backlash to the &#8217;60s. One of the reasons for the very sharp rise in tuition is to kind of capture students. You know, if you come out of college with a huge debt, you&#8217;re gonna have to work it off. I mean, you&#8217;re gonna have to become a corporate lawyer or go into business or something. And you won&#8217;t have time for engaged activism. The students of the &#8217;60s were &#8212; at that time, you know, the society, the culture was much more open. I mean, a student could take off a year or two and devote it to activism and think, &#8216;Okay, I&#8217;ll get back into my career later on.&#8217; Now, that&#8217;s much harder today. And not by accident. These are disciplinary techniques.</p>
