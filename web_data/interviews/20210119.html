<h2>An Interview with C.J. Polychroniou</h2>
<h3>January 19, 2021. <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/chomsky-coup-attempt-hit-closer-to-centers-of-power-than-hitlers-1923-putsch/">TruthOut</a>.</h3>
<p><span class="s2">Even a</span><span class="s2">s </span><span class="s2">the Biden administration takes the reins of power</span><span class="s2">, the </span><span class="s2">fact remains that</span><span class="s2"> authoritarianism and a </span><span class="s2">fascist strain</span><span class="s2"> of political thinking ha</span><span class="s2">ve</span><span class="s2"> taken firm roo</span><span class="s2">t</span><span class="s2"> on U.S. soil among a </span><span class="s2">large proportion</span><span class="s2"> of</span><span class="s2"> its</span><span class="s2"> citizens</span><span class="s2">. This </span><span class="s2">utterly disturbing development </span><span class="s2">will</span><span class="s2">, according to Noam Chomsky in </span><span class="s2">th</span><span class="s2">is</span><span class="s2"> exclusive interview for </span><em><span class="s4">Truthout</span></em><span class="s4">,</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s2">be hard to contain. </span><span class="s2">A recent poll shows that the overwhelming majority of Republicans continues to give </span><span class="s2">a </span><span class="s2">thumbs up to Donald Trump</span><span class="s2">,</span><span class="s2"> even after the storming of the Capitol. </span><span class="s2">I</span><span class="s2">n the wake of the attempted coup, and on the cusp of a new administration</span><span class="s2">, what do the current political currents</span><span class="s2"> mean for the future?</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s2">C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, y</span><span class="s2">ou ha</span><span class="s2">d</span><span class="s2"> been warning </span><span class="s2">all along </span><span class="s2">of a potential coup in the event that Trump would lose the 2020 election. </span><span class="s2">In th</span><span class="s2">is</span><span class="s2"> context, a</span><span class="s2">re you surprised </span><span class="s2">at all </span><span class="s2">by </span><span class="s2">w</span><span class="s2">hat took place on Capitol Hill on the </span></strong><span class="s2"><strong>Electoral College vote count?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s2">Noam Chomsky</span><span class="s2">: </span></strong><span class="s3">Surprised, yes.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">I’d expected a strong reaction from Trump’s voting base, raised to a fever pitch by his latest antics.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">But hadn’t expected </span><span class="s3">the attempted coup to reach </span><span class="s3">this level</span><span class="s3"> of violence</span><span class="s3">, and I suspect most of the participants didn’t either. Many seemed to have been caught up in the excitement of the moment when the leaders of the crowd surged into the hated Capitol to drive out the demons who were not just </span><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s3">stealing the election</span><span class="s3">”</span><span class="s3"> but </span><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s3">stealing</span><span class="s3">”</span><span class="s3"> their country from them</span><span class="s3">: their </span><span class="s3">w</span><span class="s3">hite Christian</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">country</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">That it was an attempted coup is not in question.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">It was openly and proudly </span><span class="s3">pro</span><span class="s3">claimed as just that</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">It was an attempt to overturn</span><span class="s3"> an elected government</span><span class="s3">. That</span><span class="s3">’s </span><span class="s3">a coup.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">True, what was attempted was not the kind of coup regularly backed by </span><span class="s3">Washington in its dependencies, a military takeover with ample bloodshed, torture, “disappearance.” But</span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s3"> nevertheless</span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">it was </span><span class="s3">an attempted coup.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">True, the perpetrators regarded themselves as defending the legitimate government, but that’s the norm, even for the most vicious and murderous coup</span><span class="s3">s</span><span class="s3">, like the U</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3">S</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3">-backed coup in Chile on the </span><span class="s5">first 9/11</span><span class="s3"> — </span><span class="s3">which was </span><span class="s3">actually much worse in virtually every dimension than the second one, </span><span class="s3">the one that</span><span class="s3"> we </span><span class="s3">remember and </span><span class="s3">commemorate.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The first one is best forgotten on the principle of “wrong agents”: </span><span class="s3">U</span><span class="s3">s, not some radical Islami</span><span class="s3">c </span><span class="s3">fundamentalists</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">The emotions </span><span class="s3">of those attempting the</span><span class="s3"> [Capitol]</span><span class="s3"> coup </span><span class="s3">were</span><span class="s3"> apparent.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Belief that the election was stolen w</span><span class="s3">as plainly</span><span class="s3"> held with real fervor.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">And</span><span class="s3"> it</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">is understandable </span><span class="s3">among people who live in passionate</span><span class="s3">ly</span><span class="s3"> pro-Trump areas</span><span class="s3"> where he is revered </span><span class="s3">as </span><span class="s3">their savior, and for some, </span><span class="s3">even </span><span class="s3">chosen by God, </span><span class="s5">as he </span><span class="s5">once </span><span class="s5">declared</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Many </span><span class="s3">may </span><span class="s3">scarcely </span><span class="s3">have </span><span class="s3">seen a Biden sign, or heard</span><span class="s3"> anything</span><span class="s3"> from <em>Fox News</em> or Rush Limbaugh </span><span class="s3">to suggest some possible flaw in their </span><span class="s3">beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">In </span><span class="s3">some respects</span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s3"> these beliefs are not as </span><span class="s3">bizarre</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">as they </span><span class="s3">may </span><span class="s3">look</span><span class="s3"> at first</span><span class="s3">. A shift of tens of thousands of votes in a few counties </span><span class="s3">might</span><span class="s3"> have swung the election the other way in a deeply undemocratic system</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">such as</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">ours</span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s3"> where 7 million votes can be swept aside </span><span class="s3">along with</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">an</span><span class="s3"> unknown number of others</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">eliminated by purging, gerrymandering, and </span><span class="s3">the </span><span class="s3">many other devices</span><span class="s3"> that have been devised</span><span class="s3"> to steal the election from the “wrong people</span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s3">”</span><span class="s3"> effectively authorized by the Supreme Court in its shameful 2013 decision nullifying the Voting Rights Act (</span><em><span class="s6">Shelby County v. Holder</span></em><span class="s3">).</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">As we’ve discussed before, the malevolent figure in charge deserves credit for his talent in tapping </span><span class="s3">the poison</span><span class="s3">ous streams</span><span class="s3"> that </span><span class="s3">run</span><span class="s3"> not far below the surface of American society, with sources that </span><span class="s3">are</span><span class="s3"> deep in</span><span class="s3"> U</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3">S</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> history and culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">I have to say that I was also surprised by the quick reaction of </span><span class="s3">those</span><span class="s3"> who own the country and </span><span class="s3">have a large share of </span><span class="s3">responsib</span><span class="s3">ility</span><span class="s3"> for the malaise that broke forth on January 6</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">I</span><span class="s3">n</span><span class="s3"> no small part, it is a consequence of the</span><span class="s3"> neoliberal assault since Reagan,</span><span class="s3"> amplified by his successors,</span><span class="s3"> that has devastated the rural areas that are the homes of many who stormed the Capitol.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Th</span><span class="s3">ose who hold the levers of the private power</span><span class="s3"> that dominates the society and political system</span><span class="s3"> never liked Trump’s </span><span class="s3">behavior</span><span class="s3">, which harmed the image they project as humanists dedicated to the common good.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">But they </span><span class="s3">were willing to tolerate the</span><span class="s3"> vulgar performance </span><span class="s3">as long as </span><span class="s3">Trump</span><span class="s3"> and his accomplices </span><span class="s3">delivered the goods, </span><span class="s3">lining their pockets by </span><span class="s3">robbing the public</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">And that they did.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The “</span><span class="s3">transfer of wealth</span><span class="s3">”</span><span class="s3"> from the lower 90</span><span class="s3"> percent</span><span class="s3"> to the ultra-rich </span><span class="s3">since Reagan opened the </span><span class="s3">doors for highway robbery</span><span class="s3"> reaches</span><span class="s3"> almost $50 trillion, according to a </span><span class="s5">recent </span><span class="s5">Rand corporation study</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> No</span><span class="s3"> one</span><span class="s3"> can place numbers on the vastly greater cost of environmental destruction that was a high priority of the Trump-McConnell years</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">of</span><span class="s3"> service to the very rich and corporate sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">But Jan</span><span class="s3">uary</span><span class="s3"> 6 was apparently too much, and the marching orders were delivered swiftly by the Big Guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">One has to have some sympathy for the legislators caught between</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">powerful contending forces.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">On the one hand, </span><span class="s3">they see </span><span class="s3">the angry hordes whipped to a frenzy by Trump’s performances, and still in his pocket, poised to wreak vengeance on those who betray their leader.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">And </span><span class="s3">on the other hand, </span><span class="s3">looking down on them from above,</span><span class="s3"> are</span><span class="s3"> the captains of finance and industry who fund their elections and dangle before them many other privileges</span><span class="s3"> to keep them in line</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> (</span><span class="s3">H</span><span class="s3">ow </span><span class="s3">many member</span><span class="s3">s</span><span class="s3"> of Congress leave office to become truck drivers or secretaries?)</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">The dilemma is particularly harsh for </span><span class="s3">s</span><span class="s3">enators, </span><span class="s3">who are </span><span class="s3">more reliant on the large donors.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">And the</span><span class="s3">ir</span><span class="s3"> defection from the ranks </span><span class="s3">of obsequious Trump loyalists has been </span><span class="s3">somewhat greater.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s2">Apparently, D</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s2">C</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s2"> Cou</span><span class="s2">ncil members had been briefed by the U</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s2">S</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s2"> Attorney for the District of Columbia that Donald Trump might invoke the Insurrection Act to seize control of the city police, but did not expect an attack on the Capitol itself.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s2">In your own view, what explains the </span><span class="s2">enormous security failures that led to the </span><span class="s2">C</span><span class="s2">apitol siege, </span><span class="s2">and </span><span class="s2">do the events of January 6, 2021, </span><span class="s2">qualify as a putsch?</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="s3">An attempted putsch, though the connotations of the term</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s7">putsch</span><span class="s3"> may be too strong. The events reminded many, including historians of fascism, of Hitler’s failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923</span><span class="s3">, which actually did not so easily penetrate the centers of power as the attempted coup of January 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">The reasons for the security failures are being debated. I have no special insight. </span><span class="s3">Black members of the Capitol police, who showed great courage along with many of their white colleagues, have charged for y</span><span class="s3">ea</span><span class="s3">rs that the force has been infiltrated with white supremacists.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">There may have been some collusion, and possibly serious corruption higher up the chain of command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s2">If Trump incited an insurrection against elected officials of the U.S. government, </span><span class="s2">is it enough that he </span><span class="s2">has</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s2">be</span><span class="s2">en</span><span class="s2"> impeached again? </span><span class="s2">S</span><span class="s2">houldn’t </span><span class="s2">h</span><span class="s2">e </span><span class="s2">b</span><span class="s2">e </span><span class="s2">facing </span><span class="s2">sedition charges since inciting an insurrection against the government is a criminal act under Title 18 of the U.S. Code?</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="s3">I presume the Joint Chiefs of Staff chose their words carefully in their </span><span class="s5">m</span><span class="s5">essage on the “violent riot”</span><span class="s3"> on January 6,</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s8">“a</span><span class="s9"> direct assault on the U.S. Congress, the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process</span><span class="s9">,” an act of “violence, sedition and insurrection.” They surely considered the fact that incitement to sedition and insurrection carries a heavy prison sentence.</span><span class="s9"> </span><span class="s9">I presume that they also weighed the evidence that such incitement took place from the Oval Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="s8">Many questions arise about how to pursue </span><span class="s3">such barely concealed charges, but we should be careful to avoid the Watergate trap.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The </span><span class="s3">Nixon </span><span class="s3">impeachment procedures were initiated by [Massachusetts] Rep. Robert Drinan, S.J.</span><span class="s3">, charging </span><span class="s3">him</span><span class="s3"> with the bombing of Cambodia, a truly monstrous crime</span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s3"> of Nuremberg Trial caliber.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">That charge was struck down by Congress.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The prime charge against Nixon was that he organized thugs to invade one of two seats of political power in the country, the Democratic Party headquarters. This attack on the foundations of the Republic was overcome in a “stunning vindication of our constitutional system” (famed liberal historian Henry Steele Commager).</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">In short, </span><span class="s3">the powerful can rise to their own defense.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The victims of truly monstrous crimes can look elsewhere for recourse.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Maybe history</span><span class="s3">, with luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">Incitement of an attempted coup is no laughing matter, but it scarcely weighs in the balance against a dedicated effort to destroy the environment that sustains life on Earth or demolition of the arms control regime that mitigates the threat of nuclear war.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s2">Do you </span><span class="s2">believe that Trump is finished as a political figure? Or, to </span><span class="s2">p</span><span class="s2">ut the question slightly differently, </span><span class="s2">was</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s2">the Washington putsch of January 6, 202</span><span class="s2">1</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s2">the </span><span class="s2">beginning of the </span><span class="s2">end of </span><span class="s2">the </span><span class="s2">rise of </span><span class="s2">Trump</span><span class="s2">ism</span><span class="s2">?</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="s3">Far from it.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Whether Trump will survive the error of judgment that turned major power centers against him is unclear.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">He may well</span><span class="s3"> do so</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The voting base of the Party seems to remain loyal, maybe with even greater fervor after this attack on their hero by the “deep state.” Local officials too.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">He was </span><span class="s3">cheered on his visit to </span><span class="s3">the Republican </span><span class="s3">N</span><span class="s3">ational </span><span class="s3">C</span><span class="s3">ommittee</span><span class="s3"> the day after the Capitol riot</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">He has other resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">Whatever the fate of the individual,</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Trumpism will not be</span><span class="s3"> so </span><span class="s3">easily contained.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">Its roots are deep</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The </span><span class="s3">anger and resentment</span><span class="s3"> raised to a frenzy by this talented con man is not limited to the U</span><span class="s3">.</span><span class="s3">S.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">The $50 trillion robbery is only the icing on the cake of the neoliberal disaster, which itself is built on foundations of deep injustice and repression.</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s3">We are not out of the woods, by far.</span></p>
