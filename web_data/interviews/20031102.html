		<h1>The Professorial Provocateur</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky interviewed by Deborah Solomon</h2>
<h3><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/magazine/02QUESTIONS.html?ex=1075093200&amp;en=bf7731407efe6331&amp;ei=5070" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>, November 2, 2003</h3>
<p><em>Your new book on American foreign policy, &#8221;Hegemony or Survival: America&#8217;s Quest for Global Dominance,&#8221; includes a blurb on the jacket that calls you &#8221;arguably the most important intellectual alive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like the intellectual label. In the academic world, most of the work that is done is clerical. A lot of the work done by professors is routine.</p>
<p><em>I assume you are not referring to your own efforts as a professor emeritus at M.I.T. and world-renowned linguist.</em></p>
<p>I have known people who are working class or craftsmen, who happen to be more intellectual than professors. If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory, you don&#8217;t have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives. But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works.</p>
<p><em>Your critiques of U.S. foreign policy have brought you a new following in the wake of 9/11 &#8212; you haven&#8217;t been this revered since the sit-ins and teach-ins during the Vietnam War. Do you see any connection between your work in linguistics and your work in radical politics?</em></p>
<p>I see virtually no connection.</p>
<p><em>But you must admit that politicians, much like you, earn their living with words and see language as the ultimate reality.</em></p>
<p>Language is a weapon of politicians, but language is a weapon in much of human affairs.</p>
<p><em>True. I&#8217;ve often wondered why there are more slang words for death and genitals than any other words.</em></p>
<p>Death and genitals are things that frighten people, and when people are frightened, they develop means of concealment and aggression. It is common sense.</p>
<p><em>Do you ever doubt your own ideas?</em></p>
<p>All the time. You should read what happens in linguistics. I keep changing what I said. Any person who is intellectually alive changes his ideas. If anyone at a university is teaching the same thing they were teaching five years ago, either the field is dead, or they haven&#8217;t been thinking.</p>
<p><em>But, unlike many reconstructed leftists, you have not changed your political views one iota since the 60&#8217;s. For instance, you have remained a vocal critic of Israel.</em></p>
<p>I objected to the founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don&#8217;t think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object to the United States as a Christian state.</p>
<p><em>Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew.</em></p>
<p>It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It&#8217;s grotesque. If an Italian criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?</p>
<p><em>Have you ever been psychoanalyzed?</em></p>
<p>I do not think psychoanalysis has a scientific basis. If we can&#8217;t explain why a cockroach decides to turn left, how can we explain why a human being decides to do something?</p>
<p><em>How would you explain your large ambition?</em></p>
<p>I am driven by many things. I know what some of them are. The misery that people suffer and the misery for which I share responsibility. That is agonizing. We live in a free society, and privilege confers responsibility.</p>
<p><em>If you feel so guilty, how can you justify living a bourgeois life and driving a nice car?</em></p>
<p>If I gave away my car, I would feel even <em>more</em> guilty. When I go to visit peasants in southern Colombia, they don&#8217;t want me to give up my car. They want me to help them. Suppose I gave up material things &#8212; my computer, my car and so on &#8212; and went to live on a hill in Montana where I grew my own food. Would that help anyone? No.</p>
<p><em>Have you considered leaving the United States permanently?</em></p>
<p>No. This is the best country in the world.</p>
