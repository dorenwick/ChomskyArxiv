		<h1>College</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky interviewed by Penn Jillette</h2>
<h3><i>Penn and Teller: Bullshit!</i>, May 30, 2005</h3>
<p>PENN (VO): But why would colleges want to use diversity and speech codes to minimize free speech?</p>
<p>HOROWITZ: When the left got into power, it closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>HOROWITZ (introducing himself): David Horowitz, Students for Academic Freedom.org.</p>
<p>PENN (VO): Get &#8217;em, Dave!</p>
<p>PENN (VO): Horowitz has made it his mission to take on universities that he believes infringe on students rights through a political agenda.</p>
<p>HOROWITZ: The university has been redefined from being an institution dedicated to the disinterested pursuit of knowledge to an institution for social change. That&#8217;s a definition of political party.</p>
<p>PENN: And which party? Well, it sure ain&#8217;t the libertarians, the Whigs, or the Cornbread-Sucking-Uncle-Tom Party. Who does that leave?</p>
<p>FLYNN: A lot of universities have served as sort of a training ground for leftists.</p>
<p>PENN (VO): [over shot of previous leftist interviewee] No!</p>
<p>FLYNN (introducing): Dan Flynn, author, Intellectual Morons</p>
<p>PENN (VO): According to Dan and a shitload of statistics, American academia is run by the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>FLYNN: If you look at the surveys done of the political affiliations of college professors, the Rocky Mountain News had it 31 to 1 Democrats to Republican at the University of Colorado. Similar surveys at Dartmouth, at Cornell it&#8217;s 25 to 1, at UNC Chapel Hill 10 Democrats to every 1 republican, Stanford 9 to 1. If you look at the history departments of these five schools combined, there were 137 Democrats and just 3 Republicans. The Kremlin was more diverse than that.</p>
<p>PENN (VO): [over shaky outside shot of the Stata Center] If we were going to find out why, we realized we had to go to the top, to the college professor considered by many to be the smartest man in</p>
<p>academia: Noam Chomsky. [shot of &#8220;32-D808: Department of Linguistics and Philosophy Headquarters&#8221; door] [shot of old news footage of Chomsky surrounded by reporters] Chomsky teaches linguistics at MIT, he&#8217;s a fawned-over cultural hero of the left, due to his protests of the Vietnam War and virtually every action of the United States since.</p>
<p>So at first reading, he sounds like someone we&#8217;d like! Vietnam was _way_ American bullshit.</p>
<p>[shot of man standing in front of a whiteboard in what might be Noam&#8217;s office] How the fuck do we get Noam Chomsky on our show? [Chomsky walks into the room, the door is shut behind him]</p>
<p>MAN: Hi, Professor Chomsky. [shakes hands]</p>
<p>PENN (VO): We told him we&#8217;d introduce him to Kirstie Alley. [shot of cameras and interview set up as Chomsky shakes another man&#8217;s hand] Smartest man in academia, my achin&#8217; ass. He fell for it! [Chomsky waves to camera]</p>
<p>MAN: So is there any validity to the claim by some that campuses have become bastions of leftist groupthink brainwashing?</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: [smiling] Campuses have become &#8212; what was the phrase? &#8212; campuses have become&#8230;</p>
<p>MAN: Bastions of leftwing groupthink brainwashing.</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: I suppose you can find maybe 2% of people on campus of whom that might be true.</p>
<p>PENN: 2%?! What the hell is Noam talking about? After all we&#8217;ve shown:</p>
<p>that Minnesota college, the statistics, and he admits to only 2%? 2% is the number of people who like peanut butter on their pizza. 2% is the number of people who wear Star Trek underwear. [looks at Teller, who nods] Chomsky wasn&#8217;t being upfront with us. And come to think of it, why would he be? Our show is called Bullshit! And he&#8217;s supposed to be the smartest man in academia. He can&#8217;t show his cards right away.</p>
<p>Better to keep everyone unsuspecting. Huh-huh, the slippery bastard.</p>
<p>PENN (VO): [over shot of Chomsky smiling broadly] Just look at him, wearing that crafty smile and that nonthreatening sweater. He&#8217;s ruthless, goddamnit! Good thing our crew packs heat.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>PENN (VO): Now it&#8217;s one thing to nail the dumbest guy in academia, but what about the man they call the smartest? Back at MIT, we asked Dr.</p>
<p>Chomsky about speech codes and the First Amendment.</p>
<p>PENN: He defends speech codes by citing the example of puting up a Nazi poster in your bedroom:</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: My freedom of speech doesn&#8217;t extend that far. And there&#8217;s something analogous that happens in a college. The kinds of speech, behavior, various actions that take place are entering into the home of the student.</p>
<p>PENN: Notice how he slipped in that word home.</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: It&#8217;s their home now. The college environment is _their home_.</p>
<p>PENN: Noam would be right if the college was 100% private. But the ones we&#8217;re talking about just aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>MAN: What do you think of Erica Halverson?</p>
<p>CHOMSKY: Don&#8217;t know who it is.</p>
<p>PENN (VO): Your loss, Noam. [shot of Erica Halverson, a girl-on-the-street from early in the show, dancing]</p>
