		<h1>Noam Chomsky: Trump isn&#8217;t really a nationalist</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky Interviewed by Steven Nelson</h2>
<h3>October 24, 2018. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/donald-trump?source=%2Fnews%2Fwhite-house%2Fnoam-chomsky-trump-isnt-really-a-nationalist">Washington Examiner</a>.</h3>
<p><span class="ArticlePage-articleBody-firstLetter">L</span>eft-wing academic Noam Chomsky says President Trump is not a “nationalist&#8221; because Trump doesn&#8217;t care enough about his own nation, regardless of Trump&#8217;s controversial embrace of the term this week.</p>
<p>Chomsky told the <i>Washington Examiner</i> the term is used in &#8220;all sorts of ways.&#8221; But while the term has been used to describe world leaders such as Adolf Hitler, the linguist and social analyst said he&#8217;s less concerned about that connotation and more irked by the falsity of Trump&#8217;s claim.</p>
<p>“I do object to the term for different reasons,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A nationalist is someone who is concerned for the state of the nation, which is far from true in Trump&#8217;s case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump called himself a nationalist on a Texas campaign stage Monday and repeated the assertion Tuesday, dusting off a term commonly used for the socially repressive, war-starting Axis governments in World War II.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of our country, and I am a nationalist,&#8221; Trump said in the Oval Office. &#8220;We have to take care of our country. We cannot continue to allow ourselves to be duped on military and also duped on trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chomsky, the 89-year-old advocate of libertarian socialism, has criticized Trump&#8217;s policies and temperament, calling him an &#8220;ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac.&#8221; But he also rebuked anti-fascism activists for lacking respect for free speech and inadvertently being “ a major gift to the Right.”</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor emeritus, who teaches part time at the University of Arizona, isn’t the first commentator to scoff at Trump’s new self-identifier. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said during a CNN appearance on Wednesday that “he’s not a nationalist.”</p>
<p>“He’s saying that he’s a nationalist because he wants you to be upset about it, but he’s really not a nationalist,” Scaramucci said.</p>
<p>John Bachtell, chairman of the Communist Party USA, said that he is concerned about Trump&#8217;s &#8220;ominous&#8221; rebranding, however, saying it&#8217;s part of &#8220;a dangerous mix and the stuff of fascism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trump is telling his base: America is the victim and under seize from foreigners of color,&#8221; Bachtell told the <i>Washington Examiner</i>. &#8220;His attacks are replete with lies, fear and scapegoating. He declares himself a nationalist fighting globalists, a term loaded with anti-Semitism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trump&#8217;s use of the term is ominous when connected to his other politics: authoritarianism, white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-communism. The content is white, Christian nationalism,&#8221; said the Communist leader, who endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton against Trump in the 2016 election.</p>
