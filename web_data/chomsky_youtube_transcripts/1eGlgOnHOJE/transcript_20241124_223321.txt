[Applause]
it is such a great honor thank you
Ambassador such a great honor to
introduce Professor Nome chsky today as
the Ambassador said he needs no intr
uction that's true but what an
opportunity to talk about such an
important figure in politics and
Linguistics
activism and most importantly a man of
compassion gome Chomsky has been The
Institute professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for over half half a century
beloved and revered by his
students but he has taught so many more
all over the world through his more than
100 books his tireless
speaking all over the world as he is
honored and honors so many by going to
find out what's happening on the ground
with his own
eyes a few years ago when he attempted
with his daughter Professor Avi chamski
to go into the Palestinian territories
unfortunately he was turned back by the
Israeli military but that hasn't stopped
him for so many decades for conveying to
the world what is happening
there
gome Chomsky wrote in
1974 the book peace in the Middle East
with a question mark at the
end in
1983 the seminal work fateful triangle
the United States Israel and the
Palestinians it is informed so many
people for so long Professor Chomsky not
only Tau talks about the facts on the
ground but has to
deconstruct especially in the United
States how the media covers the Israel
Palestine
conflict and then describe a very
different
reality sadly in the United States I can
say this is a journalist and a citizen
here while we don't have state media
that's a good thing you have to ask if
we did have state media how would it be
any
different it is a testament to all that
gnome has done that this event today had
to be moved from eoso because it simply
wasn't large enough into the UN General
Assembly and as we walked over here
seeing the
tapestry of gica the painting by Pablo
Picasso drawn in a frenzy 21 days and
Exile as his beloved city was bombed the
power of that painting and that tapestry
reproduction is that it shows the agony
of War etched into the faces of the
humans and the
animals that is what know chsky has
taught us never turns his laser focus
from you know in the 1970s he was
speaking out against the war in Vietnam
in
1967 he wrote an essay in the New York
Review of Books titled the
responsibility of
intellectuals
about the US involvement in Vietnam and
I I think those words
responsibility and
intellectual describe clearly gome
Chomsky his wife had to get a job go
back to school because they were trying
to prepare for the possibility that
gnome this revered Professor would end
up in jail for many years as he engaged
in nonviolent Civil Disobedience against
that war and I remember being here at
the United Nations the day that the
people of East teamour voted for their
freedom it was no Chomsky who for
decades never let anyone anywhere he
spoke or in almost any book he wrote
about forget
the pain of the people of East teamour
he educated me my colleague journalist
Alan narn as we went to East teamour to
cover what was taking
place and I remember calling him May
20th 2002 when we were doing a global BL
broadcast from East teamour the day the
people of East teamour celebrated their
freedom and asking if he ever thought
that day would come the man who outside
of teamour perhaps educated more people
about what was happening there he
actually said no he didn't think it was
possible and that's the power of gome
Chomsky even if he doesn't think
something is possible he never gives up
never lets us
forget whether we're talking about
teamour Vietnam taking testimony of
laian victims with the late Fred bramman
in LA or on the issue of Israel and
Palestine one of his more recent books
on Israel and Palestine Gaza in crisis W
written with Professor Elan Pape he
doesn't stop and Manufacturing consent
which taught us so much about how the
media manufactures consent for war the
New York Times described n Chomsky as
arguably the most important intellectual
alive today to which Professor Chomsky
responded what did I do
wrong that is his power his humor his
compassion and his passionate struggle
to ensure that people have
information about the reality on the
ground today talking about what's
happening in Israel and Palestine
Professor Nome
chsky
[Music]
thank you very much it's a pleasure to
be here to be able to talk with you and
discuss with you
afterwards uh many of the world's
problems are so
intractable that it's hard to think of
ways even to take steps towards
mitigating them uh the Israel Palestine
conflict is not one of these on the
contrary the general outlines of a
diplomatic solution have been clear for
at least least 40 years not the end of
the road nothing ever is but a
significant step forward and the
obstacles to a resolution uh are also
quite
clear the basic outlines were presented
here in a resolution brought to the UN
Security Council in January
1976 it called for a two-state
settlement on the internationally
recognized border and now I'm quoting
with guarantees for the rights of both
states to exist in peace and security
within secure and recognized
borders the resolution was brought by
the three major Arab states uh Egypt
Jordan
Syria sometimes called the confrontation
state
uh Israel refused to attend the session
the resolution was vetoed by the United
States uh a US veto typically is a
double
veto The veto the uh resolution is not
implemented and the event is vetoed from
history so you have to look hard to find
the record but it is there uh that has
said set the pattern that has continued
since the most recent us veto was in
February
2011 that's President Obama uh when uh
his administration vetoed a resolution
calling for implementation of official
US policy uh opposition to expansion of
settlements and it's worth bearing in
mind that expansion of settlements is
not really the issue it's the
settlements unquestionably illegal along
with the infrastructure projects
supporting them for a long time there
has been an overwhelming International
consensus in support of a settlement
along these General lines the pattern
that was set in January
1976 continues to the present Israel
rejects a settlement of these terms and
for many years has been devoting
extensive resources to ensuring that it
will not be
implemented with the unremitting and
decisive support of the United States
military economic
diplomatic and indeed
ideological by
establishing how the conflict is viewed
and interpet red in the United States
and within its broad sphere of
influence there's no time here to review
the record but its General character is
revealed by a look at what has happened
in Gaza in the past decade carrying
forward a long history of earlier
crimes uh last August August
26th a ceasefire was reached between
Israel and the Palestinian
Authority and the question on all our
minds is what are the prospects for the
future well one reasonable way to try to
answer that question is to look at the
record and here too there is a definite
pattern uh ceasefire is reached Israel
disregards it and continues its steady
assault on Gaza including continued
Siege intermittent acts of violence more
settlement and development projects
often violence in the West
Bank Hamas observes the ceas fire as
Israel officially
recognizes until some Israeli escalation
elicits aamas response which leads to
another exercise of
mowing the lawn in Israeli parlons uh
each episode more Fierce and destructive
than the
last the first of the series was the
agreement on movement and access in
November
2005 I'll give a close paraphrase of it
it called for a Crossing between Gaza
and Egypt at Rafa for the export of
goods and the transit of
people continuous operation of Crossings
between Israel and Gaza for the Import
and Export of goods and the transit of
people reduction of obstacles to
movement within the West Bank bus and
truck convoys between the West Bank and
Gaza the building of a sea port in Gaza
the reopening of the airport in Gaza AA
that Israel had recently
destroyed these are essentially the
terms of successive
ceasefires including the one just
reached a few weeks
ago uh the timing of the November
2005 uh agreement is significant uh this
was the moment of uh Israel's
disengagement as it's called from Gaz
the removal of several thousand Israeli
settlers from
Gaza this is depicted as a noble effort
to seek peace and development but the
reality is rather
different the uh the reality was
described very quickly by the Israeli
official who was in charge of
negotiating and implementing the
ceasefire though Vice glass close
confident of then prime minister Ariel
Chiron as he explained to the Israel
press the goal of the disengagement I'm
quoting him was the freezing of the
peace process so as to prevent the
establishment of a Palestinian State and
to ensure that diplomacy has been
removed indefinitely from our
agenda the reality on the ground is
described by Israel's leading
Specialists on the
occupation uh historian respected
historian idit zaral Israel's leading
diplomatic correspondent Akiva elar
wrote the major book The Standard work
on the settlement
project uh called Lords of the land
referring to the settlers what they say
about the disengagement is this this
they say the ruined territory and by
then it was ruined largely part of the
reason for the removal of the settlers
the renew Reen ruined territory was not
released for even a single day from
Israel's military grip or from the price
of the occupation that the inhabitants
pay every
day after the disengagement Israel Left
Behind scorched Earth devastated
services and people with neither a
present nor a future the settlements
were destroyed in an ungenerous move by
an unenlightened occupier which in fact
continues to control the territory and
to kill and harass its inhabitants by
means of its formidable military
might that's an accurate description
from the most respected source Israeli
Source uh the Oslo Accords 20 years ago
uh established that Gaza and the West
Bank are an indivisible territorial
Unity whose Integrity can not be broken
up for 20 years the United States and
Israel have been dedicated to separate
Gaza and the West Bank in violation of
the Accords that they had
accepted and a look at the map explains
why Gaza offers the only access to the
outside world of Palestine if Gaza is
separated from the West Bank whatever
autonomy might ultimately be granted in
the West Bank would be
imprisoned Israel on one side a hostile
Jordan Ally of Israel on the other side
and in addition uh one of Israel's slow
and steady us backed policies is to take
over the Jordan Valley about a third of
the West Bank much of the arable land uh
which would essentially imprison the
rest even more more tightly if Gaza is
separated from the West Bank that's the
major geostrategic reason for the
Israeli insistence with us backing on
separating the two in violation of the
Oslo agreements and the series of
ceasefires that have been reached since
November
2005 well the November 2005 agreement
lasted for a few weeks in January 20
2006 a very important event took place
the First full free election in the Arab
world carefully monitored recognized to
be free and fair it had one
flaw uh came out the wrong way uh you
must Hamas won the parliament control of
the parliament us and Israel didn't want
that uh you may recall at that period uh
the slogan on everyone's lips was
democracy promotion the highest us
commitment in the world was democracy
promotion here was a good test democracy
election came out the wrong way the US
instantly decided along with Israel to
punish the Palestinians for the crime of
voting the wrong way a harsh Siege was
instituted other
punishments uh violence increased the
United States immediately began to
organize a military coup to overthrow
the unacceptable government that's quite
familiar practice I won't go through the
record uh the European Union to its
shame and discredit and went along with
this uh there was an immediate Israeli
escalation that was the end of the
November agreement followed by Major
Israeli
onslaughts in 2007 a year later Hamas
committed even a greater crime than
winning a fair election it preempted the
planned military coup and took over the
Gaza that's described in the west in the
United States most of the West as
hamas's taking over Gaza by force which
is not false but something is omitted
the force was preemptive ing a planned
military coup to overthrow the elected
government that was a serious crime it's
bad enough to vote the wrong way in a
free election at the preempt a US
planned military coup is far more
serious the attack on Gaza increased
substantially at that point major
Israeli
onslaughts finally in January January
2008 another ceasefire was reached
terms were pretty much the same as those
that I quoted uh Israel publicly
rejected the cease fire said that it
would not abide by it Hamas observed the
ceasefire as Israel officially
recognizes despite Israel's refusal to
do so that continued until November 4th
2008 on November 4th which was the day
of the US election Israeli forces
invaded Gaza killed half a dozen Hamas
militants that led to a uh to Kasam
Rockets attacking Israel huge Israeli
response lots of killings all
Palestinians as usual uh in the end of
by the end of December couple of weeks
later Hamas offered to renew the
ceasefire
the Israeli cabinet considered it
rejected it this was a doish cabinet led
by aut om rejected it and decided to
launch the next major military operation
that was cast Le
which was a horrible operation so much
so that it caused an very
substantial International reaction
investigations by uh United Nations
commission Amnesty International Human
Rights Watch uh in the middle of the
this assault that the assault
incidentally was carefully timed to end
uh immediately before President Obama's
Inauguration he had already been elected
but he wasn't inaugurated yet so when he
was asked to comment on the ongoing
atrocities he responded by saying that
he couldn't do so the United States has
only one president and he wasn't
president yet he was talking about lots
of other things but not this uh the
attack was timed to end immediately
before the
inauguration so he therefore could
respond to the questions by saying well
now's not the time to look at the past
let's look forward to the future uh
diplomats know very well that that's a
standard slogan for those who are
engaged in serious crime let's forget
about the past let's look forward to a
glorious future well that was uh uh in
right in the middle of the assault uh
the security Council did pass a
resolution unanimously us abstaining
calling for an immediate
ceasefire with the usual terms that was
January 8th
2009 it was never observed and it broke
down completely with the next major
episode of mowing the lawn in November
2012 you can get a good sense of what
was going on by looking at the casualty
figures for the year
2012 uh 79 people were killed 78 of them
Palestinians the usual
story uh after the November assault
there was a ceasefire reached with the
usual terms I'll describe what happened
next by quoting a leading specialist
Nathan thr he's a leading Middle East
analyst for the international crisis
group as he writes Israel recognized
that Hamas was observing the terms of
the
ceasefire and therefore saw little
incentive in doing the same the military
attacks on Gaza increased along with
more stringent restrictions on
Imports exports were blocked e exit
permits were blocked continued until
that continued until April
2014 when Palestinians committed another
crime Gaza based Hamas and West Bank
based Palestinian Authority signed a
Unity agreement Israel Israel was
infuriated infuriated even more when the
world mostly supported it even the
United States gave weak but actual
support uh several reasons for the
Israeli reaction one is that Unity
between Gaza and the West Bank between
the two movements would threaten the
longstanding policies of separating the
two for the reasons that I
mentioned another reason was that a
Unity government undermines one of the
pretexts for Israel's refusal to
participate in negotiations seriously
namely how can we negotiate with uh an
entity that is internally divided well
if they're unified that pretext
disappears Israel was infuriated it
launched major assaults on the
Palestinians in the West Bank primarily
targeting Hamas hundreds of people
arrested mostly Hamas members also Gaza
also
killings uh there was a pretext of
course there always is the pretext was
that three s uh teenagers Israeli
teenagers in the settlements had been
brutally murdered captured and murder uh
Israel claimed officially that they
thought that they were alive so
therefore launched a long several weeks
uh assault in the West Bank uh alleging
that they were trying to find them alive
meanwhile the arrests attacks and so on
it turns out that they knew immediately
that they had been killed they also knew
immediately that it was very unlikely
that Hamas was involved the government
said they had certain knowledge that
Hamas had done it but their own leading
Specialists like schl drui had pointed
out right away that the assault which
was a brutal crime was very likely
committed by members of a breakaway Clan
Cosmic clan in uh heon Heron which was
not given a green light by Hamas and had
been a thorn in their sides uh and that
apparently is true if you look at the
later arrests and punishments anyway
that was a pretext for this assault uh
killings in gazit too that finally
elicited a Hamas response then came
operation protective Edge uh the one
which was just completed it more brutal
and destructive even the ones that
preceded it the pattern is very clear
and so far at least it appears to be
continuing uh the latest ceasefire was
reached on August 26th it was followed
At Once by Israel's greatest land grab
in 30 years almost a thousand acres in
the gitan area near what's called
Jerusalem greater Jerusalem about five
times the size of anything that
Jerusalem ever was taken over by Israel
annexed in violation of Security Council
orders uh the US State Department
informed the Israeli Embassy that
Israeli I'm quoting it now Israeli
activity in gush etun undermines
American efforts to protect Israel at
the United Nations and urged that Israel
shouldn't provide ammunition for those
at the United Nations who would
interpret Israel's position as
hardening uh actually that warning was
given 47 years ago in September
1967 at the time of Israel's first
colonization illegal colonization of git
yon Israeli historian gersam gorenberg
recently reminded us of this little has
changed since in the last 47 years apart
from the scale of the crimes which
continue without a
break uh with
constant us support well as for the
prospects there is a conventional P
picture it's repeated constantly on all
sides Israel Palestine independent
commentators
diplomats uh the picture that's
presented is that there are two
Alternatives either the two-state
settlement which represents an
overwhelming International consensus is
virtually everyone and if that fails uh
there'll have to be one state Israel
will take over the West Bank the
Palestinians will hand over the keys as
it's sometimes said Palestinians often
have favored that they say then they'll
be able to carry out a civil rights
struggle maybe moded modeled on the anti
aparte struggle in uh uh a in South
Africa fight for civil rights Within the
whole one state controlled by Israel
Israelis criticize that on the grounds
of what is called the demog the
demographic problem the fact that there
will be too many non-jews in a Jewish
state in fact pretty soon a
majority those are the Alternatives that
are presented overwhelmingly hardly an
exception my own opinion which I've
written about repeatedly without
convincing many people apparently but
I'll try to convince you is that this is
a total illusion those are not the two
Alternatives the there are two
Alternatives but they're different ones
one alternative is the international
consensus on a two-state
settlement basically the terms of
January
1976 uh by now it's virtually everyone
uh the Arab League the organization of
Islamic States includes Iran Europe
Latin America a formal at least about
everyone uh that's one option the other
option the realistic one is that Israel
will continue doing exactly what it is
doing right now before our eyes it's
visible with us support which is also
visible and what's happening is not a
secret you can open the newspapers and
read it Israel is taking over what they
call Jerusalem as I mentioned a huge
area maybe five times the area of
historic Jerusalem greater Jerusalem big
area in the West Bank includes uh many
our Villages being dispossessed
destroyed bringing settlers in all of
this is doubly illegal all the
settlements are illegal as determined by
the security Council advisory opinion of
the international court of justice uh
but the Jerusalem settlements are doubly
illegal because they are also in
violation of explicit Security Council
orders going back to
1968 with the US actually voting for
them at that time barring any change in
the status of Jerusalem but it continues
that's greater
Jerusalem uh there are then corridors
extending to the east one major Corridor
extending from Jerusalem almost to
Jericho virtually bisecting the West
Bank uh includes the Israeli town of ma
alumim which was built largely during
the Clinton Administration Clinton years
with the obvious purpose of bisecting
the West Bank doesn't still a little
contested territory but that's the goal
uh there's another Corridor further to
the north
including the town of
Ariel partially bisecting what remains
another one further to the north
including the town of Kim uh if you look
at the map these essentially break up
the West Bank into pretty much canons it
looks from a map as though a large
territory is left but that's misleading
most of that is uninhabitable Desert and
that's separate from what I mentioned
before the slow steady takeover of the
Jordan Valley to the east uh again about
a third of the Arab land country uh
Israel has no official policy of taking
it over but they're pursuing the policy
in the way that has been carried out now
for hundred years literally small steps
so nobody notices or at least people
pretend not to notice establish a
military zone uh the Palestinians who
live there have to be displaced because
it's a military zone no settlement
allowed and pretty soon there's a
military settlement Nal settlement or
another then sooner or later it becomes
an actual settlement meanwhile dig Wells
uh dispossess the
population set up green zones large
variety of techniques which have by now
reduced the PO the Arab population from
about 600,000 300,000 in
1967 to roughly 60,000 today as I
mentioned that essentially imprisons
what's left I don't think Israel has any
intention of taking over the Palestinian
population concentrations which are left
out of this uh these plans uh there are
analogies often made to South Africa but
they're quite misleading South Africa
relied on its black population
that was 85% of the population it was
its Workforce and they had to sustain
them just like slave owners have to
maintain their Capital they tried to
sustain the population they even tried
to gain international support for the
banto stands Israel has no such attitude
toward the Palestinians they don't want
to have anything to do with them if they
leave that's fine if they die that's
fine uh in standard
neocolonial p uh
pattern Israel is establishing
permitting the establishment of a center
for Palestinian Elites in rala where we
have nice restaurants and theaters and
so on every third world country under
the colonial system had something like
that that's the picture that's emerging
it's taking shape before our eyes uh it
has so far worked very well uh if it
continues Israel will not face a
demographic problem
when these regions are integrated slowly
into Israel uh actually the proportion
of Jews in Greater Israel will increase
there are very few Palestinians there
those who are there are being dis
dispossessed kicked out that's what's
taking shape before our eyes I think
that's the realistic alternative to a St
State settlement and uh there's every
reason to expect it to continue as as
long as the United States supports it
thank
[Applause]
you I will be asking professor a few
questions and then we'll open it up um
to the audience so I hope you'll prepare
your
questions Professor Chomsky we're here
at the United Nations General Assembly
what do you think is the single most
important action the UN can take to
solve the crisis in the occupied
territories between the Palestinians and
the
Israelis well we have to bear in mind
what all of you know in the real world
the United Nations can act in so far as
the great Powers permit it to act and in
this case that means primarily the
United States its close Ally Britain U
France those are the main actors and
they set pretty strict limits but within
those limits there are things that the
United Nations could do uh recognizing
the state of Palestine is a step forward
already about I think over
130 members of the United Nations have
taken that step
individually just recently U there was
the first break in Europe Sweden
announced that they would take that step
just couple of days ago the British
Parliament uh voted uh to recognize
Palestine bear in mind that that was
that the governing Tory party uh
basically boycotted the election at the
request of the Israeli government which
wanted the vote ignored so it's not a
policy change but it's a significant
symbolic move France has indicated that
they might move in that direction I
think these would be important steps uh
further steps that could be taken I
think are
to go beyond what has already partially
been done so the European Union in an
important
move did um
uh produce a directive calling on member
states to avoid any dealings with
Israeli institutions that have anything
to do with the occupation which they
correctly regard as illegal so in short
don't participate in criminal acts
that's not an extreme position uh that
can be done uh several major Church
groups in the United States
Presbyterians United Church the Church
of Christ have taken similar positions
also directing themselves against
multinationals which are involved in any
way in the occupied territories there is
a major boycott being undertaken by
Major investors of the security firms
the international security firms which
operate in the occupied territories and
many other places uh all of this could
be moved forward to a uh United Nations
resolutions possibly even this should be
at least tried in the security Council
if there's a US veto that's important
too brings forward what's actually
happening uh all of these are steps that
can be undertaken with a recognition
that the range of action at the United
Nations is of course circumscribed by
great power politics what do you think
what do you think what do you think is
the most the single most important
action the United States can take and
what about its role over the years what
is its interest here well one important
action that the United States could take
is to live up to its own laws of course
it would be nice if it lived up to
international law but maybe that's too
much to ask but live up to its own laws
uh the
uh and there there are several and here
incidentally I have in mind advice to
activists also who I think ought to be
organizing and educating in this
direction
there are two crucial cases one of them
is the What's called the Ley law Patrick
Le Senator Le introduced legislation
called the Le law which bars uh sending
weapons to any military units which are
involved in consistent human rights
violations there isn't the slightest
doubt that the Israeli Army is involved
in massive human rights violations
which means that all dispatch of us arms
to Israel is in violation of US law I
think that's
significant uh the US should be called
upon by its own citizens to and by
others to adhere to US law which also
happens to conform to international law
in this case as amnesty interational for
example for years has been calling for
an arms embargo against Israel for for
this reason these are all steps that can
be taken the second uh is the tax exempt
status that is given to organizations in
the United States which are directly
involved in the occupation and in
significant
uh attacks on human and civil rights
within Israel itself like the Jewish
National Fund take a look at its Charter
with the state of Israel uh which uh
commits it to acting for the benefit of
people of Jewish race religion and
origin within Israel one of the
consequences of that is that by a
complex array of uh laws and
administrative practices the fund pretty
much administers about 90% of the land
of the country with real consequences
for who can live places they get tax
exempt status also for their activities
in the West Bank which are strictly
criminal I think that's also straight in
violation of US law those are important
things and I think the US should be
pressured uh internationally and
domestically to abandon its virtual
unique role unilateral role in blocking
a political settlement for the past 40
years ever since the first veto in
January
1976 that should be a major issue in the
media in convocations like this in the
United Nations and domestic politics and
government politics and so
on the
role the role of the media can you talk
about that in particularly in the United
States and do you think that the opinion
in the United States public opinion is
shifting on this
issue well the role of the media are
somewhat shifting from uniform support
for virtually everything that Israel
does to and of course Silence about the
US role that's not just in the case of
Israel that's innumerable other cases as
well uh but uh slowly shifting but
nevertheless went about to say operation
protective Edge one can read in news
reporting news reporting in the New York
Times major journal uh a criticism of
hamas's assault on Israel during
protective Edge hamas's assault on
Israel not exactly what happened but
that's what people are reading and
that's the way it's depicted Israel is
uh over and over it's pointed out look
poor Israel is under attack it has the
right of self-defense everyone agrees to
that actually I agree too everyone has a
right of self-defense but that's not the
question the question is do you have a
right of self-defense by force by
violence the answer is no for anyone
whether it's an individual or a state
unless you have exhausted people
peaceful means if you won't even permit
peaceful means which is the case here
then you have no right of self-defense
by violence but try to find a word about
that in the media all you find is
self-defense uh when President
Obama rarely says anything about what's
happening it's usually uh if my
daughters were being attacked by Rockets
I would do anything to stop it he's
referring not to the Palestinian many
hundreds of Palestinian children who are
being killed and slaughtered but to the
children in the Israeli town of stot
which are which is under attack by kasum
missiles and remember that Israel knows
exactly how to stop those missiles
namely live up to a cease fire for the
first
time and then they would stop as in the
past even when Israel didn't live up to
a
ceasefire that framework and of course
the frame the the rest of the framework
is the United States is an honest broker
trying hard to bring the two recal and
sides together doing its best in this
Noble Endeavor has nothing to do with
the case the US is as some of the US
negotiators have occasionally
acknowledged Israel's lawyer uh if there
were serious negotiations going
on uh they would would be led by some
neutral party that may be Brazil which
has some International respect and they
would bring together the two sides on
the one side Israel and the United
States on the other side the
Palestinians those would be possible
realistic negotiations but the chances
of anyone in the
media either I won't even say pointing
it out even thinking about it is
minuscule the indoctrination is so deep
that really Elementary facts like these
and they are Elementary are almost
incomprehensible but to get back to your
the last point you mentioned it's very
important opinion in the United States
is Shifting not as fast as in most of
the world not as fast as in Europe it's
not reaching the point where you could
get a vote in Congress anything like
that the British Parliament a couple
days ago but it is changing mostly among
younger people and changing
substantially I'll just illustrate with
personal experience Amy has the same
experience um until pretty
recently when I gave talks on these
topics as I've been doing for 40 years I
literally had to have police protection
even at my own University MIT police
would insist on walking me back to my
car because of threats they picked up uh
meetings were broken up and so on that's
all gone just a couple of days ago I had
a talk on these topics at MIT uh meeting
wasn't broken up no police protection
maybe five or 600 students were there
all enthusiastic engaged committed
concerned wanting to do something about
it that's happening all over the country
uh all over the country Palestinian
solidarity is one of the biggest issues
on campus enormous change in the last
few years that's the way things tend to
change it often starts with younger
people gradually it gets to the rest of
the population uh efforts of the kind I
mentioned say trying to get the United
States government to live up to its own
laws those could be undertaken on a
substantial scale domestically and with
support from intern National
institutions and that could lead to
further changes I think that the for
example the two things that I mentioned
would have a considerable appeal to much
of the American public why should they
be funding military units that are
carrying out massive human rights
violations why should they be uh
permitting a tax exemption meaning we
pay for it that's what a tax exemption
means uh why should we be paying
compelled to pay for for violations of
fundamental human rights in another
country and even in occupied territories
where it's criminal I think that can
appeal to the American population and
can lead to the kinds of changes we've
seen in other
cases Nome if you were writing uh a
reader's guide to accompany um The New
York Times and its coverage of Israel
and Palestine what advice would you
give
I would tell them to watch democracy
now and that that wasn't pre-planned
and if you're wondering where you can
watch it democracynow.org
um final question before we open it up
to each of you your thoughts on the BDS
movement the boycott divest sanctions
movement
well the BDS um is a set of tactics
right these are tactics that you employ
when you think they're going to be
effective and in ways that you think
will be effective uh tactics are not
principles they're not actions that you
undertake no matter what because you
think they're right tactics are
undertaken if you're serious because you
think they're going to help the victims
that's how you adjust your tactics not
because I think they're right in
principle but because I think they will
be
beneficial that ought to be second
nature to activists also second nature
should be a crucial
distinction between proposing and
advocating I can propose now that we
should all live in peace and love each
other I just proposed it
it's not a serious proposal it becomes a
serious proposal when it is becomes
advocacy it is given I sketch out a path
for getting from here to there then it
becomes serious otherwise it's empty
words uh that's crucial and related to
this well when you took take a look at
the BDS movement which is separate
incidentally from BDS tactics let me
make that clear so when the European
Union issued its directive or when the
that I mentioned or when say the Gates
Foundation withdraws uh investment in
security operations that are being
carried out not only in the occupied
territories but elsewhere that's very
important but that's not the BDS
movement that's BDS tactics actually BD
tactics boyot investment tactics uh
that's important the BDS movement itself
itself has been an impetus to these
developments and in many ways a positive
one but I think it has failed and should
reflect on its so far unwillingness to
face what are crucial questions for
activists what's going to help the
victims and what's going to harm them
what is a proposal and what is real
advocacy you have to think that through
and it hasn't been sufficiently done so
if you take a look at the principles of
the VDS movement there are
three they vary slightly in wording but
basically three one is uh actions should
be directed against the
occupation that has been extremely
successful in many ways and it makes
sense it also helps educate the Western
populations who are being appealed to to
participate enables it's an opening to
discuss investigate organize about the
participation in the occupation it's
very successful a second uh principle is
that BDS actions should be continued
until Israel allows the refugees to
return that has had no success and to
the extent that it's been tried it's
been negative
it just leads to a backlash no basis has
been laid for it among the population it
is simply interpreted as saying oh you
want to destroy the state of Israel
we're not going to destroy a state you
cannot undertake actions which you think
are principled when the real in the real
world they are going to have a harmful
effect on the victims there's a third
category having to do with civil rights
within Israel and there are are things
that could be done here one of the ones
I mentioned in fact the taxfree status
for us organizations that are engaged in
civil rights VI and human rights
violations and remember a tax exemption
means I pay for it that's what a tax
exemption is well that's an action could
be undertaken others that have been
undertaken have had a backlashes which
are harmful and U I won't run through
the record but these are the kinds of
questions that always have to be asked
when you're involved in serious
activisms if you care about the victims
not just feeling good but caring about
the victims that's critically important
we're going to open
up we're going to open up this
discussion and I see on the request list
the first up is the state of
Palestine thank you very
much and and uh I would like uh to
begin by uh stating on behalf of the
Palestinian people and the Palestinian
leadership our gratitude and uh
admiration to Professor chamski for his
principal position in supporting the
just cause of the Palestinian
people and his name is an inspiring name
in uh all of our colleges
universities among the activists and
even among those who are uh struggling
against the occupation in towns like bin
nin and so many of them on daily basis
while the Palestinian people are
continuing their struggle to attain
their National rights including their
right to self-determination St statehood
freedom and
Independence
of course also we are very grateful for
the committee on the exercise on the in
rights for organizing this event one of
uh the events I would say that a very
special event as we uh commemorate the
international year of solidarity with
the Palestinian people that was a
resolution adopted by the general
assembly that this year to be a special
year in trying to give a big push to
advance the cause of the Palestinian
people and of course we would like to
thank you very much for moderating this
event which as uh judging from the
number of people is a very uh successful
event and I believe the Palestinian
people who just came out of a very
bloody aggression that started in the
West Bank through East Jerusalem and
went for three 50 days on the Gaza Strip
uh do really uh appreciate the fact that
uh there is this big support as we see
it here and I'm a diplomat I know that
we have an immense support among the
community of Nations one can see it
through the voting on resolutions not
only on the historic one on November 29
2012 in which in this chamber the uh uh
great majority of Nations uh recognize
the state of Palestine and change the
status to an observer state so we are
grateful for all these things and we are
very grateful for that comprehensive uh
presentation by Professor
chamski I just want to add to you know
to concentrate in two
areas uh I listened very closely to
everything that you have said and I
agree with what you've said in
connection with the policy of the United
States of America Vis A the Palestinian
people and their cause and I totally
agree with you with regard to the
policies and practices of the occupying
uh Authority and the Israeli government
viav the Palestinian people particularly
in the occupied territory but what I
just want to add which I am sure you
know it but I need just to make sure
that it comes out loud and clear that in
this equation it is not only the
Israelis who are dictating policies and
dictating the future of the Palestinian
people nor the Americans as well it is
the Palestinian people who are a very
important uh element of this
configuration it appears that our
situation is extremely difficult because
it is but our determination is so strong
that in all of the battle that that we
were forced to to go through including
the ones in the West Bank East Jerusalem
and in the Gaza Strip not a single
person from the Palestinians
raised the White Flag so we the
Palestinian people are determined to
continue the struggle in spite of the
fact that it is so difficult in order to
uh attain our freedom and to learn from
everyone including from the remarkable
experience in South Africa although I
agree with you we have so many
differences in terms of the two
experiences although we have many in
common uh but yet our people are dead
determined that we do not want to stay
in band stands in aperti style in occup
under occupation we are determined to uh
uh accomplish the objective of ending
the occupation and the independence of
our state and our freedom we are doing
our share as a key player in this
configuration and we are very gr very
grateful for the international support
whether we see it here at the United
Nations through the position of member
states or whether we see it through
activities of civil societies the PDS
and all those who have you know
contributed to resolving causes such as
in Vietnam and in other places we are
you know grateful that they are you know
on our side and they're doing what they
are doing and they're trying to improve
their work so that they can help us to
accomplish uh this objective so on this
point I just wanted to say that we are
in the Forefront we are not a footnote
we are a key player inpired of the fact
that the odds are so huge against us the
odds were so huge against the people in
South Africa but the people of South
Africa came out Victorious the odds were
the odds were so huge against the people
in Vietnam but the Vietnamese people
came Victorious and we are no exception
to the rule and we are determined to
join those who have succeeded in putting
an end to their miseries and acquiring
uh their independence and freedom that's
the first thing the second
thing I I agree with you on the issue of
the the strategy of Israel and those who
support them is to try to divide us so
that the objective of a two- State
two-state solution not to be you know
accomplished in this connection I just
want and I'm sure that you know that but
I want to highlight it and underscore it
that in our
struggle there we've accomplished two
major historic accomplishment since
19448 the first historic accomplishment
that we succeeded in having one party to
speak on behalf of the Palestinians that
is the Palestine Liberation Organization
which is composed of many political
groups among the
Palestinians so it took us tens of years
to be able you know to have a political
representation to speak on behalf of all
of the Palestinian people in the
occupied territory and outside and by
the time we reached the Summit uh of the
Arab Summit in Morocco in
1974 to acknowledge that yes the
Palestine Liberation Organization is the
representative of the Palestinian people
and chairman Arafat came to this very
chamber to speak on behalf of the
Palestinian people and we came back to
the UN after we left it in
1948 that historic accomplishment is
huge and of course with time there were
things that happened including the
examples that you mentioned in Gaza
regardless of the basis of them that
threatened the representation of the
Palestinian people and I am sure that
you know that the Israeli side played an
immense role particularly after the
first intifada in 87 to try to put a
wedge on this issue of the
representation of the Palestinian people
the second historic accomplishment the
fact that we were able to put Palestine
in the geopolitical map because after
1948 our homeland was fragmented into
three pieces as we all know one piece
became Israel the other one was the West
Bank became part of the hashimite
kingdom of Jordan and the Gaza Strip was
put under the Egyptian
Administration in
1988 the struggle of the Palestinian
people succeeded in unifying the
different parts of our homeland so when
we refer to the occupied Palestinian
territory including East Jerusalem in
the singular versus the occupied
Palestinian territories including East
Jerusalem in the plural is it is an
intended uh characterization to reflect
the evolution and the progress in our
movement that we were able to have a one
uh political uh unit that constitute the
total PE toal toal uh land of the State
of Palestine to include the Gaza Strip
the West Bank and East Jerusalem of
course the tragic split that took place
for almost 8 years between the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank is a huge
setback for our national movement and it
was a huge also uh gain for the Israeli
side to destroy that Evolution and to
take us back to the situation that
existed or similar to the situation that
existed in
1948
therefore our uh agreement in April of
this year to uh put an end to the split
and to establish a national consensus
government is a historic step in order
to rectify the damage to these
historical accomplishment within our
movement in terms of the representation
in one hand
the PLO and and also the unity of the
different parts of our homeland in one
geopolitical unit that is the land of
the State of Palestine and I agree with
you that the Israeli attack on us from
the moment that we declared the
agreement on uh putting an end to the
split putting an end to the split uh
officially but of course the
ramification of the split and the wound
wounds that it created it is going to
take us some time of a genuine effort to
learn from that experience that no
matter how we disagree with each other
but we should not play with these two
historic accomplishment the unity of the
land and also the representation of our
people and I agree with you that this
war started immediately in the West Bank
to humilate president Abbas and the
Palestinian leadership because they were
trotting from he through Jerusalem
through ramala to nais to Janine to try
to show the Palestinian people that this
National consensus government means
nothing and you it cannot protect a
single Palestinian nor can uh prevent us
from putting in prison anyone that we
wish including those who have been
released through an agreement of
exchange of prisoners then it went to
Gaza to prove to everyone including to
our brothers in Hamas that maintain the
split everything will be fine and dandy
but if you want to have Unity you have
to pay a huge price for it so that we
want the people in Gaza to be against
you in order to tell you that when you
went in the direction of unity Gaza has
been destroyed to no level even much
more than the two Wars before that so
therefore all these things were tried
including from this chamber prime
minister
Netanyahu after he failed in convincing
as you said uh leaders of the world to
be against the national consensus
government and after he waged this war
in order to push us back to division he
came and he failed in these two uh
attempts he tried from this chamber to
convince the leaders of the world and by
the way there are no Boy Scouts in this
business in this chamber all of them are
very astute diplomat ATS and they know
what they're doing and what they're what
what what is going on when he tried to
convince them for the third time in an
exercise of
futility that Hamas is dases meaning
that if you are building our Isis if you
are building an international consensus
against Isis you should include Hamas in
it thinking that world leaders who did
not approve agreed with him in attacking
the national con his government and did
not agree with him on this war that he
waged against our people in including
the Gaza Strip that they will agree with
him to attack Hamas as being similar you
know to Isis and they did not agree with
him on that event so what I want to just
conclude from that that these two
remarkable things for us to maintain the
unity of our land and to regain the
unity of our political representation
which is the PLO and its government
which is the national consensus
government in which all political groups
including our brothers from Hamas agreed
to its formation and we have to uh to
succeed in the challenges before us in
undertaking the Monumental task of
rebuilding Gaza so that we can continue
in the path of the struggle to put an
end to this occupation to attain our
independence
and you know to attain our freedom and
dignity again I want to thank you very
much for being with us you are you know
a superstar in this chamber and that is
the pulse of the people the pulse of
justice and we are delighted that you
shared these thoughts with us this
afternoon thank
[Applause]
you
I would just like to briefly endorse
those extremely important points and to
register uh my own feeling of uh deep uh
emotion and uh that I always feel when
you see U the
inspiring efforts of people struggling
for their rights under shocking
conditions
and finally even winning them and I
think that will be true for the
Palestinians
too the representative of
Guyana I think it's me but I'm not the
representative I'm so sorry I'm just
sitting in the ruler Jael
my question is if you were the president
of the Palestinian
Authority we asked what would you do
if um what the United States should do
or Israel but if you were the
representative actually what would you
do would you absolve The Authority would
you what steps would you take to solve
the conflict thank
you if I was a representative of the
Palestinian
Authority well I think the most
important things are What U the
Ambassador just described uh overcoming
the split between Gaza and the West Bank
is a step of critical significance and
maintaining the unity government in the
face of the attacks that are being
launched against it from many sides is
going to be a hard battle and a one of
of critical significance another is uh
maintaining the resistance within
Palestine uh of against the steps that
are being taken to gradually dismantle
and cantonize and divide it those are uh
all
require courage and dedication and
commitment of a kind that is familiar to
many of you here who represent countries
that have under undergone National
Liberation struggles and this is another
one one of the
last remember that Palestine is the one
of two remaining colonies that have not
been
decolonized the other is Western
Sahara and uh these are these
struggles continue Merit
our support and have to be led as was
just said by the people of the countries
themselves uh another is to reach out to
International opinion and to try to help
uh educate stimulate
organization uh stimulate policies uh
which will contribute uh to these just
ends those are the constant goals of
National Liberation struggles they apply
in the different ways and different
circumstances but U there's a
commonality that virtually underlies the
existence of the United Nations after
all the United Nations and its form at
least since the
1960s is the result of
decolonization of National Liberation
struggles against the colonial Imperial
Powers many of which have succeeded
which is why you're here others are
still in process
and have to be brought into it and the
Palestinian Authority should be and is
in fact in the lead and conducting these
efforts the representative of South
Africa thank you thank you very much
Madame
moderator and uh we want to express our
sincere gratitude to Professor chsky for
you know the his understanding of the
situation in the Middle East
in particular but his understanding of
the struggle for
Liberation uh all over the world in
general now just two question on of the
two options that you spoke about one the
reality is that uh the facts are being
changed on the ground on daily basis
even now as we speak and in no time I
guess even In Our Lifetime though the
term lifetime is
relative um we we may see a situation
where it may become very difficult to
talk about a two-state
solution uh because of the reality
itself we may not have a piece of land
that we can say the other state will
exist on the basis of this piece of land
now the question that I have similar to
what Lenin raised some decades ago and
say what should the progressive forces
do the progressive
forces now in in in in the prosecution
of the struggle of the Palestinian
people and the second one is linked to
the recent announcements one made in
Sweden about the recognition of the
State of Palestine and a recent recent
vote in the British Parliament uh do you
foresee a possibility that uh such
announcements will be increasing in the
next few years and that may have the
potential to change the balance of
forces including in the security Council
we all know that of the P5 at least
China and Russia are very clear about
where they stand on the matter and um
and and the others as well we know their
position so I'm wondering whether you
think you will see an increase and what
will that mean for the balance of forces
in the UN thank you very
much well uh on with regard to the first
question I think um the effort to
achieve a two-state settlement is by no
means remain finished uh the uh United
States is in a position if there is
sufficient pressure from inside and
outside to essentially terminate the
Israeli
occupation uh the United States can has
the there are many examples like this
take say
U no two cases are identical of course
but take say South Africa uh took a long
time
before intern First International
opinion and finally the United States
was willing to accept the end of
aparte after all it was uh
1988 when President Reagan's
Administration
declared uh the African National
Congress to be one of the more Mo phrase
was one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world that was 1988
just a couple of years before the end of
AAR uh by then the president President
Reagan actually had to try to overcome
Congressional vetos to continue his
support for South Africa uh finally it
happened in the case of East timore
which Amy brought up earlier U the
Indonesian generals um insisted that
they would never leave this was their
territory the one government in the
world the government of Australia under
foreign minister Gareth Evans uh
recognized in the east teamour as a
province of
Indonesia it looked as if you looked at
the balance of forces it looked as if
this was
over enough pressure was put on
President Clinton internationally and
domestically so that he simp
informed the Indonesian military that
the game was over they pulled out each
team were in a difficult and harsh
struggle finally ended up with
Independence and there are other cases I
don't think this struggle is by any
means over not at
all
uh if if it is I think but if if a time
comes when it is over I don't think
we're anywhere near that the United
States and Israel ought to be so
isolated internationally that they will
suffer from having carried out this
crime but I don't think we're at that
stage the progressive forces in the
world can do many things to carry
forward the struggle for a two-state
settlement and Achieve that and
incidentally in my view that is not a
good settlement it may be the best
shortterm one but by no means the end of
the road
uh my expectation would be my hope that
if the cycle of violence can be
reduced uh what we will see is what in
fact has happened in earlier periods
when there has been a reduction in
hostilities and violence namely natural
connections begin to develop across the
boundary it's a very artificial boundary
anyone who knows anything about about
the former Palestine knows that you just
can't draw a sensible line through it so
I assume that as in the past there'll be
beginnings of cultural commercial other
relations leading to the kind of
integration that would be healthy for
both sides in my opinion but will have
to come from their own internal Dynamics
and can and that's not the end of the
road either there is no reason for us to
accept to worship the Imperial imposed
boundaries as in most of the world the
boundaries there are imposed by the
Imperial Powers Britain and France
primarily in this case the boundary
between Israel and Lebanon for for
example is totally artificial actually
60 years ago when I was hiking in
Northern Israel I walked across it by
accident and somebody had to call me and
tell me to come back I'm in another
country it just means nothing nothing it
just breaks a natural region in part I
think those borders can erode it's
actually beginning to happen in many
parts of the world uh it's in that
context I think that there might be a
meaningful solution eventually to the
very pressing and significant Refugee
problem there's a long way to go and I
think there are many steps that can be
taken um I don't think we're anywhere
near saying look it's over we have to
give up
uh what was the second question I forgot
already the second the second part of
that
question the the second part of that
question was in relation to the recent
announcement one by the new government
of Sweden on the recognition of the
State of Palestine and the recent vote
in Britain on the recognition as well
and the impact is likely going to have
and the possibility of the balance of
forces being tilted in favor of the
Palestinian struggle
I think these are very important steps
the Swedish moves breaks the unanimity
of the West in refusing to join the
world on this issue remember it's most
of the world has already gone this way
um my recollection is over 130 countries
uh have recognized the state of
Palestine the Swedish move kind of
breaks a log Jam for the West the
British parliamentary vote
is not a government
decision as I think I said the
conservative party essentially followed
Israel's request that it ignore the vote
so it's a it's a minority vote but
significant reflects the shift of
attitudes and understanding and every
one of those shifts stimulates further
moves and here's a message to activists
can be used to stimulate further moves I
think this can spread and if it spread
sufficiently it will contribute to
rehabilitating reconstructing the
possibility of a viable two-state
settlement in my view as a step towards
other things that will be much
preferable Mr Mr lofty mic number
2271 H hi Dr Dr chsky and am thank you
very much for this excellent U
proceedings here
today uh United States has always been a
problem I think in this issue and I
believe uh if you can solve it from here
the people in the region may solve it
among themselves I think we are the main
issue as you said the job is with the
activist and I was wondering uh what's
your thoughts about what is our hang up
with unconditional support of Israel
over the years
psychologically socially in what reason
is it that over the years and I've been
educated through your books through
democracy Now the fact that we always on
the wrong side of the history on this
issue what is it that makes us be like
that is have you thought about that and
this could be a subject of your next
book why do we unconditionally support
it I couldn't hear it could
you make that last point in a sentence
why why do we unconditionally support
Israel in most of the cases we have
never been we OB we out everything and
we always end up being on the wrong side
of the history what is it
psychologically or socially that we
unconditionally support Israel being the
United States yes United States yeah why
does the United States support Israel
well there's a history and a very
interesting one that actually goes back
to uh goes back a long time one thing to
remember is that Christian
Zionism is a very powerful force which
goes back long before Jewish Zionism in
England particularly Christian Zionism
was a powerful force among British
Elites it's part of the motivation for
the Baler declaration and for Britain's
support for Jewish colonization of
Israel remember the Bible said you know
and that's a big part of U British Elite
culture same in the United States wdro
Wilson was
a devout Christian who read the Bible
every day so did Harry Truman uh in the
Roosevelt administration one of the
leading officials Harold IIs once
described the return of the Jews to
Palestine as the greatest event in
history it's realizing the lesson of the
Bible uh these are deeply religious
countries in which the biblical commands
soall are taken quite literally also
this is just part of
colonization this is the last phase of
European
colonization and notice that the
countries that are most strongly in
support of Israel are not just the
United States it's the United States
Australia and Canada the offshoots of
England anglosphere sometimes called
unusual forms of imperialism these are
settler Colonial societies col Societies
in which the not like India not like the
British and India say the societies
South Afric was a little like this or
Algeria under the French settler
Colonial Societies in which the settlers
came in essentially eliminated the
native
population also driven by religious
principles very religious groups driven
by Christian Zionism those are major
cultural factors there are also
significant geostrategic factors in you
go back to
1948 there was actually a split between
the state department and the Pentagon in
the United States over how to react to
the new state of Israel the state
department
was was was question was not committed
strongly to Israeli conquests the
establishment of the state and was
concerned about the refugees it wanted
an implementation of the refugee problem
the Pentagon on the other hand record
was very impressed with Israel's
military potential the Israeli military
successes uh if you look back at the
internal record and
Declassified uh The Joint Chiefs of
Staff described Israel as the second
largest military force force in the
region after turkey and a potential base
for us power in the region that
continued can't run through the whole
record but in
1958 when there was a serious crisis in
the region uh uh Israel was the only
state that strongly cooperated with
Britain and the United States and it won
plenty of support from the governments
and the military for that reason 1967 is
when the current relations with Israel
were pretty much established Israel
performed a major service to the United
States by destroying a secular Arab
nationalism a major enemy of the United
States and supporting radical Islam
which the US supported and it continues
right until the present uh right now we
saw an example of that just during the U
Gaza latest Gaza attack you recall that
uh at one point Israel began to run out
of Munitions during the assault despite
the fact that it's a armed to the teeth
that the United States provided Israel
with additional Munitions through the
Pentagon and notice where they were
taken from these were M us Munitions
prepositioned in Israel for eventual use
by US
forces one of many signs of how the
Israel is regarded as essentially a
military offsho to the United States
very close intelligence relations that
go way back many other connections and
the media tend to take up to to support
the policy of the government with very
few you know kind of little questioning
around the edges but basically accept
the policy so for example take another
issue take the US invasion of
Iraq you cannot find the phrase US
invasion of Iraq in the US media that
was obviously an invasion a blatant
active aggression a textbook case
of that's Newberg trials called the
Supreme International crime cannot be
mentioned uh President Obama is praised
as an opponent of the invasion and what
did he say he said it's a mistake it's a
strategic blunder we're not going to get
away with it that's about as that's the
kind of opposition that uh you heard
from the German general staff during
Hitler's invasion of Russia it's a
blunder shouldn't do it should knock off
England first that's regarded as
opposition same in Vietnam it's now
there's now a commemoration underway big
commemoration of us sacrifices in
Vietnam try to find the phrase us invas
invasion of South
Vietnam there or anywhere in the past
year since 1961 when it took place
non-existent maybe on Democracy Now I
what I write but way out of The Fringe
and this is not unique to the United
States take say Britain right now
there's interesting debates in the
British literary journals like the times
literary supplement as to whether
Britain should finally begin to
recognize
the genocidal the word that's used
genocidal character of British
colonization hundreds of years ago
should Israel should Britain begin to
face it you know you can ask that
question in many places uh the tendency
of the uh intellectual Community to go
along like a herd in support
of state power private power is just
overwhelming uh we intellectuals like to
think of themselves as dissident
critical courageous standing up against
Power absolutely untrue you look at the
historical record that's a small Fringe
and they're usually punished the
mainstream tends to be what was once
called a herd of independent Minds
marching in support of state power
nothing new here unfortunate have to
fight against it not
new we're just going to take two more
questions the first is from the
representative of
Cuba next up is mic number 2192 Mr
KET
um
and um my question is who should morally
be
in um my name is Caleb moin I'm a
correspondent with press tv news and um
in the last couple days there have been
reports in the US media quoting figures
from the mujahadin culk which is a
terrorist organization um alleging that
Iran is developing nuclear weapons uh um
and it has been leaked that the Israeli
government has cooperated with mujahadin
cul to assassinate Iranian nuclear
scientists and my question is is that a
violation of international law and why
is it that Israel is cooperating with
what is was at one point universally
recognized as a violent terrorist
organization violation of international
we can debate this or that U fact that's
not yet accepted and agreed but there
are gross violations of international
law which are proclaimed openly and
public publicly uh and presented with
self-praise so for example suppose that
when President Obama or any Western any
American Diplomat or journalist says
that with regard to Iran all options are
open as is said constantly what does
that mean all options are open means
force is open means nuclear attack is
open uh those of you who may recall or
obscure document called the UN Charter
might remember article two which bans
the threat or use of force in
international Affairs the threat or use
of force they're all violating
international law openly and proudly and
the same is true when they support
criminal organizations the US and Israel
don't deny their they kind of nod their
heads about say the assassination of
Iranian scientists or the the cyber
attacks on Iran which are openly
acknowledged and praised all violations
of international law what about Iranian
nuclear weapons well you know there are
ways to approach the question of nuclear
weapons in fact some of you may recall
who have a long memory back as far as
2010 when an agreement was reached
between turkey Brazil and Iran to settle
the issue of Iranian nuclear development
the agreement was that Iran would uh
transfer to Turkey its low enriched
uranium so there' be no issue of
developing nuclear weapons and in return
the Western Powers would provide Iran
with the Isotopes it needs for its
medical research as soon as that
agreement was reached it was bitterly
denounced by the US government by
President Obama by Congress by the media
how dare they do this the government of
Brazil was kind of irritated and its
foreign minister released a letter from
President Obama to president Lula of
Brazil proposing exactly
this presumably he proposed it because
he thought that would Iran would never
agree well Iran did agree so then came
the attack then come all kind of
pretexts that's 2010 let's go on to
2012 okay a little more recent maybe
easier to remember in December
2012 there was supposed to be a
conference in
Helsinki organized under un
opes the nonproliferation treaty
organized a conference in Helsinki to
take step towards establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
actually a zone free of weapons of mass
destruction but crucially nuclear
weapons that was December 2012
International Conference uh everyone
waited to see Israel said they would not
attend next question what'll Iran say
Iran said they would attend with no
conditions couple of days later the
United States C the
conference uh pretexts you know this is
that reason but it didn't take place uh
virtually no mention of this in the US
media do a study tells you something
about the
media hardly a mention well that's
another
opportunity uh lots of ways of dealing
with the nuclear weapons problem and of
course recall that there is one state in
the region which is armed to the teeth
with nuclear weapons hundreds of nuclear
weapons the state of Israel with us
support uh so there are things that can
be done about the nuclear weapons issue
if anyone's serious about it but as far
as your point about violating
international law is concerned all the
time openly and
proudly we'll end with m nen Daria framy
of the Israel Palestine mission network
of the Presbyterian Church
USA thank you number
2324 thank you I want to thank you for
mentioning uh the Presbyterian Church's
vote this summer for the B and the D
tactic as you as you put it um we voted
to divest from the three American
companies who profit from the occupation
uh so thanks for mentioning that and um
uh but my question actually was is is
unrelated
um how would you respond to the
charge that anti-zionism is the new
anti-Semitism actually
the locus clausus the best formulation
of this was by uh an ambassador to the
United Nations ABA Evan Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations uh and
an article that he
wrote about 45 years ago which I urge
you to read uh which appeared in an
American Jewish Journal Congress weekly
a major journal of the more liberal wing
of the American Jewish Community he
wrote an interesting article in which he
he was then un ambassador from the state
of Israel he advised the American Jewish
community that they had uh two tasks to
perform one task was to show that
criticism of the policy what do you call
anti-zionism that means actually
criticisms of the policy of the state of
Israel were
anti-Semitism that's the first task
second task if the criticism was made by
Jews their task was to show that it's
neurotic self-hatred needs psychiatric
treatment and he gave two examples of
the latter latter category one was if of
stone the other was me so we have to be
treated for our psychiatric disorders
and non-jews have to be condemned for
anti-Semitism if they're critical of the
state of Israel it's understandable why
uh Israeli propaganda would take this
position I don't particularly blame ABA
Evan for doing what ambassadors are
sometimes supposed to do but we ought to
understand it there is no sensible
charge no sensible charge there's
nothing to respond to it's not a form of
anti-Semitism it's simply criticism of
the criminal actions of a
state
period well as
we when you have the great muckraking
journalist IFC Stone and leading
political dissident in the United States
today Nome chamski um criticizing you
you know you have to reconsider your
position uh it has been wonderful uh
hearing from Professor Nom Chomsky today
as you gathered a crowd of hundreds of
people um to hear you thank you so much
for being with us and tune in to
democracynow.org where you can see this
whole uh session as well as other
interviews with Professor Chomsky thanks
