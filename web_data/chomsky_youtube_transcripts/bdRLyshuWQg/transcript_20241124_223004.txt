mandarins understanding power the
Chomsky Foucault debate on human nature
on language objectivity and liberal
scholarship the Fateful triangle and
many others his latest book is notes on
Resistance interviews by David barsamian
joining me for part two of our interview
is Professor Elm Chom
I wonder if you could speak about the
origins of authoritarianism and
neo-fascism in the United States as well
as uh much of the rest of the world from
Victor Orban in Hungary to Narendra Modi
you mentioned him last week in India
what are the forces that created these
political monstrosities and I I wonder
how similar this moment in history is to
the 1930s
you know that
touches a
personal as a personal meaning to me I'm
old enough to remember the 30s
well it's uh
and there's a certain irony
in the 1930s as a child I could
sense the enormous fear that fascism was
spreading inexorably over the world
well actually this first order at the
Lightroom Peak out of school newspapers
an article it was about to fall of
Barcelona the Franco's victory in Spain
austrated gone Czechoslovakia had gone
now Spain has gone as if everyone went
ahead
there was at that time a sign of Hope
the United States
the United States was breaking from the
fascist pattern that there was fascist
elements here with the New Deal new
labor action while beginnings of social
democracy that stood counter to the
collapses of Continental Europe it's
fascism
unfortunately it's not being replicated
in some ways even the opposite of
take a look at
orban's Hungary which you mentioned
that's
a striking case
Orban has created what he called an
illiberal democracy means no democracy
state power takes over destroys the
media
destroys the academic world no political
parties no independent institutions
create a Christian nationalist
reactionary Christian nationalist uh
racist state
that's Victor Orban
that's the ideal of the Republican Party
we say it
about a month ago there was a conference
in Budapest
of the far right organizations in Europe
with many with
neo-fascist Origins
in Budapest naturalism because that's
the ideal
the star
participant
was the conservative political action
conference it's basically the core of
the Republican Party
they actively participated
Trump trump gave a speech Lord reynor by
honestly vision of the future
Tucker Carlson went wild about it he
worships and on the documentary about
him a couple weeks later there was a
conference in Dallas Texas run by the
same group conservative political
election conference Corps of the
Republican Party
who was the keynote speaker Victor Urban
and that's the ideal to which we want to
strive
racist
critical fascist
Christian nationalist
illiberal
society which crushes independent
thought
Independent Media to the extent that
they learn and the other institutions
well
in a week in a couple of weeks there's
going to be a vote about that in the
United States
Supreme Court has already been
basically handed over to these forces
Mr Soledad makes speeches at the Vatican
in which he almost says in the other
school most reactionary courts and
memory taking up this coming term so
really scary cases that had no reason to
take up other than as an effort to try
to undermine democracy even further and
lay the basis for take over the country
but
far right minority party
Republican party I hate to call the
report even more well
that can be a permanent governing party
there's a minority party what kind of
scenery and mechanisms including cases
the court has decided to take up like
Morrissey
which could lead the basis for
legislators in States so simply
overturning the popular vote could blow
that for him these are all developments
taking place right here
perfectly open
uh taking place in Europe
the Modi case I think has
slightly different Origins that's
creating a racist hinduismocracy in a
country with a very large Muslim
population
and tearing to shreds Indian circular
democracy it fits into the pattern but
with somewhat different sources
in the west I think
a large part of what's Happening very
large part is the bitter Savage class
Ward that's been conducted to the last
40 years
it's called neoliberalism
even has rhetoric about markets and so
on but that's fighting for misleading
it's basically Savage class war and it
was understood by the leaders
stores with Reagan and Thatcher their
first moves in office we're to attack
undermine the labor Muslim opening the
door Airport
the corporate sector to enter with
illegal strike breaking efforts uh
organization efforts tolerated by the
criminal state that made sense if you're
going to carry out a bitter Savage class
Ward that are eliminate all the means of
defense and it's going on
to the United States we have measures of
I'm sure you know the Iran Corporation
but a year again came out with an
estimate that to
about 50 trillion dollars it's not
pennies
50 trillion dollars had been transferred
to the pockets of the top one percent up
to a fraction of them mostly in those
last 40 Years of class one meanwhile
real wages have stagnated and for male
workers uh benefits is collapsed
in fact it's quite striking you look
back at the 1970s the United States was
not all that different from other
industrial powers and such things as
cost of Health Care all availability of
health care
mortality
incarceration measure after measure then
it started splitting
uh bad enough in the other industrial
societies England is
much like the United States to some
extent in Europe well with all of these
things have done is create
ways of anger resentment for
institutions
hopelessness uh
and it's just fertile Terrain
for demigods Trump's a persecutive
sample very good at it
comes
stands with a
sign in one hand saying I love you
well in the other hand he's stabbing in
the back his entire legislative program
is a bitter attack on working people in
the quarter similar things have been
happening in Europe
individually the individual cases you
can see differences but it's pretty
common already and this
I mean it's not the first time American
history
you look back to the 1920s there wasn't
all that different from the day the
labor had been crushed by Woodrow
Wilson's
repressive actions red scared the worst
of Christian American history and simply
used the Espionage to undermine uh
political parties Social Security
independent thought Independent Media
labor huge inequality
that was then
we're in living in a similar period and
I said well there are many different
causes for the phenomena get destroyed
but I think there's one fundamental
strain that underlies all of them when
you
destroy the social orders
destroy the
possibilities for people to organize and
protect themselves atomize the society
people living with precarious jobs man
go through Trump's territory rural towns
in the United States the industries are
gone thanks to Bill Clinton's okay
neoliberal globalization
programs which were explicitly designed
to undermine American labor and to
support the investor rights and
corporate rights and did that in fact
labor was opposed to those but they were
dismissed Chris wouldn't even talk about
their proposals uh well I was escorted
of young people living people
mortality is even increasing which is
unheard of in the white working place
nothing like that's happened to sign
they're called by economists that's the
spirit
was going on for the last couple of
years in this kind of environment you
can get uh support for fruit and fish is
elements of the
Trump variety or Bond
Melania in Italy
so many Suraj and England well yes it
needs a crop up another this virtual
territory for them
and I think it's the right answers
can be achieved is what was done in the
30s labor movement reviled
and political organizations that were
Lively
middle labor action took place
Central theater Administration
you got the origins of social democracy
a lot of things to criticize and
athletic but too
obvious and step forward sure
basic human rights yeah well soon
I want to ask about the Democratic party
uh because this kind of slow motion
corporate coup d'etat to steal a line
from John Ralston Saul produced these
figures like Clinton who you mentioned
Tony Blair the labor had some voice in
the labor party in the UK and in the
Democratic party and as you correctly
pointed out uh Clinton betrayed labor we
now see the Biden Administration that it
is not able to fulfill its most teepid
campaign promises including 15 minimum
wage it's billed back better plan to
what extent is the
ineffectiveness uh and even alliance
with the Democratic party with corporate
America to blame for the rise of this
neo-fascism
considerably
storage in the late court order years
the Democratic Party in the 1970s
basically
abandoned
whatever commitment it had
to the working close and the court
became a party of affluent professionals
kind of people who show up at Obama's
fancy parties to listen to Beyonce
uh the uh the last gas supposed to
listen to concern for the interest of
working people was the Humphrey Hawkins
full employment bill of 1978.
Carter didn't veto it but he watered it
down so that it was toothless
volunteering since then it's hard to
find anything it's just so yes that
means that there's no defense for
working people
in the political system
to Biden's credit
it is better than I expected I should
say on the domestic firm not
International
so take the bill back better program
which I think probably came out of
Bernie Sanders's office in that his
internet budget committee and was based
on lots of activism
on the ground mostly by young people
just as a climate group was which wasn't
a bad program
was cut away step by step
by a hundred percent
uh
Republican opposition Republicans are
the political party there are some other
kind of organization gotta block
everything
that might help the public but might
rebound to the benefit of the other
party so block everything in a couple of
right-wing Democrats and went along
well you can argue that if I could have
fought much harder so in he's not a
fighter he's not worship well
nevertheless by the standards of the
past he did take some steps
that towards the time when the Democrats
had at least some kind of concerns or
wooden people in the poor couldn't get
very far with it
let's do the shift to the right over the
past couple of generations it's pretty
startling and then you go back and you
look at somebody like
Dwight Eisenhower
I mean I remember when Eisenhower was
elected in 52 I thought the world was
coming to an end okay we have such a
reactionary president you look back now
it looks like a slain liberal
institutions are not all that different
from Bernie Sanders and many errors
strong supporter in the New Deal
speeches saying that anybody who doesn't
think that workers should have the right
to organize doesn't belong in our
political system that's conservatism
back in the 1950s
uh Bernie Sanders is who I think is
doing a great job is considered very
radical with positions that
by our pests and we're served by
European standards like moderate social
democracy
well we countries really shifted in the
last 50 or 60 years with the mainly with
the neoliberal assault which we should
regard as what it is
Savage class war
and one of the major victims is all of
organized Human Society
it's led by climate desires it's a
hundred percent of the Republican party
from this course
they're going to kill us all
maximize the use of fossil fuels
eliminate measures to
mitigate the disaster
we have a narrow window in which we can
overcome
what will be the final crisis for human
beings on Earth
narrow Windows being closed
by these forces they already have the
Supreme Court
they're likely to take Congress
lay the basis for
undercutting Democratic elections by all
sorts of means that we're familiar with
may be coming
permanent minority poetry leading the
way over the precipice joyfully with the
strong support of the corporate sector
which is gleeful
as probes bloated with prophets as its
racing to destroy the world
it's an astonishing picture
I want to ask about foreign policy uh
and Ukraine uh we've given some 50
billion dollars in weapons and Aid to
Ukraine that's almost the entire budget
of the state department and usaid
uh you Seymour Melman and others have
written about the permanent War economy
and the economic and social consequences
of that uh unchecked militarism is often
cited by historians such as Arnold tonby
as the principal reason for the collapse
of Empires is this where we are and if
we are what does collapse look like you
have given the current rhetoric and the
perpetuation of the war in Ukraine it
may look like a nuclear Holocaust
you know
there are unique characteristics here
you
captured U.S policy accurately
official U.S policy
continually
reiterated by
defense secretary Lord Austin and others
is we must
perpetuate the war in Ukraine
in order to severely weaken Russia
meaning no diplomatic and civil
perpetuates award meanwhile we are
pouring out resources into destruction
others orders will
we keep on the present course
we're going to go over the precipice
we're already reaching irreversible
tipping points World Meteorological
association just I think yesterday a
couple days ago
that came out within an ALICE saying
we've got to double renewable electric
but 2030 or else we're done for
now we have to end fossil fuel use spray
what's called Net Zero about 2050 when
we shouldn't be misled by lead
Net Zero can mean and the corporate
Checker wants it to mean keep using
fossil fuels and pretend to remove the
poisons from that unless you're not bad
when they talk about Netgear they mean
stop using them except at the fringes
don't rely on them well that's quite a
task it's feasible but well we instead
of working on that what we're working on
is maximizing the use of fossil fuels
we need them for the war in Ukraine we
need them because the gas prices are
development and so on
in fact sometimes
when you look at what the human species
is doing
and take one of the best newspapers in
the world
the Israeli newspaper or
spiritual newspaper critical and
defending news
as a lead article today
morning
the agreement between
living and
Israel Over the natural gas fields in
the Mediterranean near the border
just take a look at the scientific
analysis a week ago
Israeli scientists were quite good
came out with
analyzes showing that their earlier
estimates were 40 conservative that the
Mediterranean Eastern Mediterranean was
going to rise
two and a half meters by the end of the
century 10 feet perfume
can you imagine what that means
here you have living it in Israel
squabbling Over who will administer the
coup de grace when the two countries
collapse into water
um if you wanted to write it
sat tighter on the human species
you wouldn't know how to do it because
what they're doing exceeds out there
all the same things happening in South
Asia
same things happening nothing praying
maximized instruction don't move to a
negotiated settlement that's
you know try to say something about that
your announced as uh
muratic Improvement then beside the
other thing I swear almost all the world
wants back to the question we discussed
the last week but not knowing what
people want I mean almost the entire
world is falling for a negotiated
settlement right now even uh
three-quarters of Germans right through
Euros no can't have it got to keep the
war going the weekend Russia
pouring out fossil fuels reversing the
limited measures to try to deal with the
overwhelming crisis from facing
if you look at the details
you hardly know how to talk about them
take a look at the corporate section
I'm sure you saw this but a couple of
weeks one of the big concerns of
scientists is the eating Authority is
going much for faster than the rest of
the world which exposes the karma for us
permafrost has a huge
colossal amount of carbine if it melts
it will goes into the atmosphere well
one of the oil companies chronicled
Phillips their scientists figure quality
clever way to slow down the warming
nearly permits for us some technique for
driving cooling garage into it great why
are they doing it
so that they can Harden the surface of
the permafrost and drill oil drill for
oil
are we all insane
I mean you can help to do button yeah
you know what's left of the climate Bill
a little bit not much provides credits
for curtain removal removals curtains of
the atmosphere
so Exxon mobils going into new fields
that have so much carbon in them but
they they don't want to use them for oil
and they're drilling there so they can
get carbon in which they can then remove
by some
mostly non-existent technology and get
credits uh subsidies from the government
looks like capitalism going insane
took not just Savage capitalism going
totally insane well this is happening
these are rides
it's like the end of Easter Island uh I
want to ask whether you think the
corporate state is reformable uh or does
it have to be overthrown uh the way the
decayed communist regimes in Eastern
Europe and the old Soviet Union were
overthrown I know you support Extinction
Rebellion as do I that's certainly the
position they're coming from
well I can understand reasoning
well what I was just discussing which is
a tiny sample uh supports the original
but there's a problem
time
look at the time scales
for dealing with the
huge problem of hitting destroying the
environment
compare that with the possible time
scale for a large-scale change in our
socioeconomic system
they're not in sync
the timing for dealing with the climate
catastrophe is much narrower so like it
or not we're gonna craft it deals with
this problem within a
reformed
controlled regimented
State capitalist system
we've been at work on trying to go
beyond at the same time shouldn't give
those up but I think that's the real
world that we're living in well that's
not impossible
remember that before the
neoliberal plus War over the last 40
years
there was a parent of what's called
Richmond headed capitalism
not Beautiful by any means but under
control
that's when you had conservative like
Eisenhower strongly supported labor runs
very high growth rate highest in history
but pretty egalitarian a lot of programs
and many different no financial crisis
plus the treasury Department was doing
its job and it was very good and just
opened the speed let's do it it's a good
one to enrich yourself but then
financial crisis after crisis and
bailouts and so on but that didn't
happen in the 50s and citizens well it
was capitalism another state federalism
money Applause serious ones but at least
not suicidal like the current system
so
I don't think it's possible then we're
about the same time I think we should be
working to lay the basis and
Consciousness and institutions for
knowing will be on
