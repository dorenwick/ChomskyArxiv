how do countries like Britain and
America
break away from the as you put it
western party line uh Jeremy corbyn I
think just agreed with you on lots of
things actually in in politics he he
went to the country twice and he lost
twice it turned out the country did not
want Jeremy corbyn to be prime minister
well you know perfectly well that that's
not what happened
Jeremy corbyn won an enormous victory in
2017. that we didn't
yes the biggest victory that labor had
won in the generations he lost he didn't
become Prime Minister
then what happened is the British
establishment including your newspaper
came down on him with a ton of bricks
with false deceitful propaganda about
anti-Semitism all exposed as lies
totally that's just not true I'm afraid
that's just not true labor MPS left the
labor party because of anti-Semitism uh
when Jeremy corbyn was leading it was
nothing to do with with what I was doing
the labor MPS quit the party in protest
at Jeremy corbyn's record absolutely the
Parliamentary party
the blairite Parliamentary party did not
want to see in fact they said it we have
the documents in the labor files say we
do not want to lose our party the party
that we own to this effort to develop a
popular based party working for working
people in the poor we don't want to lose
our party do that no that's not the one
they said that's not what they said they
did not want he said you can read it in
the labor they did not say they did not
want a government that wants to act for
the poor what they said was they will
not earn someone exactly they don't want
to lose their party all right
or the track record of tolerating
anti-Semitism in the labor party and uh
taking anti-west positions including
wants to give Russia the benefit of the
doubt over the Salisbury poisonings was
one of the big things that they they
protested there's no there's no
anti-west positions for example when
Jeremy corbyn uh takes the position that
we ought to try to move towards a
negotiated settlement in Ukraine that's
not an anti-west position only answer
your quiet position the party line
I don't have a party line I'm just
asking you a question about Jeremy
corbyn twice went up for election and
twice he didn't become Prime Minister
that's two defeats here let's read let's
go back to the fact
2017 he lived he won the big he lost he
lost sorry there was the biggest labor
in history then came the well that was
it no it wasn't he lost
that it was the biggest labor gain in
history then no oh god oh what no it
wasn't on what basis was it
then came the enormous establishment
attack crossed the board right to left
so it's called Left Guardian with
deceitful lies all since exposed about
charges of anti-Semitism no that's not
true I'm sorry the the equality and
Human Rights Commission in the UK the
Watchdog set up by the labor party found
the labor party guilty of not protecting
Jews within the party less
anti-Semitism in the labor party than
among the Tories this has all been
exposed in detail by the labor files you
can read it and Al Jazeera the British
press has chosen to mostly suppress it
and marginalize it but that's a problem
for the British press Corbin has since
been virtually kicked out of the labor
party his effort to try to develop a
popular based party
participatory party that would serve the
interests of working people in the poor
was smashed by the British establishment
to Scandal okay
but has nothing to do with these other
things that we're talking about no well
I suppose my original question was how
does politics change in the western
America and Britain is Kirsten the right
person to try and
recalibrate Britain's position in the
world to not toe the line that you're
you're talking about what do you think
of Kirsten
how is it done you know perfectly well
take the New Deal in the 1930s which I'm
old enough to remember first thing
the labor movement in the United States
had been crushed almost totally by
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare
1930s began to recoup reorganize a CIO
organizing militant actions moderately
sympathetic Administration
introduced Social Democratic policies
which in fact
were later picked up by Europe in the
post-war period That's the Way politics
changed
something else has hurt them
40 years ago Reagan and Thatcher
launched a major assault against the
population
Quest War bitter class war
First Act they'd undertook was to
destroy the Liberty Movement very
sensible
it's the one defense against bitter
class reward then came uh I'd go through
the details if you like but if you want
a number we have it from the Rand
Corporation respectable Corporation they
estimate the transfer of wealth from the
lower 90 percent of the population
working class in middle class
transfer of wealth to them to the top
one percent during the Reagan years
Clinton and the rest of them had 50
trillion dollars that's impressive class
war
left the population
uh real wages for
non-supervisory workers are about what
they were in 1979 a case after case I
can go through if you like similar
things have happened elsewhere Britain
with the harsh Authority program said
written way back continent has held out
somewhat they still have some president
with the Social Democratic policies all
of this is left
populations angry resentful
distrustful institutions quite rightly
easy to pray the demagogues of the Trump
Urban bolsonaro or farage variety okay
that's what's happened in the last 40
years how do you change it the way you
changed it in the 1930s by political
action and organization revitalization
the labor movement and so on
