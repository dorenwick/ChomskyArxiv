let's begin with a classic paradigm
which is throughout the Industrial
Revolution which has been cited by
theorists from Marx to Kropotkin to
Prudhomme to yourself that you build a
consciousness among workers within the
manufacturing class and eventually you
lead to a kind of autonomous position
where workers can control their own
production we now live in a system a
globalized system where most of the
working class in industrial countries
like the United States are service
workers we have reverted to a Dickens
Sounion system where those who actually
produced live in conditions that begin
to replicate almost slave labor and I
think as you have written in places like
southern China in fact our slave what's
the new paradigm for resistance you know
how do we learn from the old and
confront the new well I think the I
think we can draw many very good lessons
from the early period of the Industrial
Revolution of course earlier in England
but let's take care of the United States
the Industrial Revolution took off right
around here eastern Massachusetts mid
nineteenth century this was a period
when independent farmers were being
driven into the industrial system men
and women incidentally women from the
farms of gold factory girls and they
bitterly resented it
they had it was a period of a very Free
Press the most in the in the history of
the country there was a wide variety of
journals ethnic labor others and when
you read them they're pretty fascinating
the people driven into the industrial
system regarded it as an attack on their
personal dignity on their rights as
human being
they were free human beings who were
being forced into what they called wage
slavery which they regarded is not very
different from chattel slavery in fact
this was such a popular view that was
actually a slogan of the Republican
Party that the the only difference
between working for a wage and being a
slave is that working for a wage is
supposedly temporary that pretty soon
you'll be free other than that they're
not different and they bitterly resented
the fact that the the industrial system
was even taking away their rich cultural
life and the cultural life was rich
another by now studies of the British
working-class and American working class
and they were part of the high culture
of the day actually I remember this as
late as the 1930s with my own family
industrial sort of unemployed
working-class and they said this was
being taken away from us we're being
forced to be something like slaves they
argued that if you if you're a say a
journeyman clique craftsman and you sell
your product you're selling your what
you produced if your wage if your wage
earner you're selling yourself which is
deeply offensive they condemned what
they called the new spirit of the age
gained wealth forgetting all but self
sounds familiar and it was extremely
radical it was combined with a the most
radical democratic movement in American
history the populist the early populist
movement radical farmers began in Texas
spreaded to the Midwest enormous
movement of farmers who wanted to free
themselves from the domination by the
northeastern bankers and capitalists
because it ran the markets you know sort
of forced them to a silver
what they produced on credit and squeeze
them with credit and so on they went on
to develop their own banks their own
cooperatives they started to link up
with the Knights of Labor major labor
movement which held that as they put it
those those who work in the mills ought
on them that should be a Democrat free
democratic society these were very
powerful movements by the 1890s
you know workers were taking over towns
and running them in eastern Pennsylvania
in western Pennsylvania homesteads
famous case well they were crushed by
force it took some time that's where the
final blow was Woodrow Wilson's Red
Scare right after the first world war
which virtually crushed the labor
movement at the same time in the early
19th century the the business world
recognized both in England and the
United States that sufficient freedom
had been won so they could no longer
control people just by violence they had
turned to new means of control the
obvious ones were control of opinions
and attitudes that's the origins of the
massive public relations industry which
is explicitly dedicated to controlling
minds and attitudes the first government
partly was government the first
government Commission was the British
Ministry of Information this is long
before or will he didn't have to invent
it
so the Ministry of Information had as
its goal to control the minds of the
people of the world but particularly the
minds of American intellectuals for very
good reason they knew that if they could
delude American intellectuals into
supporting British policy they could be
very effective in imposing that on the
population of the United States the
British of course were desperate to get
the Americans into the war with a
pacifist population
Woodrow Wilson won the 1960
sixteen election with the slogan peace
without victory and they had to drive a
pacifist population into a population
that bitterly hated all things German
wanted to tear the Germans apart at
blessin Symphony Orchestra couldn't play
Beethoven and they succeeded the Wilson
set up a counterpart to the Ministry of
Information called the Committee on
Public Information again you can guess
what it was and they at least felt that
probably correctly that they had
succeeded in carrying out this massive
change of opinion on the part of the
population and driving the passive the
pacifist population into you know war
mongering fanatics and the people on the
Commission learned a lesson that one of
them was it urbanized who went on to
found be the main guru of the public
relations industry
another one was walter Lippmann who was
the leading progressive intellectual of
the twentieth century and they both had
to drew the same lessons and said so the
lessons were that a weekend we have it
with Lippmann called a new art and
democracy manufacturing consent that's
where it Herman and I took the phrase
from for Bern eyes it was engineering of
consent the conception was that the
intelligent minority who of course is us
have to make sure that we can run the
affairs of public affairs affairs of
state to the economy and so on we're the
only ones capable of doing it of course
and we have to be I'm quoting free from
the roar and the trampling of the
bewildered herd the ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders the general public
they have to they have a role their role
is to be spectators not participants and
every couple of years they're permitted
to choose among one of the responsible
men us
and that consider the John Dewey circle
that took the same view that Dewey
changed his mind
couple years later to his credit but at
that time the Dewey and his circle were
writing that speaking the first world
war that this is the first war in
history that was not organized and
manipulated by the military and the
political figures and so on but rather
it was carefully planned by rational
calculation of the intelligent men in
the community namely us and we thought
it through carefully and decided that
this is the reasonable thing to do for
all kind of benevolent reasons they're
very proud of themselves if there were
people who disagreed like Randolph
Bourne disagreed he was kicked out he
couldn't write in the Dewey height
journals he wasn't killed but he was
just excluded and if you take a look
around the world it was pretty much the
same in the the intellectuals on all
sides were passionately dedicated to the
national cause also it's Germans British
everywhere there were a few fringe of
dissenters like Bertrand Russell who was
a jail the Carl Lee bleep Clifton Rosa
Luxemburg in jail Randolph born
marginalized Eugene Debs in jail for
daring to question the magnificence of
the war in fact Wilson hated him with
such passion that when he fund declared
an amnesty Deb's was left out had to
wait for Warren Harding to release him
and he was the leading labor figure in
the country was a candidate for
president and Socialist Party and so on
but the lesson that came out is you we
believe you you can and of course ought
to control the public and if we can't do
it by force we'll do it by manufacturing
consent by engineering of consent
out of that comes the huge public
relations industry massive industry
dedicated to this incidentally it's also
dedicated to undermining markets the
fact that's rarely noticed but it's
quite obvious it business hates markets
they don't want and you can see it very
clearly the markets if you take an
economics course or based on rational
informed consumers making rational
choices they turn on the television set
and look at the first ad you see it's
trying to create uninformed consumers
making irrational choices that's the
whole point of the huge advertising
industry but also to try to control and
manipulate thought and it takes various
forms in different institutions media do
it one way the academic institutions do
it another way and the educational
system is a crucial part of it is not a
new observation there's actually an
interesting essay by Orwell's which is
not very well known because it wasn't
published it's the introduction to
animal form in the introduction he
addresses himself to the people of
England and he says you shouldn't feel
too self-righteous reading this satire
of the totalitarian enemy because in
free England ideas can be suppressed
without the use of force and he doesn't
say much about it he's access to
sentences well he says the press one
reason is the press is owned by wealthy
men who have every reason not the one
certain ideas to be expressed but the
second reason more important one in my
view is a good education he said if
you've gone to all the good schools you
know Oxford Cambridge and so on
you have instilled into you the
understanding that there are certain
things it wouldn't do to say and I don't
think he went far enough wouldn't do to
think and that's very broad among the
educated classes
that's why overwhelmingly they tend to
support state power and state
and maybe with some qualifications like
say Obama is regarded as a critic of the
invasion of Iraq why because he thought
it was a strategic blunder that puts him
on the same moral level as some Nazi
general who thought that the second
front was a strategic blunder knock off
England first that's called criticism
but and sometimes it's kind of
outlandish for example there was just a
review in The New York Times Book Review
of Glenn Greenwoods new book by Michael
Kinsley
and which bitterly condemned him as a
mostly character assassination didn't
say anything substantive but kenzley did
say that it's ridiculous to think that
there's any repression in the media in
the United States because we can write
quite freely and criticize anything and
he can but then you have to look at what
he says and that's quite interesting
Michael Ken's in the 1980s when the
major the mass local news story was the
u.s. massive u.s. atrocities in Central
America they were horrendous and wasn't
presented that way but that's what was
happening Kinsley was the voice of the
left on television and there were
interesting incidents at one point the
u.s. Southern Command which ran over so
see it was the overseer of these actions
gave instructions to the terrorist force
that they were running in the Nicaragua
called the Contras and they were a
terrorist force they gave them orders to
they said not to duke it out with the
Sandinistas meaning avoid the sand
ernest of the Nicaraguan army and attack
undefended targets like agricultural
cooperatives and young health clinics
and so on and they could do it because
they were the first guerrillas in
history to have high-level
the communications equipment you know
computers and so on the u.s. CLA just
rent-controlled the air totally so they
could send instructions to the terrorist
forces telling them how to avoid the
Nicaraguan army detachments and attack
undefended civilian targets well this
was mentioned you know wasn't publicized
but was mentioned and America's watch
which later became part of Human Rights
Watch was made some protests Michael
Kinsley responded he condemned America's
watch for their emotionalism they said
we have to recognize that we have to
accept the a pragmatic criterion we have
to ask for something like this he said
we have to compare the amount of blood
and misery poured in with the success of
the outcome in producing democracy well
we'll call democracy and if it meets the
pragmatic criterion then terrorist
attacks against civilian targets are
perfectly legitimate which is not a
surprising view in his case he was the
editor than a republic that a republic
supposedly liberal journal was arguing
that we should support Latin American
fascists because there are more
important things than human rights in El
Salvador where they were murdering tens
of thousands of people
that's the Liberals and yeah they can
get in the media no problem and it's at
the unda praised for it regarded with
praise all of this is part of the
massive system of its not that anybody
said that top and plans at all it's just
exactly as our well said it's instilled
into you it's part of a deep
indoctrination system which leads to a
certain way of looking at the world and
looking at Authority which says yes we
have to be subordinate to Authority we
have to believe we're very independent
and free and proud of it as long as we
keep within the limits we are
try to go beyond those limits you're out
but that that system of course is
constant but what's changed is that we
don't produce anything anymore so what
we define is our working class is a
service sector class working in places
like Walmart and the effective forms of
resistance the sit-down strikes you know
the the going back even further in the
middle of the 19th century with the
women in Lowell
I think that was a lot the Wobblies were
behind those textile strikes what are
the mechanisms now and I know you have
written as many anarchists have done
about the importance of the working
class controlling the means of
production taking control and you have a
great quote about how you know Lenin in
the Bolsheviks are right right-wing
deviants I think was that which is of
course exactly right because it was
centralized control destroying the
Soviets given the fact that production
has moved to places like Bangladesh or
southern China what is going to be the
paradigm now and given as you point out
the powerful forces of propaganda and
you touched upon now the security and
surveillance state we are the most
monitored watched photographed
eavesdropped population human history
and you cannot even use the word liberty
when you eviscerate privacy that's what
totalitarian is what is the road we take
now given the paradigm that we have
which is somewhat different from you
know what this country was certainly in
the first half of the 20th century I
think it's pretty much the same frankly
the idea still should be that of the
Knights of Labor those who work in the
mills should on them and there's plenty
of manufacturing going on in the country
and probably there will be more as for
unpleasant reasons that one thing that's
happening right now which is quite
interesting is that
energy prices are going down in the
United States because of the massive
exploitation of fossil fuels which is
going to destroy our grandchildren but
under the you know capitalist morality
the calculus is that profits tomorrow
outweigh the existence of your
grandchildren
that's institutionally based so yes
we're getting lower energy prices and if
you look at the business press they're
very enthusiastic about the fact that we
can undercut manufacturing in Europe
because we'll have lower energy prices
and therefore manufacturing will come
back here and we could even undermine
European efforts at developing
sustainable energy because we'll be so
much will have this advantage at Britain
is saying the same thing that Britain I
was just in England recently as I left
the airport I read The Daily Telegraph
you know I mean newspaper big headline
England is going to begin frack fracking
all over the country even fracking under
people's homes without their permission
and that will make that will allow us to
destroy the environment even more
quickly and we'll have will bring
manufacturing back here same is true
with Asia manufacturing is moving back
to an extent to Mexico and even here as
wages increase in China partly because
of labor struggles it's there's massive
labor struggles in China huge all over
the place and since we're integrated
with them we wouldn't be supportive of
them but manufacturing is coming back
here at both manufacturing and the
service industries can move towards
having those who do the work take over
the management and ownership and control
in fact it's happening in the old Rust
Belt you know Indiana Ohio and so on
there's a significant not huge but
significant growth of worker owned
enterprises they're not huge but they're
substantial around Cleveland other
places the background is interesting in
1977
US Steel the multinational decided to
close down their mills in Youngstown
Ohio the Youngstown is a steel town sort
of built by the Steel Workers and the
main one of the main steel producing
areas
well the Union tried to buy the plants
from US Steel they objected in my view
mostly on class lines they might have
even profited from it but the idea of
worker owned industries don't have much
appeal to corporate leaders which means
bankers and so on it went to the courts
finally the Union lost in the courts but
with enough profit of support they could
have won well the working class just and
the community did not give up they
couldn't get the steel mills but they
began to develop small worker owned
enterprises they've now spread
throughout the region they're
substantial and it can happen more and
more and the same can happen in Walmart
there's a massive effort right now
significant ones to organize a service
workers what they call associates and in
the service industries and these
industries remember depend very heavily
on taxpayer and largesse in all kinds of
ways I mean for example as they say
Walmart's they import goods produced in
China which are brought here on
container ships which were designed and
developed by the US Navy and point after
point where you look you find that the
way the system the system that we now
have is one which is radically
anti-capitalist
radically so I'm
I mentioned one thing the powerful
effort to try to undermine markets for
consumers but there's something much
more striking I mean in the in a
capitalist system the basic principle is
that say if you invest in something and
say it's a risky investment so you put
money into it for a long time maybe
decades and finally after a long time
something comes out that's marketable
for a profit supposed to go back to you
that's not the way it works here it
takes a computers internet lasers micro
electronics containers and GPS in fact
the whole IT revolution there was
taxpayer investment in that for decades
literally decades doing all the hard
creative risky work does the taxpayer
get any of the profit no because that's
not the way our system works so
radically anti-capitalist as it's
radically anti-democratic posed the
markets in favor of concentrating wealth
and power but that doesn't have to be
accepted by the population these are all
there all kinds of forms of resistance
to this can be developed if people
become aware of it well you could argue
that in the election of 2008 with Obama
it wasn't accepted by the population but
what we see repeatedly is that once
elected officials achieve power through
of course corporate financing the
consent of the governed is a kind of
cruel joke
it doesn't poll after poll I mean I sued
Obama over the National Defense
Authorization Act in which you are co
plaintiff and the polling was 97 percent
against this section of the NDAA and yet
the courts which have become wholly
owned subsidiaries of the corporate
state the elected officials the
executive branch and the press which
ignored largely ignored it the only
organ that responsibly covered the case
was ironically the New York Times
we don't have it doesn't matter what we
want it doesn't I mean we and I think
you know that that's the question how do
we affect change when we have reached a
point where we can no longer appeal to
the traditional liberal institutions
that is Karl Popper said once made
incremental or piecemeal reform possible
to adjust the system of course to save
capitalism but now it can't even adjust
the system you know we see we're cutting
well welfare I mean it's perfectly true
that the population is mostly
disenfranchised in fact that's a leading
theme even of academic political science
you take a look at the mainstream
political science so for example a
recent paper that was just published out
of Princeton by Martin Gilliland and
Benjamin page to the leading analysts of
these topics what they point out as they
went through a couple of thousand policy
decisions and found what has long been
known that there was almost no that the
public public attitudes had almost no
effect the public organizations that are
so nonprofit organizations that are
publicly based no effect the outcomes
were determined by a concentrated
private power there's a long record of
that going way back thomas ferguson
political scientist near hearers shown
very convincingly that something as
simple as campaign spending is a very
good predictor of policy that goes back
into the late 19th century
that's right through the New Deal you
know right up till the present and
that's only one element of it and you
take a look at the literature in about
70% of the population what they believe
has no effect on policy at all you get a
little more influence as you go up when
you get to the top which is probably
like 1/10 of 1%
they basically write the legislation I
mean you see this all over I'm going to
take these huge traded with so-called
trade agreements that are being
negotiated trans-pacific and
Atlantic normos agreement kind of
nafta-style agreements their secret
almost they're not secret from the
hundreds of corporate lawyers and
lobbyists who are writing them they know
about it which means that their bosses
know about it and the Obama
administration and the press says look
this has to be secret otherwise we can't
defend our interests yeah our interests
means the interests of the corporate
lawyers and lobbyists were writing the
legislation taking a few pieces who've
been leaked and you see that's exactly
what it is same with the others but
doesn't mean you have to accept it and
there have been changes so they say it
takes a the nude in the 1920s the labor
movement had been practically destroyed
there's a famous book one of the leading
labor historian David Montgomery has a
major book called something like the
fall of the House of labor he's talking
about the 1920s it was it done there had
been a very militant labor movement very
effective farmers movement as well
crushed in 1920 was nothing left
well the 1930s has changed and it
changed because of popular activism but
it also changed because of the breakdown
of capitalism there was a circumstance
that led to the opportunity to do
something but we're living with that
constantly I'm in take the last 30 years
for the majority of the population it's
been stagnation or worse that's a
permanent it's not exactly the deep
depression but it's a kind of a
permanent semi depression for most of
the population that's a plant is plenty
of and kindling out there which can be
lighted and what happened in the 30s is
primarily CIO organizing a militant
actions like sit-down strikes sit-down
strikes very frightening it's a step
before taking over the institution
saying we don't need the bosses and that
there was a cooperative administration
Brazil administration so some
interaction and significant legislation
was passed not not radical but
significant can't underestimate it
and that no it happened again in the 60s
can happen again today so I don't I
don't think that one should abandon hope
in chipping away at the more oppressive
aspects of the society within the
electoral system but it's only going to
happen if there's massive popular
organization which doesn't have to stop
at that it can also be building the
institutions of the future within the
present Society would you say that the
you spoke about propaganda earlier and
the creel Commission and the rise of the
public relations industry that the
capacity to disseminate propaganda is
something that now you virtually can't
escape it I mean it's there in some
electronic form even in a handheld
device does that make that propaganda
more effective well that's kind of an
interesting question I've liked a lot of
people have written a lot about the
media and intellectual propaganda but
there's another question which isn't
studied much how effective is it and
that's kind of when you brought up the
polls it's a striking illustration the
propaganda is you can see from the poll
results that the propaganda has only
limited effectiveness I mean it can
drive a population into terror and fear
and war hysteria like before the Iraq
invasion or 1970 and so on but over time
the public attitudes remain quite
different in fact studies even of what's
called the right wing you know people
who say get the government off my back
that kind of sector they turn out to be
kind of social democratic they want more
spending on health more spending on
education more spending on say
women with dependent children but not
welfare no spending on welfare because
Reagan who is an extreme racist
succeeded in demonizing the notion
welfare so in people's minds welfare
means a rich black woman driving in her
limousine to the welfare office to steal
your money well nobody wants that but
they want what welfare does foreign aid
is an interesting case there's an
enormous propaganda against propagated
foreign aid so because we're giving away
everything to the undeserving people out
there they take a look at public
attitudes a lot of opposition to public
foreign aid very high on the other hand
when you ask people how much do we give
in foreign aid way beyond what we give
when you ask what we should give in
foreign aid far above what we give and
this runs across the board takes a taxes
have been studies of attitude starts
taxes for 40 years overwhelmingly the
population says taxes are much too low
for the rich and the corporate sector
we've got to raise it what happens well
the opposite well it's just exactly Zoar
well said it's instilled into you it's
part of a deep indoctrination system
which leads to a certain way of looking
at the world and looking at Authority
which says yes we have to be subordinate
to Authority we have to believe we're
very independent and free and proud of
it as long as we keep within the limits
we are try to go beyond those limits
you're out well what was fascinating
about I mean the point this to buttress
this point when you took the major
issues of the Occupy movement they were
a majoritarian movement what when you
look back on the Occupy movement what do
you think its failings were its
importance were well I think it's a
little misleading to call it a movement
occupy was a tactic factor brilliant
tactic if I'd been asked in you know a
couple months earlier whether they
should take over the public places I'd
have said it's crazy but it worked
extremely well
and it lit a spark which went all over
the place hundreds of hundreds of places
in the country they were occupy events
it was all over the world I mean I gave
talks in Sydney Australia to the Occupy
movement there but it was a tactic very
effective tactic changed public
discourse not policy it brought issues
to the forefront I think my own feeling
is it's most important contribution was
just to break through the atomization of
the society it's a very atomized Society
there's all sorts of effort to efforts
to separate people from one another to
set if the ideal social unit is you know
you and your TV you know Hannah arrant
raises atomization as one of the key
components of totality exactly and the
Occupy actions broke that down for a
large part of the population people
could recognize that we can get together
and do things for ourselves that we can
have a common kitchen we can have a
place for public discourse that we can
form our ideas and do something now if
those attitude that that's an important
attack on the core of the means by which
the public is controlled so you're not
just an individual trying to maximize
your consumption but there are other
concerns in life and you can do
something about them if those attitudes
can be and associations and bonds can be
sustained move into the directions that
will be important but going back to
occupy it's a tactic tactics have a kind
of a half-life you can't keep doing them
and certainly you can't keep occupying
public places very long so and it was
very successful but it was not in itself
a movement the question is
what happens to the people who are
involved in it do they go on and develop
do they move into communities pick up
community issues do they organize thing
this takes a this businesses a worker
owned industry right here in
Massachusetts not far from here there
was something similar one of the
multinationals decided to close down a
fairly profitable small plant which was
producing the aerospace equipment high
skilled workers and so on but it wasn't
profitable enough so everyone closed it
down the Union wanted to buy it company
refused usual class reasons I think if
the Occupy efforts had been available at
the time they could have provided the
public support for it this happened when
Obama virtually nationalized the auto
industry there were choices the ones one
choice was what he took of course was to
rescue it return it to essentially the
same owners at different phases but the
same class bases and send them back to
doing what they had been doing in the
past producing automobiles there were
other choices and if the something like
the Occupy movement had been around that
sufficient
could have driven the government into
other choices like for example turning
the auto plants over to the working
class and have them produced what the
country needs and we we don't need more
cars that we need mass public
transportation with the United States is
an absolute scandal in this regard I
just came back from Europe so you can
see it dramatically you get on to
European train you where you want to go
in no time the train from Boston to New
York maybe I don't know 20 minutes
faster than when I took it 60 years ago
that's a you go along the Connecticut
Turnpike and the trucks are going faster
than the Train recently in Japan offered
the United States a low-interest loan to
build high-speed rail from Washington to
New York it was turned down of course
but what they were offering was to build
the kind of train that I took in Japan
50 years ago and this is a skin scandal
all over the country well you know a
reconstituted auto industry could have
turned in that direction under worker
and community control I don't think
these things are out of sight and
incidentally they even have so-called
conservative support because there you
know they are within like it there that
within a broader capitalist kind of
what's called capitalist frameworks not
really capitalist and and those are
directions that should be pressed right
now for example the the steel workers
union is trying to establish some kind
of relations with Mondragon the huge
worker owned conglomerate in the Basque
Country in Spain which is very
successful in fact and very includes
industry manufacturing banks hospitals
living quarters is very broad if that
it's not impossible that that can be
brought here and it's it's potentially
radical it's creating the basis for
quite a different society and I think
with things like say occupy the timing
wasn't quite right but if they if the
timing had been a little better and this
goes on all the time so it's always
possible it could have provided a kind
of an impetus to move significant parts
of the socio-economic system in a
different direction and once those
things begin to take off and people can
see the advantages of them can become
quite significant
there are kind of islands like that
around the country so take Chattanooga
Tennessee happens to have a publicly
organized internet system it's by far
the best in the country rapid internet
access for broad parts of the population
I suspect the roots of it probably go
back to the TVA and the New Deal
initiatives well that kind of you know
if that can spread throughout the
country why nots very efficient very
cheap works very well it could undermine
the telecommunications industry and its
oligopoly which would be very good to me
there are lots of possibilities I want
to ask just two last questions first the
fact that we have become a militarized
society something the ante all of the
predictions of the anti-imperialist
league at the end of the 19th century
including Carnegie and Jane Addams hard
to think of them both in the same room
but you go back and read what they wrote
and they were right what how a
militarized society has deformed us
economically Seymour Melman wrote about
this quite well and politically and that
is a hurdle that as we attempt to reform
or we can figure our society we have to
cope with and I wondered if you could
address this military monstrosity that
you have written about quite a bit
well one thing the public doesn't like
it what's called isolationism or one or
another bad word is you know pacifism
was it's just the public recognition
that there's something deeply wrong with
our dedication to the military force all
over the world now of course at the same
time the public is frightened into
believing that we have to defend
ourselves and it's not entirely false a
part of the military system is
generating forces which will be harmful
to us say Obama's a terrorist campaign
campaign the biggest terrorist campaign
in history it's generating potential
terrorists faster than it's killing
suspect you can see it is very striking
what's happening right now in Iraq and
uh the truth of the matter is it is very
evident you could go back to the
nuremberg judgments eyes not telling
anything you don't know
but in nuremberg aggression was defined
as the supreme international crime
differing from other war crimes in that
it includes it encompasses all of the
evil that follows
well us british invasion of iraq is a
textbook case of aggression by the
standards of nuremberg it all behind and
it it one of the things that did one of
the crimes was to ignite a sunni-shiite
the conflict which hadn't been going on
i mean there's you know various kinds of
tensions but iraqis didn't believe that
could ever be a conflict they were
intermarried they lived in the same
places and so on but the invasion set it
off took off on its own by now it's
inflaming the whole region now we're at
the point where sunni a jihadi forces
are actually marching on baghdad and the
Iraqi army is collapsing regi a rocky
arm is just giving away their arm right
there obviously is a lot of
collaboration going on and all of this
is a u.s. crime a u.s. crime if we
believe in the validity of the judgments
against the Nazis and it's kind of
interesting the Robert Jackson chief
prosecutor US Justice it at the tribunal
addressed the tribunal and he pointed
out as he put it that we are giving
these defendants a poison chalice and if
we ever sip from it we have to be
treated the same way or else the whole
thing is a farce and we should recognize
that
but it's not accidental that our
security and surveillance apparatus is
militarized and and and you're right of
course that there is no broad popular
support for this expanding military
adventurism and yet it's the question is
if there is a serious effort to curtail
their power and their budgets they have
mechanisms and we even heard Nancy
Pelosi echo this in terms of how they
play dirty I mean they have in front
they are monitoring on all of the
elected officials as well on the
monitoring but despite everything it's
still a pretty free society and the
recognition by US and British business
back a hundred years ago that they can
no longer control the population by
violence is correct and control by of
attitude and opinion is pretty fragile
as is surveillance it's very different
than sending in the stormtroopers that's
so there's a lot of latitude for people
of relative privilege at least to do all
sorts of things and it's different if
you're a black kid in the ghetto yeah
then you're subjected to state violence
but for a large part of the population
there's plenty of opportunities which
have not been available in the pilot but
the majority or those people are
essentially passive virtually and what
they don't have to they don't have to be
what Hannah arrant when she writes about
the omnipotent policing that were
directed against the stateless including
herself in France so the problem with
building omnipotent policing which we
have done in our marginal neighborhoods
and targeted people of color or can have
their doors kicked in and stopped at
random and thrown in jail for decades
for crimes they didn't commit is that
when you have a societal upheaval you
already have both illegal and a physical
mechanism by which that omnipotent
policing can be quickly inflicted on the
rest I don't think that's true here
I think the time has passed when that
can be done for increasing parts of the
population those who have almost any
degree of privilege the state may want
to do it but then on the power to do it
they can carry out extensive
surveillance monitoring they can be
violent in against parts of the
population that can't defend themselves
undocumented immigrants black kids in
the ghetto and so on but even that's
that it can be undercut for example a
lot of the one of the major scandals in
the United States and Reagan is the huge
incarceration program which is a weapon
against it it's a race war but it's
based on drugs and there is finally
cutting away at the source of this and
the criminalization and the radical
distortion of the way criminalization of
drug use has worked that can have an
effect I mean I think look there's no
doubt that the population is passive
there are lots of ways of keeping them
passive there's lots of ways of
marginalizing and atomizing them but
that's different from stormtroopers it's
quite different and it can be overcome
has been overcome in the past and I
think there are lots of potential
developing which can be used to break
down this system I think it's a very
fragile system including the military
let's just close with climate change you
like I read climate change reports which
well unfortunately that made doom us all
not in the long distance future that
just overwhelms everything as the first
time in human history when we Nora we
have the capacity to destroy the
conditions for decent survival and it's
already happening I mean just take a
look at species destruction a species
destruction now
is estimated to be at about the level of
65 million years ago when an asteroid
hit the earth and ended the period of
the dinosaurs wiped out huge numbers of
species same level today and we're the
asteroid and if and you take a look at
what's happening in the world any better
looking at this from outer space that'd
be astonished I mean there are sectors
of the global population that are trying
to impede the catastrophe there are
other sectors that are trying to
accelerate it and you take a look at who
they are those who are trying to impede
it are the ones we call backward
indigenous populations the First Nations
in Canada you know aboriginals in
Australia the tribal people in India all
over the world are trying to impede it
who's accelerating in the most
privileged advanced so-called advanced
educated populations in the world the US
and Canada right in the lead and we know
why they're all so here's an interesting
case of manufacturers consent and does
it work you took a look at international
polls on global warming
Americans are who are the most
propaganda I've done this I'm this huge
propaganda efforts to make it believe
it's not happening there are little
below the norm but to some effect of the
propaganda its stratified stick a look
at Republicans they're way below the
norm but what's happening in the
Republican Party all along all across
the spectrum is very striking so for
example about two-thirds of Republicans
believe that there were weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq that and all sorts
of other things you know so so it's it
stratified but there but there's some
impact of the propaganda but not
overwhelming
most of the population still regards it
as a serious problem that there's
actually an interesting article about
this in the Columbia Journalism Review
is just a pure current issue you know
the lead critical review of journalism
they attribute this to what they call
the doctrine of fairness in the media
doctrine of fairness says that if you
have an opinion piece by ninety five
ninety seven percent of the scientists
you have to pair it with an opinion
piece by the energy the corporations
does that be fair balanced there isn't
any such doctrine like if you have a an
opinion piece denouncing Putin as the
new Hitler for the Nexen de Crimea you
don't have to balance it with an opinion
piece saying that a hundred years ago
the United States took over southeastern
Cuba at the point of a gun and is still
holding it though it has absolutely no
justification other than to try to
undermine Cuban development whereas in
contrast what do you think of Putin
there's reasons you don't have to have
that when you have to have fair and
balanced when it affects the concerns of
private power period but try to get an
article in the Columbia Journalism
Review point that out although it's
transparent so all these things are
there but they can be overcome and
they'd better be on let this isn't
unless there's a sharp reversal in
policy unless we here in the advanced so
called advanced societies can gain the
consciousness of the indigenous people
of the world we're in deep trouble our
grandchildren are going to suffer from
it
and I think you would agree that's not
going to come from the power elite
certainly it's up to us absolutely and
it's urgent
it is thank you very much
