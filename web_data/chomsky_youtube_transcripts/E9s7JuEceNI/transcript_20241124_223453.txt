a project like this which attempts to uh
bring support from vast numbers of
people in the US for the nonviolent
actions that are attempting to break the
siege in Gaza are even more important
than a stance that uh uh the US might
take as a
government it's critically important
that the American citizens should make a
powerful statement saying we don't
accept this we don't accept our
participation in these crimes and
atrocities it's about Ordinary People
saying you won't do the job so we're
going to do it and we're going to do it
with the means we have which
is to get together to raise money to buy
a
boat to go on a human rights Mi Mission
so that we
can uphold human rights and
international law when ships are on the
high seas trying to go to Gaza it's
utterly illegal to touch those ships um
the flotilla has an absolute right uh
legally to go into Gaza this is an
inhuman Siege of a population of well
over a million and a half people who are
cut off from the outside world prevented
from normal trading relations normal
travel normal importing and exporting of
goods the image uh and the notion of a
flotilla of a ship being able to
breach a seab border a maritime and
break a maritime Siege successfully make
it to Gaza is really an
overwhelming one uh I think to all
Palestinians and does send this immense
message of Hope and possibility this is
um one of many wakeup calls um to people
around the world and specifically in
this country where we're um the number
one funders of the Israeli military
occupation the freedom fertilla is
trying to do what any decent human being
should do break a criminal Siege provide
a fraction small fraction of the
desperately needed U uh assistance
that's that Gaza required something like
this action has terrific potential to
capture imagination and to enter into at
least push the questions into the
general discussion why should Gaza be
subjected to this Siege that's why the
strength of individuals doing this on
their own on a boat human beings banded
together and saying enough is enough
this blockade of people Goods food
Building Material blockade of a hopes of
a people is enough already and we're
going to do something about
it this is about an indigenous
population that was violently
dispossessed of their land violently
displaced from their homes violently and
structurally prevented return to those
homes every International lawyer
acknowledges the UN acknowledges it's an
occupied territory a million and a half
people imprisoned in Gaza I can't think
of a parallel in uh modern history of a
million and a half people being
imprisoned this way we as United States
citizens have a great deal to do with
making possible and facilitating the
occupation that has turned Gaza into a
prison there is still a mer time Siege
being enforced on Gaza there is an
aerial uh Siege on Gaza and there still
is a land Siege on Gaza it is a Siege on
the most basic freedoms of human beings
it prevents them from being able to farm
it prevents them from being able to
study it prevents them from being able
to live with their families this is what
the siege is really about almost
everything that we send to Gaza is made
in Munitions plants in this country it's
time that we as concerned
citizens began to send to the people of
Gaza something other than weapons all of
this Weaponry the United States has sent
to Israel these are United States
taxpayer dollars that go to Israel as
the first recipient of United States
forign and so to have a ship carrying an
American flag that is coming uh solely
for their solidarity would really be an
awesome and unprecedented
act the policy of a president who
started off by saying um that he was
going
to offer a new beginning as far as
dealing with the Palestine issue has
been almost indistinguishable from the
policy of his predecessors well it's a
very great irony because the promise of
the Obama presidency was this radical
change in um so many of our policies
that had been in place in this
bipartisan consensus for so long and of
course virtually none of them has
changed and certainly nothing in the
Middle East or towards Israel has
changed at all so I think it's a way of
demanding that he fulfill the pretty
words of of his campaign naming the US
vot to Gaza The Audacity Of Hope is a
wonderful spin-on language it works to
appropriate language that's been used in
the mainstream to force an American
constituency to challenge their
conception of what power looks like when
I hear those words I think of all of the
phrases and hopes and yearnings that
Obama appropriated as a candidate and
betrayed as a president there's a lot of
links to be made between the The
Audacity Of Hope and resistance and
resilience coming out of Palestine and
the audacity coming out of communities
here to say that we have the audacity to
believe in ourselves that we can change
our really foul situation is very good
news for the world what I think The
Audacity Of Hope is trying to do is put
meaning back into the expression The
Audacity Of
Hope the children of Gaza need to know
that there are people in the world who
love them I want them to know that there
are adults you know there are mothers
their fathers their other children there
are people who actually love them who
care about them as if they were their
own children and in the larger scheme of
things they are our children it's
ordinary people who change history
Ordinary People are responsible for the
victory against apar and ordinary people
uh all over the world will support the
Palestinians in their quest uh for
Freedom whenever I talk to friends in
Gaza the one thing they stress is the um
import
of international solidarity of feeling
they haven't been forgotten having lived
in Gaza for many years and my parents uh
having lived through uh operation
castled I can tell you that what got
them through that psychologically was
our communication and in in that sense I
think that the flist to Gaza can have
the same sort of impact and communicate
to people that there is action there are
people doing things to try to change
this very abnormal reality there's a
spirit of saying we don't just bow down
in front of Injustice and that is the
tradition in this country of challenging
overwhelming uh Power that is is doing
Injustice this is the freedom ride of
this era to get on this boat make it to
Gaza make it to the West Bank and
understand your your political lineage
which is to oppose with every drop of
your blood this kind of Oppression of
anybody anywhere on Earth
