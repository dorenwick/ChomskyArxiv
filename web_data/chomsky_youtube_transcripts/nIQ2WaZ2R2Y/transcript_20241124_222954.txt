welcome to green and red grappy Politics
the scrappy people
a regular podcast on radical
environmental and anti-capitalist
politics brought to you by Bob the
Zanker and Scott Parkins
podcast and Scott is not here today uh
but we are as always really happy and
humbled to have with us no Chomsky on
January 7th 27 1973 the United States
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam North
Vietnam the provisional revolutionary
government in the South and the Republic
of South Vietnam signed an agreement to
end uh U.S participation in the Vietnam
War and so we're coming up on the 50th
anniversary of that and I think this is
a period of the war that most people
don't know as well as the earlier period
especially let's say up to tat so we're
talking with somebody who was like
deeply involved in uh criticizing the
war protesting against the war studying
the war writing about the war Professor
Noel Chomsky to start um the other day
in an email you mentioned how you found
out the war had ended and I thought it
was an interesting story so if you want
to tell that it just began
well that was
in 1975
Howard Zinn and I were
giving one of her
innumerable joint performances that
happened to be at Brandeis University
we were the two of us were giving talks
against the war
and in the middle of the panel a guy
raced in from
the back and shouted the wars over
um so that was dramatic we've both been
involved in it very intensively for
about 15 years and
I mean the way the war is described here
even in scholarship you know better than
I do it started in
1965 when the U.S started bombing North
Vietnam that's a convenient narrative
for the United States makes it look as
though we're defending South Vietnam
from North Vietnamese aggression
but the war was against South Vietnam
overwhelmingly North Vietnam was often a
periphery
but that's inconvenient for U.S
propaganda we're not supposed to be the
kind of country that attacks and
destroys and massacres other people
which is what we do so we need some
other framework we're defending them
from an attack from somewhere else
that's much more convenient has nothing
to do with the facts but that's never
been an impediment the war really began
when Jonathan goes back to 1954 when
1950 when the U.S
supported the French and their effort to
reconquer their
former Colony
1954 there was a settlement
International settlement the U.S
rejected it and established a
client stayed in the south in violation
of the agreements
next half a dozen years about
maybe 70 or 80 000 people were killed in
the South under the Crimes of the U.S
back government finally it led to
resistance then the U.S went to war
against South Vietnam openly under
Kennedy 61 and 62 sharp escalation of
the war
authorized Napalm chemical warfare to
destroy crops and livestock programs to
drive huge numbers of people into what
amount of the concentration camps in
order to protect them from the
guerrillas who they were supporting as
U.S intelligence knew very well
U.S Air Force started bombing South
Vietnam under South Vietnamese markings
but didn't fool South Vietnamese at
least maybe Americans but that sharp
escalation was in 6162 that continued to
expanded right through the Kennedy years
they finally found they weren't able to
control the U.S under Kennedy been the
there was the threat of a peaceful
settlement a stress threat the U.S
imposed regime the gem regime had had
enough of it they were looking for a
settlement
with the north that would end it to the
Kennedy administration was quite upset
about this thing organized the coup to
throw them out they actually got killed
in the course of the coup
installed a hawkish general official key
who would follow U.S orders and keep the
war going that's shortly before the
Kennedy assassination
shows along with many other things that
Kennedy was a Super Hawk dedicated to
continuing the war until victory was
very explicit about that there's a whole
mythology that's been constructed but
totally refuted by the evidence I don't
have to talk to you about this I just
had a long conversation which ever said
morally about this and that that's what
I kept saying where's your evidence so
yeah it doesn't matter when you have a
conclusion that you have to believe it
doesn't matter what the facts are that's
well-known human weakness but
the framework in which it's always
discussed here is a war against the
North
and that completely falsifies it all the
way through up to the Ted offensive
January 1968.
that was a war not against North Vietnam
but against the South
the North Vietnam there were North
Vietnamese forces but they were at the
perimeter perimeter they were in fact
drawing U.S forces away from the center
and other places if you look at the
middle but they we weren't fighting
North Vietnam it was a massive assault
against the South
which actually won the U.S defeated the
National Liberation Front which was
crushed by the the Southern Independent
Southern forces they were pretty much
crushed what was left was The Horde
liners
uh
North Vietnam in the United States so
then 73
agreement
if you look at the 73 agreement it
actually set up two parallel governments
in South Vietnam
the U.S backed Saigon government and the
provision of prg provisional
revolutionary government which was the
remnants of the national liberations run
and they were to be parallel and
equivalent
U.S never accepted that the U.S
continued to support
Kissinger continued to support the
Saigon government hoping that somehow
they'd be able to hang on and U.S would
be able to violate the Paris agreements
and establish its uh to own government
in the South it's not the way it's
portrayed but that's what happened and
finally it collapsed
much like the Afghan regime Iraqi regime
I mean it's very kind of strikingly
similar to those
it's very hard to set up a
mercenary Army and an occupied country
you can give them plenty of arms and
they can outweigh the opposition and
armaments but they're not going to fight
that way like take a look at what
happened in Iraq
the United States
armed and trained in Iraqi Army
a lot of equipment
as soon as a couple of truckloads of
Isis gorillas came
racing towards them in pickup trucks the
officers fled and the Army fled and the
only thing that saved Iraq was
iranian-backed Shiite militias
Afghanistan as soon as the U.S is
pulling out the whole thing collapsed
it's very hard to do you can't can't
really blame them can't get people to
fight for a an imposed a foreign imposed
government that just doesn't work
when Vietnam was kind of like then well
I think it's also important because you
know the agreement is is finally signed
in 1973 but there had been negotiations
between Kissinger and leilato
um in you know 1970 and 71 where they
more or less established the framework
that was the final settlement yet the
U.S kept kind of moving that uh the
North Vietnamese made concessions and uh
Nguyen van too kept scuttling them you
know 69 reservations four no's and so
um you know every time this happened you
know if you want to talk a little bit
about Nixon and Kissinger's approach to
this they kind of had negotiations that
came to these agreements much earlier
than the war ended and they themselves
reneged on them
yeah
they were forced into the agreements
always tried to evade them by seeing if
more massive Force more violence could
somehow keep the U.S client regime in
place
some of the worst atrocities were in 69
and 70. the accelerated pacification
campaign was called him horrendous
atrocities in the south I mean milai was
a kind of a minor footnote to them but
this was all part of and in fact there's
reasonable evidence not proven but
plausible that
Nixon and Kissinger were actually
planning to use nuclear weapons if
nothing else worked and we're deterred
by the huge popular mobilizations here
in 1969 which probably blew the country
up
Dan Ellsberg and others have written
about this then had been on the inside
he was pretty close to planning
and uh but they certainly never kept
hoping to the last minute that they
could somehow pull something out
I actually want to ask you about that
the protest in the anti-war movement as
well because you were you were so deeply
involved in that
um you know some of the biggest protests
occurred you know with Nixon the
mobilization and the moratorium the vdaw
um did you see yourself getting kind of
a better response
by the Nixon years that you had before
because there are a lot fewer American
soldiers there I mean Nixon withdraws
you know they're down to I think 47 000
by 1971. so when you were talking about
the war saying hey things are still
going on you know it's still brutal the
Easter offensive the the bombing
linebacker were people listening to you
or did they kind of were they already
kind of moving away because there were
fewer American troops there
well I don't really think that was the
issue a lot of people say that I mean
the the troops were withdrawn
and but the reason was the Army was
falling apart the top grass wanted them
out
they just weren't following orders they
were
getting high on drugs shooting officers
the United States learned a lesson
that all other Imperial Powers had known
before
you don't fight a colonial war with
draftees
the colonial war is murderous brutal you
gotta go in and Slaughter civilians the
kids who you pick up off the streets are
not going to be able to do this
so so the Army infect was falling apart
the breasts really wanted them out they
were afraid the Army would go and the
United States shifted at that point to
what amounts to a mercenary Army the
poor it's called a volunteer army
privileged young kids don't volunteer
people who have no alternative May
volunteer for whatever benefits they're
getting and also the use of straight
mercenaries we call them contractors but
they're basically mercenaries South
African killers and others
that's the British and the French style
they didn't send draftees they used the
French Foreign Legion professional
Killers
gurk has trained to be Killers you know
see boys
but not the young French and British
civilians who you take out off the
streets it's just not
the cafe to colonial war that went and
the United States finally learned it and
shifted to a
professional and mercenary forces
and Reliance on
bombing from a distance and Special
Forces who are trained for these kinds
of things
that's much more the traditional
Imperial Style
of course we have heavy weapons that
British and the French never had
okay in 1972 the kind of I think the
standard story and if you read like I've
been reading some of the kind of 50th
Anniversary Reflections recently
and most of them say well you know the
United States kind of forced the the
Northerners to to concede through
especially through the Christmas
bombings which Roger Morris who resigned
at the time at the NLC called calculated
barbarism I think the United States was
flying around the clock b52s for 11 days
and Christmas period of 1972. so we have
this idea that that's you know that was
successful right that that forced uh the
northern Vietnamese that can see and you
know to have basically agree to
something they'd agreed to two years
earlier but do you want to talk a little
bit just about you know kind of the
reality of what those Christmas bombings
meant
well the reality was the hope that with
sufficient force and violence
we could compel
uh the North Vietnamese to accept a
U.S imposed regime in the south
the South had already been devastated
there were almost no constraints on the
bombing of the South
which was much more horrifying or say
the bombing of Laos
I mean maybe the most intense in history
totally defenseless scattered population
but who cared you know
in fact if you look back at the bombing
of Laos
Fred Branson the main investigator dug
this out turned out that the U.S
officials conceded and sent a testimony
that the reason for the bomb intense
bombing of those was that there was a
bombing halt in North Vietnam so they
had nothing to do with the bombers
so they sent them to destroy the
population of rural Northern Laos and
poor peasants have Muslim didn't even
know they were in Laos uh most intense
bombing in history I
interviewed a lot of the refugees when
they were driven out by a CIA mercenary
Army but uh
it's a real Horror Story Fred's voices
from The Plains of Lowe's has given
Cambodia is probably even worse but it's
never been investigated
in Cambodia 1971
Kissinger transmitted
loyally transmitted the off orders from
his half-drunk boss
the orders were
uh massive bombing campaign in Cambodia
anything that flies against anything
that moves
I don't think you can find a call for
genocide like that
in the archival record
my Troy I can't find one anything that
flies against anything that moves
that's the bombing of Cambodia it's
called a secret bombing not a secret to
the cambodians secret meaning we don't
report it that's secret
but uh
like the secret bombing of those and the
bombing of South Vietnam which you
couldn't avoid reporting because they
were troops and reporters there but
still the pretense always has been we're
fighting the North Vietnamese and
defending South Vietnam from then
that's why when you look at the
commentary today we'll hear more of it
in a couple weeks at the anniversary
what it is is the United States was
engaged in a costly failed mission to
bring democracy
to Vietnam and to defend the South
Vietnamese that's the official line
a few years ago when um Ken Burns did
the the PBS documentary that was so
popular you know that was the basis of
it the United States uh had to preserve
South Vietnam which had been invaded by
North Vietnam and uh you know these were
good men with the best of intentions who
just made a mistake
and I know even at the time you know the
anywhere movement wasn't saying that
they didn't say this is a mistake and
you're good guys
well what's kind of interesting in 1975
When The War ended
everybody of course had to make a
statement about it and I published an
article at the time running through the
statements right to left
they were the there were two types
basically they were the Hawks who said
we were stabbed in the back if we'd
fought harder we could have won then
there were the doves they're much more
interesting
people like at the extreme people like
Anthony Lewis of the New York Times
committed left liberal commentator the
extreme and the media his commentary was
that the United States entered the war
with benign efforts to do good
you don't have to have evidence for that
that's a an axiom it's true just like
two points
my dog does my brain
the United States did it it was with
benign intentions but um
then he goes on to say by 1969 it was
clear that it was a disaster we couldn't
bring
democracy to South Vietnam at a cost
acceptable to us
so that's the extreme of so it's between
that and if we'd fought harder we could
have won quite interestingly at the same
time independently there were studies of
public opinion going on
Chicago Council of Foreign Relations
didn't was doing intensive
investigations of public attitudes on
all sorts of things and of course they
asked questions about Vietnam
1975
70 percent of the population said the
war was not a mistake it was
fundamentally wrong and immoral
that's the American population
that remained steady for about 15 years
as long as they were asking the
questions
finally at the end of this period
the director of the study John really a
very good social scientist
I said
why did people keep saying that the war
was fundamentally wrong and immoral and
he gave an answer
he said because two of too many American
soldiers died
Maybe
or maybe people thought it's
fundamentally wrong and immoral to
slaughter and Destroy another country
maybe could have been possible to find
out by asking the question but that was
never done because that couldn't be you
know uh well those are questions that
haven't been explored and won't be
explored they're not the right kind
it's like asking um
did the Iraqis uh uh thank us for
liberating them well
you don't ask that question because if
you do you get the wrong answers yeah
um this is also a war which has you know
kind of the Liberals the Democrats
fingerprints all over it which I think
is another piece of it that too often
people today kind of forget that Kennedy
and LBJ really were the architects of
the major escalation and and the use of
Firepower and when you because I know
you talked about that and even in you
know some of your major essays like the
responsibility of intellectuals you
talked about that how did that go over
because you're in Cambridge you know you
have you know this is kind of the
Kennedy's backyard George Bundy the
bundies are there when you talked about
the the complicity of the Democrats and
liberals and how they were kind of
responsible for this how how did people
respond to that you know did uh you
catch a lot of catch a lot of Hell For
That
well I was living in Boston at the time
in Cambridge
which was the center of American
liberalism probably the most liberal
city in the country
we couldn't have public demonstrations
against the war
because they would be broken up
violently
Often by students
and liberal Boston it wasn't until
when we we tried to have demonstrations
of the Boston Common the usual place
couldn't do that be broken up we tried
to have him in churches churches were
attacked
this was going on until
late 1966
early 1967 began to switch
at that point
South Vietnam had practically been
destroyed
let me take a look at
the commentary of Bernard foal the most
respected
military historian Vietnamese specialist
the one
who the U.S government actually
respected most to McNamara described him
as the one
non-government scholar who they really
had to take seriously
by the time we were able to have a
demonstration and
Boston
he was writing
he was a hook himself and no Dove he was
but he cared about the Vietnamese
he was writing that Vietnam as a
culture and historical entity may not
survive the most intense
the tech that an area this size has ever
been subjected to he was talking about
South Vietnam
well by that point with over half a
million Americans
these we were finally able to have a
public demonstration without it being
broken up that's liberal Cambridge uh
then came the picture that we've already
described
benign intentions
go and awry because of mistakes uh the
uh it was a war we tried to protect
South Vietnam from the north and
couldn't manage to do it yeah the usual
story we'll hear more about this in a
couple of weeks it's all totally
falsified and of course Kennedy is is no
huge
public movement mostly on the left
trying to
glorify Kennedy as someone who really
was a secret of in his pronouncements
and his actions he was brutally hawkish
but that was just concealing the secret
Dove within who had these hidden
intentions to pull out and to move
towards the peace and Justice in the
world and so on
for the past year I've been involved in
this world and it's really startling I
mean there you know people have said you
don't understand that Kennedy was an
Anti-Imperialist and you're defending
it's it's shocking that there's this
immense uh documentary record what
Kennedy did in Vietnam Cuba Africa
everywhere Brazil you know Guinea and
yet they just ignore it it's it's
stunning actually uh if you really look
at Kennedy seriously
probably the most
aside from Vietnam
the most dangerous things he did were in
our backyard Latin America in 1962
uh Kennedy
shifted the mission of the Latin
American Military which we of course
control
shifted their mission from hemispheric
defense which was a relic from the
second world war shifted it to internal
security
well in Latin America internal security
means something
it means
I'll give a description that was given
by Kennedy's chief of counter-insurgency
Charles mesling
said this was a shift from
tolerating their opacity and brutality
of the Latin American Military to direct
and active participation in crimes of
the kind that were carried out by
himmler's just stoppa that's Kennedy's
chief of counter-insurgency which is a
pretty fair description of what happened
right after that started a wave of
military dictatorships supported in fact
sometimes instituted by the United
States
first one was Brazil
plan during the Kennedy administration
took place right after the assassination
the greatest victory for freedom in the
mid 20th century according to
Kennedy's Ambassador
Neo-Nazi torture regime wonderful he
also added it's very good for American
Investment which is true it was then
comes Uruguay Chile Pinochet Argentina
whole raft Central America under Reagan
um
Decades of
horrifying atrocities well it was set
off by the 1962 decision and see
we have a you have a conservative mind
maybe it's criticism I'm not sure
they're not very precise about it
hi you're watching and listening to the
green and red podcast and today we're
talking with Noam Chomsky about the 50th
anniversary of the peace treaty that
ended the Vietnam War Vietnam is one of
our big interests here and we've been at
the Forefront especially in the public
interest given to the JFK conspiracy
theories

back to our interview with Noam Chomsky
but uh unless you know it takes a Cuba
I'm in Cuban uh
Kennedy troyed an invasion win that
field the Kennedy administration just
went crazy
they launched a major terrorist War not
discussed here but it was a serious
terrorist War
sanctions to punish Cuba from
resisting U.S Invasion can't do that
kind of thing
affect the state department back in the
60s said
the problem of Castro is the threat of
Castro is Cuba's successful Defiance of
U.S policies going back to the 1820s
Monroe Doctrine declared their intention
to dominate the hemisphere can't have
successful Defiance event
to a major terrorist war or sanctions
strangling the society goes on right up
till today
gotta punish those things Cubans need
syringes for vaccines we're going to
prevent Europe from sending them to them
because if they do we'll
punish Europe with their control of the
International Financial system
let's go straight back to the Kennedy
years no change
in fact Clinton was one of the worst
Olympic yeah
um the the qubits have always kind of
thanked the Vietnamese they said you
know if it weren't for Vietnam we would
have probably been receiving
those attacks from the United States why
do you think I mean it could have
happened in the post 45 era as you
pointed out the United States was
involved everywhere from Greece to
Indonesia Iran Guatemala you name it you
know the Middle East why do you think
Vietnam became the place where it
actually fought this huge War you know
where it didn't do that in other places
what was the importance of Vietnam in
their minds
well the importance of Vietnam was
didn't succumb
so Guatemala
uh under Eisenhower
the U.S
threatened and initiated an invasion and
they collapsed over Iran under
Eisenhower
over through the government
Indonesia was a little tougher
Eisenhower tried in 1958 to intervene in
Indonesia to
destroy the parliamentary government
Institute a military regime but it
failed it wasn't until 1965.
when General saharta carried out a
military coup
support of the United States slaughtered
nobody knows how many maybe a million
people
destroyed the main political party
it was greeted with Euphoria in the
United States
New York it was described accurately
New York Times described it as a
staggering blood death
Time Magazine devoted a whole issue to
the bloody massacre
for all praising it
hope where there once was none you know
gleam of light in Asia New York Times
James Richmond
because it opened the country it
destroyed an independent
government that was not following orders
and it opened the place up to U.S
investment and exploitation
so the fact that they and this went on
when suharta visited
Washington in 1995 Clinton he was
welcomed as Clinton said our kind of guy
you know
Slaughters and tortures and opens the
place up to
U.S investment
Vietnam was different didn't succumb
so got out of hand
after let's say Ted it was pretty clear
that the United States probably wasn't
going to succeed in Vietnam yet it
continued fighting it it uh
significantly escalated the air War
including in Laos and kempachia
um and people like Frank snap who was a
CIA agent said they they wanted a decent
interval before they lost right others
are suggested the United States just
wanted to inflict maximum damage on
Vietnam so that you know even if it did
win it really couldn't rebuild and I
just wondered what what why you think
the United States continued after it was
fairly clear that they weren't going to
to succeed militarily
well there is what
Dan Ellsberg called the
Quagmire theory he was on the inside for
most of this period right at the top of
the planting beer said once you're in
you just can't get out you lose
credibility you know then in fact some
of the top
uh officials said that John McNaughton
and
80 percent of the reason we're here is
it look bad if we get out you know so
maybe that's part of it but I think at
least on the part of
Henry Kissinger Nixon was probably too
drunk to know what was going on but
Kissinger was functioning and
seems that he thought that the U.S could
still somehow manage to install a client
regime and that's why
he did not accept the 73
agreements but insisted that the South
Vietnamese government was the Saigon
government was the sole legitimate
government of South Vietnam 73 agreement
said there were two parallel governments
prg and Saigon Kissinger never accepted
then so it looks as if maybe it was a
decent gender that's standard line or
maybe it was a hope that maybe you could
get more if he kept fighting
the the agreement the United States
meant very remote been bombing right not
you know then of course that's anything
the agreement also included provisions
on on what would happen after the treaty
was signed and um again that the
American story which I think the media
picked up was that the the Vietnamese
were violating the agreement when in
fact the United States was continuing to
send weapons and all kinds of funding
right to uh to the southerners
yeah the United States and North Vietnam
violated the agreements
South Vietnam which was the target of
the attack
they were not even part of it
I think it's it's striking um there's a
good site which has maps of the Vietnam
War and one of the maps is bombing runs
in Vietnam a huge majority I think close
to two-thirds of the attacks occurred
below the 17th parallel so the United
States was attacking its so-called Ally
which I've never seen before in military
history where you attack you know the
country you're there to save
was almost all in the South the worst I
mean the saturation bombing of
heavily populated areas by B-52s that
was in the South deep in the south in
fact Mekong Delta
or in Quincy Province you know smashed
I mean North Vietnam was bad enough I
visited and it was pretty bad but uh
nothing like South Vietnam or Laos or
Cambodia which is coming around Hanoi
the United States was not able to bomb
too intensively because they're foreign
embassies and European embassies people
watching the
in 1970 Christmas bombings broke that
barrier but before that they had
been I mean I was in North Vietnam in
1970
when you were in Hanoi you could see the
effects of bombing but as soon as you
went into the countryside
it turned into moonscapes
when you visited Vietnam and returned
did anybody try to talk to you any any
kind of officials or uh you know kind of
any any secret does you know it was kind
of interesting
oh yeah
Coral Weiss who was
one of the major people in the
International Peace movement
and was keeping International contacts
with the Vietnamese and others she
called me up one evening and said look
would you be able to go to North Vietnam
to visit during a bombing pause
so I said I'd work it out about an hour
later
I got a call from the state department
saying can we help you with your trip to
North Vietnam
oh and what they were after was if they
the good guys help out with everything
then when we come out they can brief we
can they can brief us and we'll tell
them about North Vietnam obviously what
they wanted but they were very helpful
they said yes please let us help you in
every way and
I didn't exactly know why I was being
invited it turned out that they wanted
me to lecture
at the with the ruins of the Polytechnic
University they hadn't had the everyone
was been scattered out to the
countryside for years and they wanted to
hear what's going on and any field I
knew the slightest step thing about like
one guy asked me what's Norman wheeler
writing these days
one of the interesting things there
was it has to do with U.S planning
I did meet with the higher-ups in the
politburo some of the top people want to
and others they made it very clear and
explicit
that their enemy was not the United
States it was China
they said yes you guys are smashing us
to Pieces but you're going to go away
China's not going to go away
nobody in the higher planning level in
the United States could ever understand
then
I mean it was obvious why
it's become obvious in the post-war
period
but had to be with Dean Russ called the
sign of Soviet conspiracy well Russian
China were practically at War and
Vietnam didn't want either of them you
know they were the enemy in fact the
first day I was there
I went with and Dick Fernandez
the three of us were taken to a war
museum in Hanoi
we were subjected to a three-hour
lecture on the wars that Vietnam had
fought against China a thousand years
ago
telling us very clearly
that's what we're worried about
they're going to still be there when you
go away
if any top American planner had had the
brains to understand this they would
have treated the whole thing totally
differently but this is such an
ideologically rigid country
that you just have to stick within the
framework of official propaganda no
matter what's staring you in the face
you're seeing it right now with the
insane russophobia but it's common
yeah I've been thinking about that to
discuss negotiating with with Russia
um and you know again you have a lot of
establishment figures doing that it
reminded me of people like morgenthau
and canon in the Vietnam era but you're
you're labeled a puppet of Putin and all
that kind of stuff and it really
although now you're starting to see like
Mark Miller the chair of the joint she's
a staff even saying okay we have to
negotiate but yeah it's incredibly rigid
that's true effective it's interesting
that if you read foreign fairs main
establishment jerk Journal
they're running
pretty conciliatory articles that people
on the left could never get away with
right not just let's negotiate but let's
uh it was a recent article by uh
saying a well-known specialist That's a
good piece yeah I don't have to
negotiate we have to integrate Russia
back into the International System as a
participating equally participating
member because just too important for
the future and if you and I tried to say
that it would be careful oh yeah zubach
is pretty good I've always I've read it
for a long time and he's always a
helpful and enlightening you mentioned
China man good I think this is important
too because again you know this is not
really kind of part of the American
history of it but you know in 1979 with
Carter and brzezinski's encouragement
um the Chinese invaded Vietnam
thank you
punish it um for driving out the Khmer
Rouge yes the U.S was
passively supporting the Khmer Rouge at
the time and you recorder and Brzezinski
supported a Chinese Invasion to punish
Vietnam for driving them out of Cambodia
ending the atrocities in fact the United
States then went on to support
the
basically the Khmer Rouge government did
a different name at the time Democratic
kombucha support them as the
representatives of the Cambodian people
they had the position in the United
Nations which the U.S supported
basically also the U.S was turning to
helping them regroup and re-arm and so
on that
went on for a couple of years well into
the Reagan Administration
Gene Kirkpatrick defended them at the
U.N I remember that
um you know that speaks a lot to the
kind of post-war Vietnam I know Gabriel
Coco has written a lot about this who
was you know very active and you know
visited Vietnam frequently but he wrote
really critically of them uh uh you know
after the war ended now they have these
massive occupation costs in kempuchia
they have this war against Vietnam but I
think one of the first things it sounds
like they did was to kind of abandon the
people who made the revolution possible
the workers the veterans and you know um
they couldn't get on I mean the United
States continued the war right it it
reneged on uh a reparations agreement
that was in a codisle that Nixon had
made uh it prevented the IMF and World
Bank and other uh International
institutions from helping Vietnam out so
what was the situation like there in the
80s after the war it sounds uh it was it
was fairly Bleak and desperate
yeah
Gabe cook it was a very good historian
in new Vietnam very well he was very
critical of them but my feeling is
a somewhat misunderstood
the
Vietnamese from the beginning
I mean they were not a Libertarian
socialists they were tough they were
going to run a tough
States under their control
and
the fact that they
it wasn't a working class Revolution it
was a popular defense against attack
and the
leadership I don't think had any
dedicated socialist ideals not in my
view
but
they fought a war to defend themselves
and to gain power
what they did afterwards the main
popular forces in Vietnam in my opinion
were the national liberations run of
South Vietnam which was destroyed
North Vietnam didn't want them the
United States didn't want them
and they were the virtually nothing
survived of them
when the war ended we kept hearing that
there was now a Vietnam syndrome and the
United States was not going to do this
kind of thing anymore it was going to
abandon these kind of colonial projects
um you know and and yet you know here we
are today with this massive in in uh
investment in Ukraine and saber Adam
against China and all kinds of other
stuff you know before that Century what
if if there were so-called lessons of
Vietnam for the United States you know
what do you think they were
well the lesson for the United States
was quite clear
first what we were recently talked about
you don't use a civilian Army to fight
colonial wars
so I can listen
don't get involved in massive troop
commitments
fight your Wars on the cheap take say
the Ukrainian War
for the United States it's just a
a blessing
for a small fraction small fraction of
the U.S defense budget we're practically
destroying the army of our major
opponent
Russia the major military opponent is
Russia a lot of their military forces
soldiers or months are being destroyed
for a tiny cost us I'm at a big cost in
Ukrainian lives but who cares about that
uh the U.S policy quite officially is
got to keep fighting the war to severely
weaken Russia well we're doing that
we're severely weakening Russia
Ukraine is devastated it's kind of
collateral damage
but people starving in Africa well what
can you do about that and yeah the work
going uh severely and it's it's on the
cheap it's a very small expenditure
and the U.S
interventions in the following years
were
basically little cost to the United
States plenty of costs overthrow the
Government of Chile and put in a
murderous brutal dictatorship
it's a benefit to the United States
investment
take over the economy and so on it
doesn't cost anything
we've been going on so I appreciate your
time
I just got a couple more things one and
this is something you brought up and
I've since written about and probably
yeah different view of it like the
neocon intellectuals like Norman
padhuritz
uh talk about it as in his words the
sickly inhibition against the use of
military force
we've got to get over that sickly
which really never I mean they use
proxies but that that's the thing I I've
often argued there really was no Vietnam
syndrome you know
uh that didn't really stop anybody one
of the things you've written and I've
written about and I catch hell for it
but I think you're right is you've kind
of argued that the United States kind of
won the war right uh you know 50 years
later what do you mean by that the
United States you know didn't it didn't
win the war in 1973 obviously but if you
look at Vietnam today you know how why
would you say that the United States
kind of achieved many of its objectives
there well I've been
kind of a Maverick on this has done a
lot of other things I thought the U.S
had won the war by 1970s
now if you look back at the early
documents when the war was being planned
early 50s
The Truman Administration we have the
documentary record and they're pretty
clear about it
they say it's a
matches and put it
if you have one rotten apple that can
spoil the barrel
you know if Vietnam becomes independent
and successful it'll affect Thailand's
idolific Burma might even affect
Indonesia which has Rich resources they
were concerned it might go all the way
to Japan
with the historian John dauer Asia
historian called the super Domino
Japan might agree to as they put it to
accommodate with an independent Asia
becoming its technological
industrial center and having a resource
area in Southeast Asia
what's that
that's Japan's New Order that's what the
fascist regime has been was trying to
construct
in the early 1950s the United States was
not ready to lose the Pacific War
which is what it came down to so you
have to stop it
at its core
uh the way Kissinger put it later you
have to
prevent the stop the virus that's
spreading infection well the virus at
that point was Vietnam
we stopped it Vietnam's not going to be
a model for anybody
meanwhile in the surrounding areas
starting in the early 50s the United
States
imposed brutal dictatorships in state
after state
didn't make it to Indonesia until 1965.
but the whole region
also that's true of the background of
the military regime in Burma you know
when George Cain wrote about this uh the
uh great scholarship you want to stop a
virus from spreading contagion you kill
the virus and you inoculate the
potential victims with military
dictatorships
it was done
by 1970s that was all in place
so the initial objectives of the United
States had been achieved
they didn't achieve the maximal
objective of turning Vietnam into uh
pinochet's Chile but uh
got the basic
um the basic goals were were achieved I
must say it was never able to convince
even
friends like Marilyn young greatest
Vietnam historian couldn't believe any
of this but I think it's if you look at
the actual documentary record I think
that's pretty much what happened
no I I wrote a piece along those lines a
few years ago and kind of caught hell
for it so that's your fault yeah
it's uh so we're we're you know kind of
coming up on the 50th anniversary and
I'm already starting to see some media
uh which is kind of you know saying you
know kind of yeah the truthful story it
was it was a noble cause
you know Nixon bombed them into the
peace table and blah blah blah when when
you think of you know when people ask
about the 50th Anniversary what do you
think we should think about what should
we remember
you know uh 50 years later about this
this long and bloody uh U.S
um invasion of of a small country uh
having a National Liberation movement
I think we should
think about the reasons
the reasons are what I described
you can't allow a virus to accept
to spread infection
it's ridiculed there's a domino theory
but it's a perfectly sensible Theory
it's the theory that was held by
imperialist States forever you know in
fact the American Revolution in the 18th
century was regarded that way by
European Statesmen a modern age and the
rest said this is dangerous the danger
of republicanism could spread around the
world and undermine our controls that's
perfectly rational so the U.S was simply
taking it over and pursued it with
extreme savagery
expanding radically under Kennedy
reshaping the
a narrative as if it was a war to defend
South Vietnam from the north whereas in
fact it was a war against the South all
the way through and against Lois and
Cambodia uh which were smashed and the
U.S basically did destroy the
nationalist movements left
under conditions like that only the
harshest people survive
well they survived now we can say look
we were right because look how harsh
they are and yeah those are the ones who
survive attack brutal attacks well I
think we should rethink all of this
what I expect to see is
something like the force we just saw at
Harvard
on Iraq they ran a debate a serious
debate as to whether the Iraq invasion
qualifies as humanitarian intervention
I mean suppose we saw a debate in Moscow
as to whether Russia's invasion of
Ukraine
qualifies as humanitarian intervention
I mean we collapse in ridicule
when we see it at Harvard we say a flaw
how thoughtful
um Samantha power moderated it
wonderful I suspect we'll see something
like that well Harvard also just
rejected uh somebody for a Deeds
position because he uh spoke about
Palestinian human rights so well that's
interestingly oh it came out
uh Ken Roth who was
refused an appointment at Harvard was
praised for having taken the negative
position in that debate
uh he said no it didn't qualify as
humanitarian intervention
I mean I can't imagine even
participating in a discussion lately
yeah
but with that I think we're going to
hear things like that about Vietnam
probably
incidentally the 20th anniversary of the
Iraq invasion is also coming up so we'll
probably get
a one-two punch on this yeah be
interesting to look at
for those interested in
how depraved ideological fanaticism can
become
when I started studying Vietnam a while
ago you know I think there was a
consensus you know a very negative
criticism of it and I you know it's
certainly kind of being rehabilitated
significantly since then so I appreciate
that you've among others but you know uh
continue to to talk you know speak about
it in these in the you know realistic
ways based on evidence based on the
record but uh yeah as a historical
episode I I find it quite distressing
it is but
there have been good signs the American
population is much more opposed to
aggression than it was oh yes years ago
I mean we saw that in the invasion of
Iraq there were huge protests
unprecedented even before the invasion
was launched
a big difference from Vietnam whereas I
said before you couldn't even have a
public demonstration about it for years
in Liberal cities like Boston
that's that's a change
as always you know I could talk you
forever um I appreciate this so much I
wanted to you know talk a little bit
about this because I know there's going
to be a lot of media attention and I
wanted to kind of present a different
point of view about it and I know Scott
and I are also going to do another show
on this uh to talk about it you know to
try to come you know through our
happiness struggle yeah but you're used
to that it's no fun to be in the I've
never been in the majority so I would
know but I don't think I think it's more
fun to to kind of be you know uh but I
really appreciate it uh you know this
has been fantastic and and I'm sure you
know there'll be a lot to talk about in
the next coming week so I really wanted
to to make this contribution to it on
the green and red podcast so I really
appreciate it and and thank you so much
