[Music]
so hello everybody and welcome to the
project thank you so much for spreading
the word please keep doing it that's why
the project continues to grow
subscribe it's free
get that free agent merch why
once we get a nice chunk of money right
and what do i mean by nice chunk well
we'll see i got to see how much it grows
then we're going to crowdsource who gets
it in different ways different charities
kind of show that together we can make
something happen so the question of the
day
feels like we keep repeating mistakes
doesn't it
the answer
that's because we do why
that's because nothing changes if
nothing changes
we are all collectively stuck in this
toxic twosome of parties
they win by opposing the other side now
be very clear i don't see the two
parties as equal offenders okay but it
doesn't matter
because they are both contributing to a
dynamic that we are deadlocked within
nonetheless it doesn't matter that one
is better than the other or one is worse
than the other
more and more of you don't want to be
part of either that's the problem the
solution is that you own yourself as a
free agent
that you have more options that you have
more choices and you make decisions that
benefit you and the people that you take
care of
now we have seen
this problem go beyond politics which is
the real problem right it'd be one thing
if it just stayed in washington it's not
how it is
we've seen it it's spread to our social
struggles and how we see them to our
culture even to covet it all became
about politics
look at the news
how can helping veterans deal with burn
pit illnesses which by the way we
ignored for way too long for decades
this has been a problem
how can that be hard to pass
don't we all support the troops
the answer to that is no why we fail
them way too often we fail to keep
promises to support them despite the
fact we all celebrate how they support
us they're all heroes right until it
gets to budgeting and then there's zeros
nobody wants to spend money
senator cruz
and some of the cronies there on the
extreme right they made up this notion
of budget gimmicks all of a sudden
budget gimmicks and these democrats with
their budget gimmicks 400
supposed to be discretionary now it's
mandatory mandatory now it's
discretionary
why
he'd still be playing at that game if
jon stewart had come out and whooped his
ass
if there wasn't somebody who could get
the publicity that jon stewart did the
respect from the media
to push back on that narrative
it may still be going on
and all stewart did was state the
obvious and something the media should
have been doing in his place before he
ever piped up about it
the bill never changed
what changed was the optics
the optics became not just about the
veterans but about the democrats about
biden getting a win that's unacceptable
to cruz why he is an expert player of
this toxic game
he only wins
if it is zero sum the win for him must
be a loss for the democrats cruz isn't
alone he's just one of the most clever
and high profile that's why he gets the
attention
but for veterans to suffer because of
that game
it is a shame
and until more of you start saying it's
a shame that you won't tolerate the game
it will continue to be played
taiwan
now i personally think that ukraine
should be more front and center in our
politics i certainly think it's a more
urgent cause right now in terms of being
connected to american interests and
ideals not to mention that there's
active shelling now around nuclear
facilities in ukraine
but
with both ukraine and taiwan we are
cheapening them into partisan positions
taiwan for the right is more about
pelosi
than it is for china i mean just listen
to him
military moves by china just four miles
away from the taiwanese coast
pelosi
taking that trip
she's the bad guy why
isn't it because she stokes the anger
of their base more than china does
and is that all that's necessary to form
a position about something as important
as existential
as china's moves
all these blue and yellow armbands that
we've been seeing you don't seem as much
now
ukraine support right i stand with
ukraine
but now all of a sudden ukraine is about
money well we spent enough i mean we
gave him billions of billions what else
we supposed to do do you know how many
countries around this world we give
billions and billions of dollars to
google it
you know it only becomes about money
when somebody doesn't want to do
something in government and for a party
it only becomes about spending when the
other party is proposing it republicans
don't complain about spending when it's
the trump tax cuts then it's not about
spending right but when the democrats
spend then you have to hear about it
even if it means messing with a veterans
bill
that is the petty politics of division
that is what this project has been set
up to defeat
to expose and hopefully in some way with
your help and people like you to remedy
so today
on the project we're going to show how
this
kind of recidivism of reductionist
tendencies
is happening again and it could result
in a lot of people being sick
let me give you some cultural context to
why i believe that this is something
that we can do better on
krs
one okay uh it stands for knowledge
ah you know what look it up yourself
he's one of my favorite rappers okay
krs1 his real name is chris and he
rapped
about how you must learn from history uh
the who sang a song about not getting
fooled again both were these anthems uh
as a caution
that you have to learn from the past
you have to learn to do better or simply
just not to do worse
insiders really can't make this change
that i'm asking to be made the game
won't allow it
only you can change the game free agents
open-minded regular people who seek
solutions to problems not merely
advantage out of them
hard times can make you strong just
because you have a problem just because
we're dealing with challenges and
difficulties doesn't mean we have to
succumb to them you know if you read
about the stoics okay there's an author
ryan holliday who's writing about them
very well very effectively you can look
him up
they believed very centrally that an
obstacle in life
must be the way of your life now what
does that mean
it means that
adversity can lead to a better place
well how it's a problem it's bad right
but often in life it's about what you
make of a situation
all right certain things are objective
okay this shirt is blue as long as you
can see color it's always going to be
blue
how i feel about wearing a blue shirt
that's not objective that's subjective
and as long as i like it
and that's what matters to me that's all
that matters now some people could call
that delusion
i don't i call it perspective
and if you have a perspective that no
matter what happens to you in your life
or is being done to you or around you
you can make a difference that turns it
into something positive useful
then it will be and you see that in the
stoics that adversity can lead to a
better place if you want to make it so
meaning if you endeavor to make
something good out of something bad
you'll get somewhere better
all of this is the positioning of this
episode because we're about to go into
an ugly repeat mode i fear
there is a lie spreading
and it is proof of something that has
been killing us for decades
monkey pox
no not that stupid
sounding virus terrible name monkey pox
if you want anybody to take it seriously
they should have changed the name okay
i'm not sounding the alarm about monkey
pox either all right i'm not saying
we're all doomed we're all going to get
it or anything like that
it is what this virus represents
not the reality of at this point that is
a real threat
yes
just to be accurate it is now a national
emergency according to the us government
but be very clear that designation is
more about funding than it is about
legitimate fear of the spread or how
pernicious it is or how dangerous it is
it's about funding and that's fine it's
an important step and it shows there's
an urgency here however
we don't have enough vaccine again why
not why don't we learn the lesson that
is a legitimate question and i think i'm
going to be asking a lot more in the
future but
it's not ripe for us today here's what
is
and it really sickens me more than any
virus could
this virus
is being mistreated in a way that i
lived through once before
nope
not kovit
kovid was and is real by the way as all
of us know i know you're hearing about
cases right now around you and it's
going to come up again
in school time and we'll have to deal
with it
however
if you want to talk over for a second if
you want to be in the blame game about
covet and you're on the right you better
start pointing your fingers at former
president trump and then another one at
yourself
okay because that's how our troubles
started with covet trump played politics
with it and that made everything worse
and that's just the truth
too many of you went along with what he
was saying and it led to a denialism
that was literally deadly
yes there were plenty of mistakes made
by democrats and clinicians at the
federal and the state level of course
but it all followed that and that first
step in the wrong direction was a big
one so if you want to play blame game
there fine just start with yourselves
okay things should have been so much
better but i'm talking about something
else
and again this isn't an opinion go look
at the other countries look at their
case rates what they were when they
started to come down the timing how
their societies came together and then
comparing what happened here in america
the richest and supposedly a place
that's all about this interconnectedness
all right now
putting poison politics to the side
we have another problem that we got to
address okay and it's absolutely about
monkey pox's as a as a symbol of this
okay
when i was a kid
the scariest thing that i had ever heard
of was initially called something
named grid
do you remember grid are you old enough
i hope not
if not google it
google grid and aids and you will see
it was the original
name for it
gay related immune deficiency
that's what hiv was dismissed as early
on the gay plague
people would call it
and in less polite company
what was the suggestion
as obvious as it was ugly
this is what they get
this is the price
for their sinful lifestyle unclean
unnatural
now they're going to get this for it
my neighborhood had those echoes
i saw a gay man who lived down the
street getting taunted as this is what
you guys deserve
that was us at our worst
now we know what
hiv wasn't about being gay
imagine if back then we had seen it for
what it was how much faster there would
be the cures now that change people's
lives that save people's lives
imagine
so that was the past right we're so much
more woke now we're so much more
tolerant right
nope we are here once again woke is
everywhere right
sure
but why are gays being blamed for monkey
pox
well most of the cases here involve men
who have sex with men right that's what
we call them now men who have sex with
men
that used to be just gay
okay
here's my problem with that is there
more expansive
identity and a realization of it maybe
but i think in this political
correctness we are losing substantive
correctness okay because i don't care
what you call people in this community
in that category but you're not treating
them the right way because you're making
it seem as though
how they act is why they're getting sick
and we don't know that
we don't know that
i don't care what you want to call the
group i want you to treat them with
respect
and have clear eyes
about what happens to them and whether
or not it can happen to anybody okay
gays were blamed for hiv the same way
the talk started the same way this
monkey pox stuff is this time i actually
believe it's more egregious
here's why one we've been through it
before and we should have learned but we
didn't and two scientifically monkey pox
has nothing to do with sexual
transmission we don't know that
it's not designated as an std
comes from close contact yeah
but not necessarily sexual contact look
it up
so
we didn't learn and we're doing it again
because of this temptation to otherize
do we know why gay men are getting it
more than others or men who have sex
with other men
is it because of the sex do we know that
well we do know that the cases are
mostly in that community fair point
but why is that why do we just jump to
the conclusion it's because of how they
behave
maybe it's that they're more health
conscious maybe it's because those
communities are getting tested more
frequently so we're evidencing the cases
remember that with covid you remember
president trump
well you only have more cases because
you're testing more test less less cases
bingo
didn't sound any better than than it
does now
so today we have a doctor who knows
about this virus and lived
what i lived with grid except he made a
decision with his life to help those
people in a profound way and he fought
aids and helped develop the cases and
the treatments
and he's been doing it for years he
lived it and he helped deal with it dr
jorge rodriguez he's an expert on the
science with monkey pox he's going to
talk to us about what the probabilities
are and what he's worried about and what
he thinks can happen next
but just as much he has insight into a
stigma which cannot happen again
[Music]
dr jorge thank you very much uh my
pleasure chris
boy it sure does smack familiar to me in
the worst way
monkey pox well it's mostly the gays or
now we say more politely
men who have sex with men change the
language didn't change the stigma
am i exaggerating this am i
oversensitive or does this smack of the
early
grid
days to you and that that's what they
get mentality that you and i lived
through yeah i think you're absolutely
right um and then it's a double-edged
sword right because you need to know
where an infectious disease is located
in order to control it but you also send
the mixed message that those are the
only type of people
you know that get it when in the early
90s and late 80s uh chris my practice
was primarily
gay men with hiv i myself
am a gay man so this hits very close to
home and i read an interesting article i
think in the post this african-american
woman that said wow the fact that it was
not told us that anybody could get it
was probably the reason that i got it
because i was not careful
so yeah it smacks exactly of grid
now
unlike hiv right hiv had semen to blood
blood to blood there were different ways
to get it that certainly lended somebody
uh the the option of
a
sexually transmitted uh disease you
could get it that way monkey pox we
don't know at all that the science
supports that that's how you're getting
it is through sex do we no we don't as a
matter of fact we think that
that is probably one of the minor ways
that you get it however you know usually
in the sex act right if you do it right
it's like a lot of body contact you know
and and we'll save those instructions
for a different segment we'll just deal
with the monkey pox one first but
absolutely there is obviously an
intimacy of contact uh within the
intimacy of uh sex as well so you can
get it that way but it shouldn't be
confused with hiv in terms of that being
its primary kind of transmission of
semen of semen or blood to blood that's
correct it should not be confused that
way you know but the truth is like you
said they really don't know so they're
actually now
looking at that to see if there is maybe
an increased amount of virus in body
fluids we we do know that obviously
exposing yourself to the pox itself you
know transmits it but also let's say
that somebody has a sore throat and it's
due to a pox that they can't see deep
down in their throat well kissing that
person you know can also spread it so
right now it looks like person to person
skin contact or membrane to membrane
contact and doc one of the reasons i'm
happy to have uh dr jorge on is he's a
straight shooter on this you know he's a
clinician first and that's important
when you don't talk about scientific
things this suggestion you tell me if
i'm just off base but is it a real
question that
well maybe gay men
are showing more cases in that community
because they're more health conscious
and they're getting tested more so those
cases are being identified first just
like we saw with kovit as as former
president trump clumsily said well
you're only having more cases because
you're testing more if you test less
you'll have less cases you know that was
obviously absurd on its face but it may
ring true that yeah you're testing that
community more that's why they're having
more cases than others could there be
something to that yeah i think there
could be something to that because
obviously you know the gay community the
men of sex with men communities hyper
aware of this and from the moment it
started to escalate i mean we were
inundated with calls we were inundated
with people knowing where to get tested
whether we would test them so
i think yes that that's a possibility
that it's maybe being over reported
because one community is being you know
checked but i think that regardless of
that just the exponential growth even
within the community of men have sex
with men tells you that this is
something that can be very scary and is
probably going up eventually if not
already in all communities well they
the government declared it a national
emergency that's primarily about funding
on the other side of the scale uh the
severity scale convince me that i need
to be more worried about this i mean the
symptoms being largely like smallpox you
know you have those vaccines that
aren't being used as much but they
should be able to be ramped up i would
argue they should have had more of them
already but that's
a more discreet conversation you're not
going to die from this we're not going
to see it spread uh in all likelihood
like kovid and we don't believe that
it's as dangerous as kovit at this point
i think the caveat that should get you
to be concerned is the fact that you
said at this point
so so let's take this for what it is
usually in the world before this
ramp up of of monkey pox there were
maybe 400 cases a year that were
isolated to parts of africa now we have
28 30 000 cases that we know of
in in a couple of months
the lesson or one of the lessons that we
learned from covet is the fact that the
more infection there is the more
mutations that can occur and that's one
of the big scary issues that nobody's
talking about the more people get
infected who says that this virus is not
going to try to be smarter than it is
and and that's sort of like a
teleological thing where the virus
doesn't really think but when it mutates
let's say it mutates to a type or a
variant that is much more contagious
that can be spread aerosolized so
that should scare or should be of
concern to anybody whether they're gay
men who have sex with men that it is now
the time if possible to get vaccinated
and to be preventative before this thing
really explodes into what could be a
kova type of a pandemic criticism dr
jorge is engaging in that big brother
scare you scare you without scientific
basis it could be this it could be that
and this is what you guys do in the
clinical community you make something
out of nothing just because it's
possible but not probable fair or no not
fair and and i'll tell you why well you
know what
sometimes you never can win right and
the retrospectoscope is always 20 20.
the counter criticism
to that would be four months from now
you guys knew about this and you didn't
tell us anything which people already
saying about about monkey pox how come
you didn't start earlier right now i am
telling people that this is escalating
at a rate that should be of concern
might it die out tomorrow i hope so so
it is better
i think to be preemptive and to be
cautious at this point than to be
nonchalant and laser fair and not worry
about it so say what you want i would
rather er on the side of caution than
just say don't worry about it man you're
going to be fine but it doesn't worry
you the way kova did at this point it
does not worry me the way kobe did at
all there's it's apples and oranges in
the fact that covet is airborne and i
don't really know what the what's called
the are not factor of this is and are
not is how many
people one person can infect
covet had a very huge r knot from the
beginning and the variants are even
higher we also had no vaccine we also
had no vaccine right so now we have
something that we can get ready that
works with smallpox which this virus is
being likened to
what do you make of my disposition at
this point being more concerned about
the stigma
in the gay community and not because you
know i'm some lefty or something i just
living through
grid
you know nobody knows that we're like
totally old it's a totally old test you
know gay related
i remember that i remember how people
were looking at gays and saying this is
what you get
and it was otherwising and scary and
stupid
but i'm worried about that because as
woke as everybody wants to say that we
are and cancel this cancel that here we
are with monkey pox and we're right back
where we were in the early 80s i can't
tell you how many sophisticated educated
sensitive people in my life are saying
i'm not worried about this i'm not gay
yeah you're right and and let me let me
just um bring forth something and i
think you're right
classifying something serves a purpose
so for example classifying it right now
is an infection where it is mostly men
who have sex with men transmitting it
lets you focus on trying to stop it
spreading from that community and like i
said before it's a double-edged sword
where other people think hey it doesn't
affect me let me bring some things to
light i think yesterday there was a
worker right at a daycare day care
center with children who had monkey pox
school is starting
college is starting you know that
college kids have sex right so
there are now starting in the fall areas
where there are going to be potentially
huge
sections that may
have social habits that worsen this you
know and make it go even even more sky
high so to think that it's just gays
right now is a very very dangerous thing
now looking at the numbers from uh the
world health organization uh you're
absolutely right that they are seeing
what would
what would mathematically be considered
a spike right now over the last month
it's up uh almost 20 percent certainly
north of 15
so in terms of scenarios and what you're
hearing about trajectory where is the
kind of defcon scary factor about this
right now heading into
school season i think the the scary
deathcom
number is not going to be necessarily
the total number but if we start seeing
an increase in sub groups that we don't
expect to see it in that's the number i
mean right now it isn't so much the
number but when you map this out it is
the slope of the line going up it isn't
tapering off it is just going
exponentially straight up so until you
see
a taper and i hate the flattening of the
curve thing we talked about that ad
nauseam with covet you know and you
don't want to flatten the curve when
it's really high so what would me
be scary a if this keeps growing weak
to week to week at the same trajectory
or
we start seeing the slope even greater
and that includes coming from other
sub culture subgroups of our
of our population you know with covid
it was politicized
with monkey pox
it's actually a deeper more pernicious
um obstacle to entry no pun intended
which is going to be well i'm not gay
i'm not getting that vaccine that means
i'm gay you know and as much as people
want to say yeah i don't have to tell
you this you live it but you know when
you're a member of a community you know
as a gay male you know who says the
right thing versus who actually feels
the right thing about you as a human
being
and that's my concern here is that's the
last thing we need is a stigma on top of
a political bias yeah and then nobody's
going to want to act no for for sure
listen um when you were on the bill
maher show recently uh and and i love
bill you know and he irritates me but
sometimes he has such insight he said
one thing though that showed me that
even the most aware people don't get it
and he made a joke about the fact that
now it's like it's called men who have
sex with men as opposed to the gay
community there are a lot of men who
have sex with other men whether they're
married or on the down low or in the
closet that don't identify as gay so
therefore it's been found that if you
say it as men who have sex with men
all right that more people will actually
go to get treatment so that's something
that's very subtle right and it was like
oh we know what that community is not
really that community is very broad
my feeling is i don't care what you call
it
i want those people treated with respect
and my concern and this is what really
has me talking about monkey pox i'll be
honest um i love having you on the show
i hope i get to talk to you often here
on the project um but i'd rather be
about something else or until this gets
to be more critical because
for me what bothers me is this stigma
you know and everybody all the reporting
is men who have sex with men yeah but
they're all still reporting that that
community has monkey pox like it's
supposed to
and i just don't buy it and it's not
because i'm some snowflake i don't buy
it because i lived it and i remember my
father and tony fauci you know who made
his name fighting aids early on saying
it's not just gay men yeah it's the same
as it was then so how much better are we
today i think we're a little bit better
uh but at the end of the day when
there's a problem you always tend to
point those fingers you know at the
boogie man let me just tell you another
another statistic i think two or three
weeks ago for the first time since the
beginning of hiv
the largest number of new hiv cases was
in heterosexuals as opposed to
gay men the virus does does not
discriminate that that's all we can say
so when i talk to you again
when we are now somewhere between back
to school college
and
halloween what do you think the range of
probabilities is i think we'll be
talking more about this i think that
will be spread
in primarily kids who bring it to their
parents and college kids
the only reason we wouldn't be talking
about that is because
the man who have sex with ben community
has been so vaccinated that it really
hasn't spread anywhere else but i think
we're what at 30 000 now probably in a
couple of months it'll be way above 100
000 cases throughout the world because
not everybody's vaccinating like we are
uh spain the uk
they they're exploding with this also so
i think we'll still be talking about
this and i think hopefully we'll be
talking about
the new covid
bivalent vaccine that'll you know really
cut things down quite a bit if you take
it yeah if you take it listen medicine
doesn't work unless you take it you know
that's the old rule you know i can write
the prescription brother but if you
don't take it it does not work that's
deep dr jorge is that that is that's
some deep stuff is that what magna
laude gets you medicine doesn't work
unless you take it unless you take it
right you would think that anybody would
guess that
unfortunately one of the upsides of
illness
is that when
you know when people are sick it's
something we can relate to and hopefully
we see more of that with this virus
and what happens with covet and all the
illnesses yet to come and dr jorge i
look forward to welcoming you here i'd
love to have you as part of the family
count on it thank you so much chris it's
it's a pleasure and you really i hope
are opening a lot of eyes thank you
a little bit of this is we'll wait and
see right
and we'll have dr jorge back we'll see
what happens when we're back to school
we're going to have plenty of health
issues there always are but we have
active viruses that are difficult to
treat and that spread very quickly where
will monkey pox be and who will be among
what we can deal with right now
is to not judge a group of people and
otherize them
especially when it's about health
if that doesn't trigger our instinct to
care about one another we got way bigger
illnesses to deal with than any virus
now
another question in understanding why we
struggle
takes you to fundamental and deep
questions suggestions criticisms about
how our system came to be this way
binary
power versus powerless does it have to
be this way has it always been this way
you're about
to be engaged with one of the best
thinkers in our society noam chomsky
he's got a million titles he is a
thinker he is a philosopher he's a
political scientist he is a professor he
is a linguist but more importantly he is
an observer
with an intelligent eye and mind of what
has happened
over the decades over the generations
now at this point to get us to where we
are if you really want to take on the
questions
of how we get to a better place where we
are right now you must understand how we
got here and nobody has watched it with
a more discerning eye than noam chomsky
[Music]
let me begin by saying it is a true
privilege uh to have this time to talk
with you noam chomsky
thank you very much
let's start with where we are as a
society in america how would you
describe
the current dynamic in our society well
the
major
and crucially important fact is that the
social order is
close to collapse there's a breakdown in
the
political system
which seems
almost irresoluble
the judiciary is
acting in ways which are
undermining the
possibilities for
decent survival
there's a large element in the society
that really doesn't think that
we can even continue on the
current lines is thinking of
violent civil war
it's a very dangerous moment
and the political system is
simply
frozen can't respond why do you think
that is why is the system frozen
the underlying issue i think
is that for
40 years the population of the united
states
has been subjected to a
major assault
you can see it's simply in numbers
so for example the uh
rand corporation very
respectable
the reliable quasi government
corporation recently did a
study
of the
transfer of wealth
from
the general population
working class middle class
over 90 percent of the population
transfer of wealth from them
to the top one percent
in the past since reagan past 40 years
uh roughly 50 trillion dollars
that's
not small change
and it's had an effect on all aspects of
the society
there's extraordinary wealth accumulated
most people are
just about surviving
majority in fact say they get from
paycheck to paycheck
very little in reserve
uh the uh
there are jobs but uh little security
a lot of it's
precarious there's no sense that things
are
getting better in fact getting worse
but real well made male wages
part about what they were in 1979
well
at the same time
private wealth in very few hands has
simply exploded
the ratio of wealth between a
ceo and a worker has
changed what do you make of the
uh primary pushback
to that argument which is basically
two-pronged one is
capitalism is about uh creating success
through
opportunity and effort and people making
money isn't a bad thing unless you're a
socialist
and
the reason that
more workers aren't doing well is
because of too big of a government with
too many regulations
on business that make it too hard to run
a business in a way that you can pay
people more what do you make of those
arguments
well it's very easily refuted
we've been through
two phases
of
state capitalism
since the second world war
the first one was
what's sometimes called regimented
capitalism
high taxes on the rich
a lot of regulation
no financial crises
financial systems were regulated
the fastest growth period in american
history
now we've been through a second period
the neoliberal period
incline in regulations move towards
monopolization
lower growth lower productivity
uh people who are wealthy in the first
phase they're super wealthy and the
second
has almost nothing to do with effort has
to do with government policies
which have changed in such a way
as to punish the general population
and to reward the super-rich
and the corporate structure and we see
the results
uh instead of
a period of fast
relatively egalitarian growth we've seen
lower growth
radically inequalitarian
it's not because of more regulation
because of less regulation
which in fact
increased the move towards
monopolization
high profits less creativity enrichment
of the super rich you have been
experiencing our society since the
depression you grew up in the depression
you understood the need and the
desperation of your own family you watch
society climb out of it all the way up
until today
when were things better
in america than they are today
lots of things are better
so go
back 50 years and see
at that time
the united states had
lost
boring
miscegenation
that were so extreme that the nazis
wouldn't accept them
the there was
federally supported housing
but it was segregated by law
which blocked
afro-americans from the
growth period of the 1950s which was
largely poverty based
women did not have the rights of persons
wasn't granted by the supreme court
until
1975.
there's been enormous changes which have
civilized the society
things that were
considered normal in the 1960s
would be unspeakable today
that's all progress
but not on the economic front
that changed
there was a change
through the 1970s took off with reagan
thatcher in england
which instituted
a new array of state policies
which have had
deleterious harmful effects
on the vast majority of the population
and enriched a tiny few
and it has not led to economic growth in
fact it's loaded
this is it started with reagan but it
was picked up by the his successors
so during the clinton years
the specific form of
neoliberal globalization was instituted
which is called free market but that's a
joke by the protectionist
a core part of the
world trade organization rules
is exorbitant patent rights
intellectual property rights they're
called
which are designed to maximize
basically monopoly pricing rights
one of the reasons why drugs are out of
sight
all of this followed the
reaganite policies amplified by clinton
continuing up to the prison
do you think that socially we are at a
pivot point uh where this society is
going to decide to continue moving
forward or maybe
to have
uh a renewed conservativism which will
be seen as moving back to many
well we have to be careful about the
word conservatism
in my view the
last
significant conservative in the united
states was
dwight eisenhower
he
argued that anyone who questions
new deal reforms
doesn't belong in our political system
anyone who questions the rights of
working people to organize
we don't want them in our society
he sounds
to the left of bernie sanders
that was conservatism in the 1950s
what's called conservatism has moved to
radical
reactionary statism doesn't reduce the
state effect increases it
but it's a big change so if there's a
move to conservatism
well i think bernie sanders could be in
the lead how would you describe
this current move that we've seen in the
supreme court
rolling back roe v wade maybe taking on
other social policy jurisprudence
the cultural discussion we're having
about the understanding of diversity
uh the
racial
inflammation that has
come up in these inflammatory segments
that surround policing and other uh
shootings in our society how do you
understand where we are
i mentioned many of the
civilizing effects of the
1960s activism and their aftermath
supreme court is trying to roll those
back
and in fact it's
even more dangerous
so one of the more
most dangerous decisions of the court
was the west virginia
uh the epa decision
the
was an interesting case because there
was no reason for the court even to pick
it up
it was about a statute that has never
been implemented and is inoperative
no reason to take it up at all
but they took it up because they're
trying to make a point
we have to move to undermine
what is called the
administrative state
the state
that
undertakes
measures
to deal with current critical problems
and does
institute constraints
on the
industries that want to increase their
exorbitant profit-making
look at their reasoning their reasoning
is that the
epa efforts to reduce
emissions
or what they call a
major
decision
problem changes the
course of the way the economy functions
yes that's what regulations are supposed
to do
the economy is functioning now
in such a way
that will race us
to a precipice that which will be
destroyed and will bring the world down
with it
global warming can't be talked away
it's uh it's right in front of our eyes
it's getting worse
we'll pass irreversible tipping points
unless
we do something
pretty significant move
along the lines that the
international scientific commission the
ipcc has recommended as a systematic
reduction in fossil fuels
every year
until we basically eliminate them within
a couple of decades otherwise we're lost
now how does congress deal with this
well congress made general regulations
the one in question was never even
implemented because of congressional
blogging
but congress makes general regulations
assigns to
regulatory agencies the task of
investigating them
bringing in
scientific analysis economic analysis
doing careful studies trying to decide
what the best way would be
congress can't possibly do that
it's not the task of congress to carry
out such studies so they delegated
that's the administrative state
supreme court is putting that as its
target to the lemonade
which will destroy the society and in
fact bring the world down with it what
does it mean gnome that
there's so many people in our society
who believe
that
global warming is grossly exaggerated
that the move towards uh renewable fuels
is
um
being rushed
and that people are having electric
vehicles forced on them
when we still have plenty of fossil
fuels that we can use
and this is about a crazy lefty push
towards a green economy the crazy lefty
bush
is
virtually a hundred percent
of the scientific community they're not
lefties
this is scientists who are studying the
climate
they have strong evidence there's
overwhelming consensus
that we're moving towards destruction of
the conditions for organized life on
worth
you can read the wall street journal
editorial today for example
saying exactly what you said
we're rushing it
we want to make sure that we maximize
the use of fossil fuels we'll we'll have
more tomorrow
and our grandchildren will have nothing
okay
those are the choices there's no lefties
it's virtually all scientists of any
competence
now you're right about public opinion
so there was
a major study that came out a couple
days ago
yale university does regular studies on
public opinion on climate warming they
came out with their latest one a couple
days ago it's worth looking at
they divided it into
republicans and democrats
the study that they carried out was to
give people
29
issues
and ask them
how do you rate these in importance in
your voting for the next election
november
election well
among republicans
what they called moderate republicans
ranked global warming 28th
among the rest of the republicans 29th
out of 29. it's only the most important
issue that's ever risen in human history
unless we deal with it we're finished
yes we can have
more suvs tomorrow
and our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren
will be facing total catastrophe that's
the first estimate
what issue
that is
future oriented
has ever
received consensus in the present it's a
new deal in the 1930s
new deal policies were aimed for the
future
took a long time
actually they were on hold during the
second world war
pretty much implemented after the war
but weren't they meant to address the
crisis of the great depression and
create shovel-ready jobs as fdr called
them and prop up the society in that
moment the roosevelt policies
did smooth some of the rough edges
but didn't end the depression
you look at the figures it
wasn't very different in numbers in
1939 and 1932
was the war that ended the depression
what the war did
was create
a government a large government that
massively intervened in the economy
controlled wages and prices
and led to enormous creativity
industrial production virtually
quadrupled many new inventions in fact
the basis for the high-tech economy of
the future was largely
laid then
and
people were poor
like
you couldn't drive
if you could even get a car
if you wanted to drive you had to go
less than
35 miles an hour and try to save gas it
was ratcheting
so it wasn't that it was easy but people
were working together
for the common good
and to create a better future
well that better future came in the
post-war world
but it's not the same as today
today we are faced with a question
of whether we care enough about our
grandchildren
great-grandchildren
to ensure that they have a world not
only in which they can survive but a
better world
world based on renewable energy will be
a much better world than this one
but can they get a world at all or are
we going to insist that we want to sit
with our suv in a traffic jam how
important is it to change the two-party
system to get something done
in this country meaning
do you think it's time for more parties
you're not going to get rid of parties
altogether um but do you think that the
two-party system is exacerbating the
tensions and that we need more parties
we need
functioning political parties
right now it's more like a no party
system the republican party
pretty much stopped being a political
and ordinary political party many years
ago two
analysts for the american enterprise
institute not lefties ten years ago
described the republican party as a
radical insurgency
that has abandoned parliamentary
politics
we can see it in congress right now
the biden programs you
can debate them i think many of them
were pretty constructive
100
republican opposition to anything
anything that could
benefit the country
stop it
100 percent that's the mcconnell
republican party
in fact he says so he said it during the
obama years he said our
task is to make sure that nothing is
implemented same thing in the blind
years make sure that nothing is done
reason
country will be harmed
people blame the democrats we can come
back to power
that's not that's not a political party
that's something else but it's also the
nature of the game now isn't it gnome i
mean
you know
you know the expression
don't hate the player hate the game
um when you have two parties the easiest
way
for me to win against you in an election
is
chomsky's a bum
that's new
that's not the way it was
go back
pre-neo-liberal 50 years there was
virtually no difference between moderate
republicans and
liberal democrats i mean i voted for
republicans the parties cooperated
take a look say at the nixon terrors
parties cooperated on that
republicans didn't try to claim that
nixon didn't do anything
it was not like today
what changed
neo-liberalism they started in the late
quarter years
went on took off under reagan
the enormous
the policies designed to enrich
enormously the super-rich and the
corporate sector
spilled over to the political system
the more you concentrate economic power
the more you
undermine
political functioning because of the
power of concentrated capital over the
political system
so
and it kind of grows out of itself like
in clinton for example was a
kind of a centrist democrat but he
followed basically the reaganine
policies and
exacerbated the situation
pretty much the same with obama how do
people
get convinced to be in favor of policies
that work against their own personal
interests they want tax cuts for the top
when they don't even benefit from those
tax cuts and they're against tax cuts
you know tax increases for the rich when
they would benefit
how did we get to that place well first
of all it's not that people are like
them let's go back to the 1930s
the what you call
ready shovel work people didn't oppose
that
they supported it
because they were working for the common
good
you wanted
people not to sell rags at your door
it's better to have them do work that
wpa is setting up for them
you're talking about the neoliberal
period
which changed attitudes
so when reagan made his
outrageous racist speeches about welfare
queens
that hit the population yeah i don't
want some
black woman driving in her limousine to
pick up my social security check
so there's tremendous propaganda from
the increasingly racist
right
which
did have an impact
and it's very striking to see
notice what happened to the republican
party since nixon
richard nixon as you recall
introduced what was called the southern
strategy
the idea was
it was understood by the
nixon administration that they couldn't
possibly win votes on their actual
policies
any more than trump could
you can't come to the population and say
i would like to rob you blind
and
transfer your wealth to a tiny sector of
super rich vote for me
that doesn't work so what you have to do
is cover it up somehow
it was instituted by nixon with a
southern strategy
democrats were voting for civil rights
laws his strategists figured out so
immediately that they could pick up the
southern vote southern democratic vote
if they gave
racist dog whistles you didn't come out
and say i'm racist and just made it
clear that you were opposing these
measures in fact if you look at
alderman's diaries pretty explicit
uh
then goes on
to a broader cons understanding if we
can shift attention away from economic
issues to what are called cultural
issues
we have a chance
so let's pretend we're in favor of
abortion
in the mid-1970s
republican strategists paul virat
recognized
that if the republicans shift
from
their what we now call pro-choice
position
to
anti-abortion they could pick up the
evangelical vote which wasn't much
organized at the time and the northern
catholic food
so they switched
you go back to the 60s
reagan as governor of california
passed strong pro-choice
legislation late 70s passionately
anti-abortion
george h.w bush the same
guns let's talk about guns let's talk
about anything except our policies
so let's not talk about
the one legislative achievement of the
trump years
the
2017 tax bill
what
joe stiglitz called the donor relief act
of 2017.
huge tax cut for the corporate sector
and the very rich
stab everyone else in the back let's not
talk about that
let's talk about guns let's talk about
abortion anything else we'll try to
mobilize people on cultural issues
and there's an extra element here
the population
is being undermined
transferring 50 trillion dollars of
wealth
from the working class in the middle
class to the one percent
has an effect
so they're angry
resentful
dislike institutions
faith in institutions has declined very
sharply for the benefit of republicans
that's great if people are disillusioned
hopeless
disorganized
then we can
mobilize them on cultural issues and ram
through our
great radical
pro
ultra rich corporate policies if these
ultra-rich corporate policies originate
from the right
then why is it that people on the right
believe the elites
and the super rich are on the left
is that the way it works
yes they do believe that that's part of
the propaganda
so the republicans have very
effectively
presented themselves as
the ordinary guy the working man's
policy
which means
we want a christian nation
that we want to prevent the great
replacement that we want to stop these
uh
democrats who are
grooming young children to be sex slaves
50 of republicans
let's stop that
that makes us the working-class party
while at the same time
we ran through legislation
which
totally undermines them and benefits our
real constituency the super rich
and the corporate sector
it's right in front of our eyes just
take a look at the legislations take a
look at the republican party position in
congress right now
right now
they have two red lines
one of them is
can't touch trump's
tax cut
the huge
giveaway to the super rich can't touch
that
second red line is
you can't fund the internal revenue
service
what's that about
what does the irs do
catches tax thieves who are the taxis
the working man who
turns in
his is bill not him it's the super rich
who are robbing like mad
so we got to cut back the irs
so they can't catch robbers if it's all
so naked
and
the left has a registration advantage
why is there such a deadlock in terms of
political power
well first of all
i haven't said anything about the
democrats so let me say something about
them
sure in the 1970s the democrats
essentially abandoned the working class
the last move was the
humphrey hawkins full employment act
1978
carter was president
he was quite anti-labor
and he didn't veto it but he watered it
down so it had no teeth
and he began in the moves that break and
then escalated
by then the democrats were becoming a
party of
affluent professionals wall street
bankers
the guys in the clinton management
people who show up at obama's fancy
parties and so on
almost nothing for the working class in
fact you could see it
in the way the tarp legislation was
implemented the working population had
basically has no representative
well now that's changed it changed with
the bernie sanders movement
sanders did succeed in
mobilizing
huge part mostly young
but
couldn't get through he did get an
important position
the budget committee and in fact a
pretty reasonable biden proposals
were coming out of the sanders budget
committee but they were killed
by a hundred percent
republican opposition
and a couple of right-wing democrats but
isn't all of this symptomatic of a toxic
two-party system
that can only be remedied
by
uh increasing
the value of compromise right now
there's no upside to compromise
you win
by beating the other side it is
certainly zero sum
and whether it was always like that or
no and i'll accept your premise that it
wasn't
it is now
and
wouldn't more parties give you a chance
that's not what happened take a look at
the current congress
the democrats
who i don't like as you can tell
but the democrats have been
trying to compromise all the way along
republicans are 100 percent opposed to
anything that's the mcconnell principle
so it's not that the two sides can't
compromise
one side can't compromise as the others
blocked it
i don't see it as one-sided as you do
because i see the democratic party as
two parties in one
um you know joe manchin will say to you
i haven't changed the party has changed
and
there are democrats there that have
nothing in common with each other and i
know we always then use the big tent
thing uh i've never bought the big tent
thing
and
i feel like that party is two parties
and the republican party is two or three
parties and if you had three or four
parties
you would then need coalitions in order
to keep your seats first of all let's be
clear about the feds
i'm new
uh great lover of the democratic party i
think
i just described i think i have not
accused you of being as such noam
chomsky but the fact is
that the democrats have consistently
tried to compromise
take biden's legislative program
came a large part of it came out of
sanders's budget office
they proposed it republicans opposed it
they cut it back
mansion opposed it they cut it back
more and more cutbacks more and more
efforts compromise
nothing
no matter how much you compromise
the other side plus mansion are going to
block anything and finally it ended up
with nothing so they tried
in fact there's debate in the democratic
party should they have ever tried to
compromise absolutely they're having
that debate but even if it's one-sided
it still proves the weakness of the
system doesn't it
they did
try to compromise i agree
or wrongly and
you can't when you have a
radical insurgency that doesn't want to
play parliamentary politics can't
compromise unless the system
compels
coalition in order to keep your seats it
doesn't compel how does it compel it
the republicans are perfectly willing
to harm the society to destroy the
country destroy the world
just like the wall street journal
editorial said today in order to make
more profit tomorrow for the very rich
that's their commitment
now it's possible to compromise
so back in the 50s and 60s there was
plenty of compromise
this was the period of regimented
capitalism
now i don't approve of that
i think there's a deeper program when
you say there should be more parties i
think this should be a first party we
don't have political parties
what we have is
candidate producing organizations
bureaucracies that produce candidates
the population is allowed to pick among
them i mean take what we call a primary
so
there's a town in new hampshire or iowa
or somewhere
having a
political
candidate comes to talk there he says
this is me this is my policy this is
what i want to do
maybe he's lying maybe he's telling the
truth
then comes vote for me
there's an alternative
which would be called democracy
so far from our consciousness can't even
imagine it
what would happen is
somebody comes to a town in new
hampshire and
iowa
population gets together
person who comes says i'd like to hear
what you want
you make your decisions among yourselves
tell me what you've decided
i'll try to see if i can uh handle that
that would be democracy
we can't even imagine that
we're so far from democracy
we're in a situation it's been for years
where
we basically have
a one-party system the business party
has a couple of factions democrats and
republicans the population are supposed
to be spectators
yeah okay we'll pick one of you but we
don't participate
that's not functioning democracy
we have a long way to go
to get to
functioning democracy we have elements
of it we have elements of it like town
meetings and so on but only bare
elements and it doesn't affect the party
system what makes it better an actual
democratic society
in which
primaries work the way i just said
the population decides
debates discusses decides what they want
somebody comes along and says
i'd like to be your candidate the
population says here's what you have to
do
do that maybe we'll vote for you you
don't do that we don't vote for you
that's what joe manchin says his
situation is that in west virginia
they're telling him this is what matters
this is what doesn't matter don't take
away our jobs this is what matters to us
culturally and then he's going there to
try to do it to his best ability what
he's doing is destroying west virginia
is destroying
west it's very clear
to everybody with a their head screwed
on that coal mining is not going to last
in fact the united mine workers union
in west virginia
has already accepted
a transition program
in which there would be
government support
to help workers move out of the dying
coal mining industry which is going to
die and
a move to
cap the minds and carry out a transition
to renewable energy better jobs better
societies actually the wine workers
actually accepted it mansion wants to
destroy it
he wants coal miners to
continue to work under miserable
conditions until they finally the coal
mine and he makes plenty of profit he's
a cold baron himself
till finally
mining ends which it's going to do
it's economically
impossible to continue he knows that
so there are alternatives but they're
not being presented
if the democrats were
a popular party
party that was really engaged with the
public they'd be organizing in west
virginia to tell people things like this
to bring it out as an option they don't
do much of it and you think the media is
part of this mis-messaging they're just
a total part of the system what are the
media major corporations
selling
people like you and me readers
to other corporations advertisers
all deeply embedded in the system
i'm not saying it's dishonest or
anything it's just
it's the way the institutional structure
works doesn't have to but it winds up
being the same thing whether you say
whether you say it's
any way that you want to qualify the
criticism i mean
you don't believe that the american
media has been fairly robust in terms of
challenging policies and going after
corporations
at a very fringe level
so sometimes go after corruption
but they never talk about the kinds of
things we're talking about
and if you look at i mean i've written
thousands of pages of documentation
show others have as well
showing how on major issues they simply
count out to power
state and corporate power even with what
you saw in how the media responded to
donald trump and his truth abuse and
everything that followed well that was
so extreme
that even the conservatives opposed go
back to the so-called conservatives go
back to the
2016 primary the last republican primary
every
single person there
strongly opposed trump
every one
well that was the cream of the crop of
the republican leadership
they're the ones who denounced trump
then when he took over
and developed the worship of following
they all fell in line all that cream
curdled gnome i watched it in real time
and i got to tell you people
will say that they voted for trump
as a cure
i i don't believe that i i think they
voted for him as a virus to insert into
the political corpus to make it sick
because they wanted to force a fever
that would make a change
and
to this day i have people who really
believe that i was against them and
against this country because i would
chase after donald trump you know lying
about everything except how to spell his
name i agree
that's his appeal to the population but
what does that say that it mattered to
them and that they were willing to
forgive
his flaws
in favor
of
putting in a change agent that seemed to
hate everybody they hate right and he
did institute a change he made it worse
his one legislative achievement one
was the 2017 tax cut which stabbed
everyone in the back and enriched the
rich in the corporate sector the people
he works for
that's who he works for to the public he
says oh i love you
meanwhile he's stabbing in the back with
the other hand
that's an effective demagogue
but we're going back to the question of
how he was treated
the republicans
opposed him strongly
until he won power
then they're all shining his shoes it's
not because
they liked his policies it's after he
won over
the mass with effective demagoguery
while stabbing them in the back at every
chance that they all fell into line
now he owns the party
of course the
uh
his constant lies and everything else
yes the government
the press and everyone else made fun of
those but that's not the point
on major issues the media went along and
continued to
uh incidentally i'm not criticizing the
journalists journalists do a very good
job they're courageous they're honest
first thing i do in the morning is
read the new york times in washington
post
but
you have to decode it it's all within a
framework of
deep indoctrination
so simple things like
the fact that we don't even have the
beginnings of democracy
as you can see from the primary system
and everywhere else
that never gets discussed well that's
why i started this show noam chomsky
professor i'm happy to have you you are
the definition of a free agent you're
not about team or tribe
uh or you know hidden agenda or
advantage or animus you're out front
with your opinions i appreciate you for
it and you're always welcome here and i
hope we get to continue to talk great

seem to have affected both

same way

me on social media i want to read the
comments i want to see what we can glean
and i'm going to answer some of those

often benefit from hearing you get your
tone right okay 516-412-6307

things leave your email because

more information for you guys and again
the free agent merch maybe i should wear
it on the show i don't know i don't want
to get too typecast feels a little bit
like wayne's world but again it's merch

start giving money to different causes
and we'll do it together isn't that cool
