know you're headed off on a Latin
America trip right now for a month
you'll be in Brazil you'll be giving
talks in Argentina um when you go to
Brazil you're going to be meeting your
new family correct and I was wondering
if you could talk a little about
that well we've been talking about a
variety of things that range from
unpleasant to horrific but we shouldn't
Overlook the fact that the world has
some wonderful things in it too and I
got a unexpected wondrous gift from
Brazil that fell into my arms not long
ago we're now Valeria we're now about to
celebrate our first anniversary and off
to Brazil to meet Valaria
family and what is that like for you you
are um seen around the world by many as
not only as a person who shares
incredible political Insight in the
world but really is a role model and so
can you talk personally about your your
own
life U I'm a very private person I've
never talked about my own life much but
uh you know I've
I've personally I've I've been very
fortunate in my life
with uh I've there have been tragedies
there have been wonderful things and uh
Valeria's sudden appearance is one of
those wonderful
things you said after your first wife
Carol died that life without love is
empty something along those lines can
you talk about
that well I could produce some cliches
which have the Merit of being
true life without love is a pretty the
affair
it's and your own tireless schedule
keeping up your lectures writing
extensive articles uh and still
tirelessly answering the emails from
correspondence from people around the
world when I was in college I remember I
wrot you several times and got back
these long detailed answers on complex
questions and there's people across the
globe who could attest with similar
experience do you feel a certain
obligation to respond to people cuz
nobody would fault you at the age of 86
now if you took more time for
yourself um I don't know if it's an
obligation exactly uh it's a privilege
really uh these are the important people
in the
world uh remember a wonderful comment by
Howard jyn about the countless number of
unknown people who are the driving force
and history and in progress and that's
people like uh I didn't know you but
people like you writing from college
these are people who deserve respect
encouragement the hope for the future
they're uh an inspiration for me
personally you mentioned your daughter
AI um uh being an expert on Cuba among
others um you have three children that
you and Carol raised uh now broadening
your family to Valeria as well um can
you talk about uh your philosophy of
child rearing in a very politically
Active Family you have said in the past
that you thought because of your
opposition to the war in Vietnam for
example you might spend years in jail
came very close came close enough so
that
uh by
1967 68 when resistance activities were
at their heights and I was a an
unindicted co-conspirator in one trial
and the prosecutor announced I'd be the
leading person in the next trial but in
which trial pardon in which trial these
were the so-call trials of the
resistance the first was called the
Spock coffin trial although lot to say
about that the next was the next ones
were called off mainly because of the
Ted offensive in Vietnam which uh uh
convinced the American Business
community that the war is going to drag
on and they rather significant power
play they compelled Johnson to start
backing off and one of the things they
did was end the trials but it was
serious enough so that my wife Carol
went back to school after 16 years to
get a finish up with her a doctoral
degree since we had three kids to take
care of but U during those years
although I was extremely active I mean
there were times I was giving you know
seven talks a day and going to
demonstrations and so on but I always uh
managed took care to spend as much time
as I could quality time with kids when
they were growing up so what gives you
hope things like what you described also
the wonderful things in the world of the
kind that I mentioned like my
wife Professor world renown linguist
dissident author Nome chsky to hear part
one of our interview yesterday when he
talked about Israeli Prime Minister
netanyahu's speech to Congress today you
can go to our website this is just a
clip it's basically a joint effort by
Netanyahu and U uh rep mostly Republican
Hawks in the United States to undermine
any possibility of a uh negotiated
settlement with Iran neither Israel nor

region to their
violence gome Chomsky to hear both of
