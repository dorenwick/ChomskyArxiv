it's a great honor to be
awarded this
recognition and it's particularly I'm
particularly gratified to share it with
the founders of the uh Brooklyn for
peace
organization and multiply gratified to
be here on the 30th
anniversary of the
organization that's an achievement uh
that can't be
overemphasized uh if you look around the
country today the number of people
involved in serious forms of activism is
actually quite substantial quite large
and probably greater than at almost any
time in recent years uh but there are
deficiencies uh one of them is that
they're scattered
both in space and in
time in time because very few
organizations have the kind of
continuity and commitment that the
Brooklyn for peace group has had over
these years scattered in space and that
uh uh people don't know each other they
may be working on the same things in the
same Community but they have little
contact and that of course magnifies
across the country country I give lots
and lots of talks but over the years
I've come to feel that one of the most
valuable aspects of these talks is
simply that it brings people together in
the same Community people who don't know
each other they may be in different
neighborhoods working on slightly
different matters but they're related
and uh sometimes is a way to integrate
them the lack of the kind of scattering
in time has another as
it means that uh there's no historical
memory people don't recall what happened
in the past uh every action tends to
begin from scratch with no no
understanding of what worked in the past
what failed and why how to do things and
so on so the Persistence of a group like
this is of extreme
significance another element of that
kind of scattering through time is that
we tend to forget what has happened in
our own history so if you take things
that are very much alive today they have
Deep Roots they've been happening over
and over again through American history
meaning they're kind of deeply rooted in
the institutional structure and the
culture and so on these are things we
have to come to understand so right now
for examp example there's a obvious
confrontation between many working
people and
immigrants That's goes right through
American history far back if you want to
go every group of immigrants that came
in when they became more or less
established resented and fear those who
were replacing them go back to say New
England from Boston in the late 19th
century the Irish
who were regarded as almost like
African-Americans you could read signs
and Resturant saying no dogs in Irish
some of the things that happened are
pretty grest so for example the modern
medical field of
Gynecology was developed by highly
respected uh researchers and Physicians
you can see
their painted pictures portraits of them
on the halls of medical school who were
able to develop the techniques because
they could use life subjects the life
subjects were of course black women but
also Irish women they were considered
Fair subjects by the time the people
from Eastern Southeast Europe were Huns
they were condemned bitterly uh one of
the things that overcame this was work
struggle a constant worker struggle the
great Labor struggles of the late 19th
century 1990s overcame the racist and cl
other ethnic conflicts and brought
people together to work for a common
cause happened again in the 1930s with
the organization of the
CIO uh the US has had very significant
popular Democratic movement the most
important of all probably was the rical
Farmers movement in the late 19th
century very significant movement
developed in Texas and Kansas quite
radical positions a huge movement it
began to create links with the great
workers movement the Knights of Labor
which also had a pretty radical program
that have reached out to huge numbers of
people that was an opportunity for a
real
Democratic I can't say Revival because
it would have been the first time uh in
the United States and it was crushed by
force uh by the 192s after W Wilson's
Red Scare the populist movement BR
Farmers movement had been dis
disintegrated the labor movement was
virtually destroyed one of the great uh
labor historians late David Montgomery
has an important book with some title
like The Fall of the House of Labor he's
referring to the
1920s when the labor movement was
virtually
destroyed uh racist anti-immigration
bills were passed for the first time
there had been Oriental exclusion bills
but the first real General racist
immigration law was
1924 and that was to keep out Jews and
Italians it's kind of Forgotten one of
the reasons why many Jews went to the
extermination camps is they could to be
brought in here United States had racist
laws that blocked them uh that was
overcome finally wa much too late for
many millions of people and it's
reenacted over and over these are things
we should know uh all of you know I'm
sure that there's a huge curse in the
society right now of a criminalization
of black life a huge incarceration rate
Way Beyond anything else in the world
since essentially 19 about 1980 just
about the time this group was formed uh
largely a consequence of Ronald
Reagan's pure racist
trug that's designed that way on pure
racist grounds from police action kind
of thing so in Ferguson recently up till
through sentencing until later policies
made which Clinton instituted to keep
people out of public housing and so on
well that happens to be a reenactment of
what happened after the Civil War as
very similar
to after the Civ there was a period
after the Civil War about a decade when
blacks had some kind of small chance to
enter the society that was over by
1877 when an agreement was reached
between north and south to permit the
South to criminalize black life that the
familiar image is the Chain Gang but was
all over mines Industries a large part
of the American Industrial Revolution is
based on slave labor just as early us
development is based on straight slavery
cotton remember was the the oil the 19th
century and its availability created the
modern industrial society take a look at
the history of American
BS it's five first slaves came in 1619
that's 500 years there's been a few
decades literally during this time when
African-Americans had
a a small chance to enter American
Society on somewhat equal terms you know
scattered elements made it through but
I'm talking about the mass of the
population these are all things we ought
to know we ought to understand that
we've got to comprehend the nature of
the adversary that peace and Justice
movements confront this has always been
a to an unusual extent a business run
Society uh American labor history is
extremely violent hundreds of American
workers were being killed uh right up
through the 1930s at times when nothing
like that was heard of in Europe or
Australia other countries even
right-wing Europeans were a called to
see the way American workers are being
treated and it comes the assault labor
movement did reconstitute itself in the
1930s very significantly that's why we
have a new New Deal measures and so on
right after the war they came under
attack been a huge attack ever since the
labor movement has once again been
substantially
disintegrated left parties have largely
disappeared and that's the basic reason
for the lack of comp
and life of historical memory that goes
along with it well these are all things
that have to be overcome and the
Persistence of a group like this what
Rusty called the instinctive commitment
to effective activism over a long period
30 years that's of no small significant
that can be Pro extended more widely we
have a real chance to break through
the massive problems that we face today
and those are not small
uh there are basically two huge Shadows
that darken everything we pay attention
to or think of one of them is uh what
was in fact the uh the immediate
stimulus for the organization of this
group nuclear
weapons there are some things that
should be remembered at
1983 when this group was formed was one
of those all too many moments when we
came very close to total Destruction
through nuclear weapons the facts should
be known they're not very well known
when Ronald Reagan came into office in
the early 80s one of his initiatives was
to probe Russian defenses to try to
determine what the Russian defensive
systems were and there was a program
Able Archer was called to simulate
nuclear attacks against Russia by air
and sea to try to elicit a Russian
response Well turns out the Russians not
Russian archives have come out we know
that they took it pretty seriously
unlike the United States Russia is quite
vulnerable and this was at a time when
Persian missiles were being installed in
Europe with 5 to 10 minute flight time
to Moscow and a very warlike rhetoric on
the part of the Raven
Administration what we call Star Wars is
understood on all sides to be a first
strike weapon everyone understands that
strategic analysts on all sides
the current virgins again are understood
that way right in the midst of this
period we learned about a year ago
Russian
automated response systems detected an
incoming US missile attack our systems
make hundreds of Errors they're aborted
by human Intervention which has maybe a
couple of minutes to
stop sending of nuclear weapons which CH
everything the Russian systems are
undoubtedly less sophisticated than ours
they did uh report the the automated
systems did report an ongoing missile
attack right in the midst of all of this
the protocol is for the uh information
to be given to a particular human being
whose name happened to be Stan Petra and
he's supposed to hand it over to the
high command which then sends a
Counterattack
he decided not to transmit the
information literally that's why we're
alive
literally uh that's
1983 that kind of thing has happened
repeatedly we're still on the verge of
similar things the uh Obama
Administration has announced a trillion
dollar program for the next couple
decades in upgrading nuclear weapons the
uh threats of the confrontation
us Russian confrontation is not
small these kinds of things could happen
again the other major
threat and very serious one is
environmental
catastrophe it's imminent we can't go on
like this much further it's within
couple of decades the problem has to be
dealt with seriously it's
not uh the major energy corporation next
on mobile really recently just announced
that they're going to devote all of
their resources to what the business or
press calls a laser likee commitment to
extracting every drop of fossil fuels
out of the ground it's well understood
that most of that must remain in the
ground or we're really sunk uh Chevron
another major corporation had a
renewable energy program Small Program
pretty profit able but uh not as much as
fossil fuel extraction so they've
abandoned it and are now fully committed
to fossil fuel extraction you read the
business press say the business section
of the New York Times repeatedly
euphoric articles about the fact that
the United States is now rapidly
increasing its fossil fuel production
it's becoming the world leader we're
beginning to export uh
u oil and diesel fuel abroad will become
the Saudi Arabia of the 21st century uh
under 10 ft of Water by the time it's
over uh there is a
mention occasionally of a of a problem
one story in the times New York Times a
couple weeks ago which was gloating
about the great oil production uh also
pointed out incidentally that this is
reducing prices which is a wonderful
thing because people can drive more and
use you know use more electricity and so
on another story in the Washington Post
reported that the sale of Hummers
basically panks which was dead for a
long time it's now increasing wonderful
things and prosperity the time story did
mention one problem which had actually
described this catastrophic if it occurs
there might be an oil blood there might
be too much of it
that's the world we live in and it just
it's deeply rooted in institutional
structures like you can't really blame
the CEO of Exon Mobile for trying to
destroy the world they have a legal
obligation to do it literally I mean
it's a legal requirement for the CEO of
Corporation to maximize profit and
market share uh
this particular individual doesn't do it
he'll be kicked out and somebody else
will come in and will these are
institutional problems not easy to
dismantle uh if if we can go on and on
uh if you look at popular attitudes a
very important fact is that the public
is opposed to these things uh this is
true in international Affairs like this
consider majority of the public thinks
that the United States should not take
the initiative in international crisis
it should leave it to the United Nations
which is our legal commitment in fact
and uh there's even a small majority in
favor of abandoning The veto at the
security Council and just following
General opinion even if we don't like it
uh a large percentage of the
population overwhelming majority thinks
that the the environmental crisis
serious we have to do something about it
uh these voices
don't influence policy and we have to
ask why there's several reasons and
they're hard to deal with they're not
going to be easy to
overcome one reason is that we simply
don't live in a functioning
democracy uh take a look at academic
political science literature shows
very convincingly that uh about 3/4 of
the population
lowest 3 quarters on the income wealth
scale have absolutely no influence on
policy political their political
representative simply disregarded
there's no correlation between their
their go their goals and their interests
and the policies pursued As you move up
the ladder you get a little bit more
influence when you get to the very top
which is PARTA said was a fraction of 1%
they basically set policy well under
those circumstances doesn't really
matter much what people think uh this
last
election had the lowest participation
since the middle of the second world war
where people weren't voting for lots of
reasons U
nobody's analyzed exactly why but I
think a favorite guess is that without
reading technical articles people are
well aware of the fact that doesn't
matter what they think uh nobody's going
to pay attention to them anyway so I
bother there used to be a quip in the
United States I think it goes back to
seite Mills that the US is a onep party
State the business party with two
factions Democrats and Republicans
that's not true anymore it's still a one
party state but there's only one faction
and it's not Democrats it's moderate
Republicans uh that's the Dem so-called
Democratic party uh the Republican party
has simply drifted off the Spectrum it's
uh one of the leading
conservative commentators most respected
commentators Norman orstein of the
American Enterprise Institute describes
today's Republican party as a radical
Insurgency which is abandoned
parliamentary politics and is very
successful at it the U attack on Obama
which is pretty interesting I mean it's
kind of painful to watch but it's
interesting from a historical point of
view a lot of it's infected by racism
undoubtedly it's a very racist Society
but a lot of it followed a very
successful strategy which was announced
right away strategy was ruin the country
and hope that it'll be blamed on the guy
in the White House
tinged by racist Elements which are
always there it w't uh partly because
the Democrats offered nothing in
response they offered nothing to poor
and working people uh this organization
was founded in 1983 84 that's right at
the kind of onset of the general
neoliberal assault on the population
which has had very harsh effects here
and everywhere else where it's been
applied uh you take a look at
say real wages of uh male workers for
the majority uh it's about like the
1960s uh productivity has increased
sharply but the the results are the
outcome is not going to the people who
are working it's going to a tiny
fraction of the population
who are basically Predators the
financialization of the economy has
created enormous power in the hands of
financial
institutions which for the most part are
destructive to the economy one of the
leading Financial economists Martin wolf
Financial Times pretty conservative guy
describes contemporary financial
institutions as uh like the L
of a spider wasp which eats away at the
host the host being the productive
economy there was a recent study of the
IMF of the six leading American Banks
which found that their profits derive
almost entirely from the government
insurance policy it's not just the
bailouts it's a small part of it cheap
credit High credit ratings all sorts of
things uh the business cres Ates that
gift that you're giving to the banks at
about $83 billion a year uh they
destroying the Predator institutions
supported by the public by all sorts of
ways uh have enormous political power
and are very destructive of the economy
and the social system so why aren't
people doing something well for one
thing their votes don't matter matter
and they know it but there's another
reason which is just as hard to deal
with I think the United States
throughout its history has been a very
frightened Society unusually so goes
right back to Colonial times so you read
say Thomas Jefferson who slave owner of
course but did it some sometimes say we
should do something about emancipation
of slaves but he said there's a real
problem
he said the slaves have 10,000
reminiscences they know the torture that
we've imposed on them and they might
strike back so we're in trouble uh that
right through American popular
literature you see tremendous fear of
Native Americans who Exterminating might
fight back uh slaves who might remember
what we've done to them which is hideous
and
react uh late 19th century Chinese
workers you think they're building
laundries but they're really planning to
wipe us out right up to the
Pres and it
it it it works in the most astonishing
ways like take
Grenada which right right at the time
when this organization was uh Reagan
decided to invade great Powerhouse the
nutman C of the
world people didn't laugh all he had to
do was say there's a somebody's build
the Cubans are building a an air base
commercial air base it turned out and
maybe the Russians might use it to
attack us so therefore 6,000 American
Special Forces had to invade Grenada
receive 8,000 Medals of Honor for their
achievement to overwhelm couple c a
dozen the Cuban construction workers the
Reagan Administration rejected pretend
that it didn't hear Cuban offers to
settle beforehand turned out to be of
course a commercial airline but it
worked a couple years later
1985
Reagan uh declared a National Emergency
in the United States because of the
threat to our national security posed by
the government of Nicaragua
in Nicaragua you those of you are old
enough will recall that he made a speech
or warning that the Nicaraguan Army only
a two days March from harling in
Texas but the important thing is if
people don't laugh and it comes right to
the present take the Ebola scare three
Americans were
infected uh and it's perfectly well
known how to how to
handle the Ebola crisis it's not a
serious one for a society that has any
kind of a functioning Health System uh
countries like Mali and Sudan and the
Democratic Republic of Congo they were
able to handle it without hysteria here
what he vot past
hysteria these things are not
insignificant it means that every
doesn't matter what people think anytime
that the political leadership and of
course the media chime in right away and
the intellectual Community anytime they
announce we're under threat we're about
to be destroyed people huddle Under the
Umbrella of power doesn't matter what
they think that's a part of the reason
for the gun culture there are just lots
of people in the country who think if I
don't bring my gun into church maybe
they'll come after me you know whoever
they are that's not a joke and to
overcome these things requires a a major
cultural change a kind of spiritual
Revival you might call it not a small
test all of these things the lack of
democratic institutions the fact that we
actually live in a plutocracy the
culture the lack of historical memory
the fail to understand the nature of the
adversary that we're confronting these
are hard tasks uh they you can think of
ways in which they can be overcome and
they better we overcome and pretty fast
or we're in deep drou
