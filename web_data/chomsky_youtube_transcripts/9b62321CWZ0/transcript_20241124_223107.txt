full on zoom within 24 hours of it going
up on eventbrite
and thank you finally to my co-chair
sajad and thank you to our speakers
exeter's own
ilan pape and the university of
arizona's professor noam chomsky
we've invited professors pape and
chomsky to discuss the present political
and social impasse
as well as the potential for future
internationalism and radical change
for many of us the outlook appears bleak
in 2021
from the stark inequalities exposed by
the pandemic to the situation in
palestine
where in a world with so much flux and
change
a century of israeli colonization grinds
on
unabated in that tortured land at the
present moment moreover
palestine's international solidarity
movement in the uk
america and elsewhere is subjected to
renewed efforts to silence criticism of
israel
what then should we do where
historically have dissidents found hope
and made progress
and what avenues are yet to be traversed
what tools are available to social
movements
activists and academics to create a
better future in palestine and beyond
we look forward to professor chomsky's
and professor pape's reflections on all
of this
and more in the coming hour um
after some brief introductions uh we
have the
um conversation between uh professor
chomsky and pape
um after about 45 minutes we'll open up
the
room to questions from the um our
viewers both on zoom and youtube
and then we'll close about a half hours
um after that
uh there's a hashtag for the event if
you're planning to share on social media
it is hashtag chomskypope2021.
uh professor rizvi will now lay out the
ground rules for conduct and explain how
to participate in that q a
session thanks colter um
just a few simple things obviously
please do keep yourself
muted through the event when it comes to
the q a session
you can of course um send in your
comments and questions
using the chat function on zoom and also
on youtube
and we will moderate that um please make
sure
that you use well if you want uh your
name to be anonymous
you can of course um uh anonymize
yourself once you're in
in the zoom room uh just um just be
aware that we will use whatever the
screen name comes up
as the the questioner the court has
already mentioned the
hashtag and um i don't think there's
really much else to say
except for that we're all very much
looking forward
to this conversation so let me i guess
begin with
the introductions of our two speakers in
many ways um
they don't need much introduction i'm
sure everyone who is listening to this
is perfectly aware of who
elon paper and chomsky are but
still we should do our due diligence and
of course
this will be a record uh it will be um
it will be on our it's on our youtube
stream
uh and it will remain on the you on our
youtube channel
um for the forthcoming future so let me
just say a few things about
ilan pape our colleague at the institute
of arab and islamic studies
um elan is a professor of history and
director of
the european center for palestine
studies an expatriate
israeli historian although of course at
the moment he is
uh very much in israel um and uh a
socialist activist
um he's one of the new historians who
came to prominence
um on the study of israel palestine in
the 80s
i remember for example a wonderful
perhaps one of the most exciting
seminar series i took part in as a grad
student
was on the new israeli history and in
that i had the privilege actually of
presenting elan's dissertation his first
book
as part of that conversation his
research contextualizes the history of
palestine
in the larger global context of settler
colonialism and challenges the dominant
israeli narrative which in many ways
he's been doing since that time
in addition to his work with the exeter
the
european center for past life studies he
chairs the emile tuma
institute for palestine studies in haifa
and is a founding member of the new
of the new movement the one democratic
state initiative
he's of course the author of numerous
works including the best-selling
the ethnic cleansing of palestine um and
most recently um his 2016 book
the biggest prison on earth a history of
the occupied territories received the
palestine book award
aliens also of course to the
conversation today
is the two works that he wrote with
professor chomsky
one being gaza in crisis and the other
one on palestine
so with that i'll pass over to coulter
who will say a few things about
professor chomsky
uh as sad said correctly it's often said
that noam chomsky needs no introduction
most if not all of you are surely
familiar with his reputation
the breadth and depth of his work is
extraordinary apart from his
groundbreaking work in the
fields of linguistics in the field of
linguistics his meticulous political
writings
cover the realm of american imperialism
media criticism
and the israel-palestine conflict
amongst other things
amongst those works are the two books he
co-authored with ilan
on palestine and gaza in crisis few
people are endowed with chomsky's
formidable faculties
and fewer still direct them so fully in
the service of justice and the end of
human suffering
despite a reputation as the most
important intellectual alive
chomsky has chosen not to build an
intellectual monument to himself
rather he has devoted himself to the
task of resolving the most pressing
political
problems of our age his unwavering
commitment to disengaging truth
from the scheme of lies the powerfulness
have concocted to conceal it
has inspired and informed the work of
untold numbers of young activists and
scholars
present company included uh fellow
listeners i give you noam chomsky
in conversation with ilan pape
great thank you
again apologies for everyone uh for some
technical issues which uh
shows us that uh we are all longing for
normal human interaction with other
human beings
zoom has its failure nom is wonderful
to see you again and to talk to you uh
and thank you again for taking the time
i know how busy you are and
we really really appreciate it and thank
you the team that was
helping uh this meeting and making it
possible since we have already lost some
time i will
just give a general thank you for
everyone
although i prepared a long list by name
alphabetic name but i think we'll skip
it believe me i think every one of you
from the from my heart okay now
so we can start um in 1967
you wrote an article on the
responsibility
of the intellectual a piece of work that
really influenced my life
not immediately i was 12 years old when
the article appeared so
it happened a bit later in 2019
a conference in ucl in london
wishing to discuss this article about
the responsibility of the intellectual
was censored which shows that your
article is still regarded
as dangerous and subversive to the
powers that be
it is indeed one of the many topics you
were engaged with over the years the
responsibility of
intellectuals this continued censorship
on your article
more than 50 years later 53 years later
in fact
raises the question whether much has
changed things
is it possible that the new generation
of intellectuals of scholars maturing
into the 21st century
still shun that responsibility and if i
may add to this before
that you respond on and in this constant
to look beyond britain to the usa and
ask you whether anything has
changed in your view in that part of the
world given the bleak view you
used to have at the time and after 67 on
the complicity
of american intellectuals in the
criminal american policies dating back
to
southeast asia in the early 1960s up to
the present american
involvement in the continued oppression
of the palestinians today
has anything changed in americans
intellectual sense of responsibility
or even in their readiness to assume
accountability
what is done overseas in their name
quite often with their intellectual
support
and as citizens of america also with
their money in a way
as taxpayers are we in a better position
today when it comes to
the courage and commitment of
intellectuals
well let me start by just making a
comment which few people know about the
article you referred to
1967 actually it appeared in 1966
in a place which would surprise you the
journal of the hillel foundation at
harvard university
and that's very significant in 1966
i was giving a talk to the hillel
foundation they
published it in their journal mosaic
since 1967 that would have been
impossible
and that explains some of the ways that
things
change in 1966
it was still possible to talk about
israel palestine in the united states
from 1967 it became
virtually impossible anyone who tried to
mention
it would was a pariah you may
recall in a couple years later in 1972
abba eben the who you all know
foreign minister at the time very
respected
had an article in the liberal
zionist journal the congress weekly
american jewish congress
the article informed american jews
of what their responsibility was
their responsibility was to show that
there is no difference
between anti-zionism and anti-semitism
and anti-zionism and criticism of his
government
the state the labor government in israel
and he gave two examples to show
uh how dangerous this
anti-zionism was two people two
he was talking about what he called
jewish self-hatred
and he gave two examples of jewish
self-hatred
i was one izzy stone i have stone was
the other
dedicated zionist but critical of the
government of israel's policies
so he says on the one hand there are
non-jews who are anti-semites
on the other hand there are jews who are
consumed with
the neurotic jewish self-hatred so that
covers
it covers the spectrum uh anyone
critical of the government of israel is
in any semi
it's this is your duty to
uh show a jewish community uh you've
recently heard that
in uh in england very
prominently same message uh
the way of destroying jeremy corbyn
and a progressive labor party by showing
that anyone critical of israel's
an anti-semite they don't put it in
those words but
that's what it amounts to well how much
of things changed
somewhat so for example until
a kind of a bellwether of american
intellectual opinion
is the new york review of books it's the
major journal of sort of liberal and
less liberal american intellectuals
up until maybe two or three years ago
this regime held it was imp
impossible to discuss the issue
i used to write for the new york review
regularly
but not after i became involved in
publicly in
israel-palestine issues after that
anathema
couldn't possibly it has changed in the
last year or two
strikingly so if you read the journal
now
you can read highly critical articles of
israeli policy typically by israeli
writers
that makes it sort of
tolerable a strong article
by nathan thrall very very strong
article appeared in a recent issue
all of this reflects changes in public
opinion in the united states
and those ultimately reflect themselves
in intellectual opinion and maybe
someday in policy
that's a matter of some significance but
as
israeli policies became more and more
brutal reactionary intolerable
what happened is that general liberal
opinion
you know people who identify themselves
as liberal democrats
has shifted away from the
uh almost
stalinist style support for israel that
used to exist
just reflexive couldn't say a word
it's shifted to actually by now more
support for palestinian rights than for
israel
and it's showing up in the intellectual
journals it's showing up
not yet but it may show up in policy so
support for israel now
in the united states used to be uh
israel used to be the liberal door and i
couldn't say a word about it
i mean it wasn't just not being able to
write
meetings were broken up i had to have
police protection if i
tried to talk about the topic even in my
own university
that's all changed now it's
it's quite possible in these
circles to be very critical of israel
support for israel has shifted
to the evangelical community with a huge
community in the united states and to
ultra-right nationalists military and
security
committed and so on and so forth now
that
does leave opportunities also
for change in the policies
we haven't seen it yet but this has a
way of affecting things
so i think with regard to intel
intellectuals yes there has been
a change largely caused by
israel's violence and brutality i give
talks on this constantly
and you could see exactly when it turned
so
cast lead for example the
2006 israeli invasion of lebanon
had a big effect before that i was still
getting police protection
after that i was getting big crowds same
talks changed quite a lot
and the more israeli
israel moves sharp moves to the right
the more
brutal and harsh its policies get the
harder they are to suppress
the more you're seeing changes in
attitudes also among intellectuals
and to a limited extent in the
press not very much but some well
that's the way things change that's how
uh
what's hap activism on the ground has a
way of
shifting attitudes shifting what's
sometimes called the overton window the
range of things that you're
permitted to talk about within the
mainstream framework
where you can push a little at the edges
and this
could sooner or later have an effect on
policy
if the proper activities are undertaken
so i think it's a very significant issue
not much discussed
but very worth cl looking at quite
closely
actually my friend norman finkelstein
has a book about this came out a couple
years ago
i think you're muted
you can't hear yeah
now now you can hear me sorry uh yes
say that in many ways i would share
share your your optimism although uh
in this country in the in the united
kingdom of course
and maybe because it's much more
prevalent now to
speak openly about palestine uh
there are counter measures taken by
people from from
above and by local lobbies
so the prevent program which you are
familiar with i'm sure
uh is also targeting uh
any any events that deal with criticism
on israel recently we have been
exposed to a different kind of assault
of
freedom of speech when it comes to
israel and palestine
through the new definitions uh of
the holocaust denial where criticism in
israel is
um uh equated with uh
anti-semitism uh with anti-semitism and
denial of the holocaust
just recently the secretary of state for
higher education
uh considered withdrawing you funding
for universities
if uh the definition of the
international holocaust
remember alliance uh for holocaust
denial
would not be endorsed a definition that
as i mentioned before
uh really equates criticism on israel
with holocaust
uh denial so maybe this is a measure of
success uh the fact that um there are
also still at least in the uk uh um
uh some assaults on this on this
question but
um if i may sort of
take it to a different angle of this
debate because we are uh
in a better position now to talk in the
academia
about uh israel and palestine and uh
probably as you say there's some
influence uh
on on the media but i'll come back to
the media
later on uh there is a different angle
to this question when we are
struggling with policies such as prevent
in the uk or the definitions of the
ihra the international holocaust
remember alliance that
tries to stifle discussion on palestine
our students in a recent debate on the
ihra
issue which we had in the institute
raised concern
that echoed concern that i know you had
at the time
on the boycott divestment and sanction
movement the bds movement
and you raised it among other places in
our joint book on palestine
on the one hand there is a wish to
continue
and struggle in this country also i
suppose in the united states
against any uh attempt to silence uh
criticism
uh of israel that is done usually by
weaponizing anti-semitism as a principle
tool of intimidation on the other hand
there is a worry
the freedom of speech rather than the
plight of the palestinians
becomes the main focus of the solidarity
movement
how can we balance both legitimate
concern
indeed without forgetting the primary
motivation for solidarity because quite
a lot
of people sort of feel that one stress
comes at the expense of the other and i
know that
this is some of the criticism that you
had at the time uh
or worries rather it was not criticism i
think was more concerned
uh where uh a focus on freedom of speech
rather than the topic that the freedom
of speech is supposed to serve
uh would would kind of divert the
attention from the real issues
at hand well
it's a constant i think you sh the uh
increase in the intensity
of efforts to silence discussion on this
topic and
recently in the united kingdom i think
that's a sign
of the increased desperation
of supporters of israeli policy
as they see the control of opinion
slipping out of their hands they're
resorting to
harsher and more desperate measures
to try to block any
discussion any condemnation so in a way
it's
sort of a good sign to see the attempts
to
extremism of the attempts to silence
discussion
means situations getting out of their
control
it used to be much easier than england
so just to remind you of an event
back in the 80s which i'm sure you
remember late 80s i think or
maybe 90s don't remember exactly when
uh there's a journal index on censorship
which is concerned with
issues of freedom of expression and so
on
it had been focused about a hundred
percent
on eastern europe on the attempts in
eastern europe to
silence dissidents and so on the editor
of the journal who himself was an
eastern european dissident
decided that it would be interesting to
try to
shift it to open the discussion to
another
area actually an area that george orwell
wrote about uh suppression of thought in
free societies
i should mention that orwell's essay on
this
was suppressed uh it's the introduction
to animal form which was
suppressed came out 30 years later
it was about how in free england
unpopular ideas can be suppressed
without the use of force now
theoretically it's available well the
editor of index
wanted to do the same thing open up
index on censorship just for one
one article on how ideas are suppressed
within free societies
so he invited me and i wrote an
article on how discussion of
israel-palestine is suppressed
in the united states without the use of
force
just by other means the roof fell in
uh he had to retire the journal was
closed
huge attack on the journal for allowing
this to happen
turned out later that it was initiated
by a leading exponent of freedom of
speech
and a person who was in fact an old
friend isaiah berlin
behind the scenes was orchestrating this
attack
uh was denied you know all sorts of
things but it became very clear
well uh the journal was reconstituted
i don't think it has has gone in this
dangerous direction
at least in the years that followed
that was then you could just silence
things
now it's not so easy it's uh
it's harder and therefore the effort to
follow abba evan's advice from
50 years ago and to tar any
criticism of israel with anti-semitism
that's intensifying it's the idea
it's picking up it's you've seen a lot
of it in
england i don't have to report it but i
think it's all reflection of the fact
that indeed israeli policies are
becoming
increasingly difficult to defend
and it's necessary to resort
to means of suppression of opinion if
possible
shifting the topic to anti-semitism to
something else
in order to marginalize it i should say
that
segments of the left very mistakenly
are joining in on this not on this issue
but on other things
what's called cancel culture
is an effort by students
some others to try to prevent the kind
of
talk that they don't want to hear it's
wrong in principle
and it's tactically idiotic
it's a gift to the right wing they love
it
and it uh of course
what it means is those who have the
power will use it for their interests
so yes all these problems arise all the
time
and what you have to do is keep your
eyes on the main
issues the main problem is not
academic freedom in britain and the
united states it's
the plight of the palestinians anything
that diverts attention to that from that
and from what's going on and what we can
do about it anything that diverts
attention from that
is completely wrong we have to focus on
that
and what can be done and there is in
fact
a lot that can be done including things
that are not discussed
possibly because they're so important
when something is
not discussed and is very topical
you should be concerned so there is
something that
on the surface doesn't seem to be
related to israel-palestine
but in fact is very closely related
and that's iran right now
front pages constant talk
great threat of iranian nuclear weapons
programs
supposed programs got to do something
about it
big negotiations in vienna actually
there's something very simple to do
about it
which everyone knows and thinks about
these things
that nobody's allowed to talk about and
it has to do with israel
uh a very simple way to solve
the problem alleged problem of iranian
nuclear weapons
is to institute a nuclear weapons-free
zone
in the middle east that would resolve
the problems
reduce tensions of enormous positive
effects why isn't it done
iran is strongly in favor of it
the arab states have been strongly in
favor of it for
30 years there's the ones who instituted
it
including egypt global south
overwhelmingly in support of it no
criticism from europe they'd go along
with it
it's blocked because the united states
vetoes it
most recently obama and the united
states vetoes it because it does not
want
israeli nuclear weapons to be open to
inspection
in fact the united states does not
acknowledge
their existence though it's not a doubt
and the reason is that american law
would come into play
and raise the question whether all any
us usaid israel is even legal under u.s
law well it's an important point that
could be pushed by an activist group
bring to the american population similar
things in england
the fact that we're facing serious
threats of
war danger in order to
preserve the huge flow
of military and economic aid to israel
and to egypt incidentally to the
egyptian dictatorship which is
connected with this these are things
which have a lot of resonance among
american population
could lead to raising very serious
questions
about the nature of u.s support for
israel
and even a hint of withdrawing any of
that support
would have a big impact on israel's
policies
is very dependent on the united states
for support
has been ever since the 1970s when
israel adopted a very clear policy of
choosing expansion
over security meaning reliance on the
united states for protection
a very fragile system well these are
things that could be done
right away could have a big effect
there are others that you can think of
so yes there are
possible actions within our reach
which would have a major effect on
global politics
and in particular on israel-palestine
rights
necessary to think about them they're
not
presented to you every day in the
newspapers obviously
you have to think them through and see
what the interconnections are
and there are many
yes i i think i i i totally agree i i
think
but part of the reason i think although
i am as or as optimistic as you are
about
changes in in the media reading even the
more respectable american
uh uh media outlets and also in britain
uh and being also a fellow in an
institute for arab and islamic studies
with colleagues who are experts on the
history and present
realities and are in the arab world and
in the muslim world
there still is a sense that even the
best of the media provides a very
superficial sometimes even i would say
malicious
framing of of the arab world for insta
for instance this
idea that sectarianism has been there in
time immemorial in
in the arab world and therefore there's
no hope for any
reasonable rational solution or
that religion in the middle east always
is a fanatic
religion and and those of us who are
studying the history in the present
reality are always
worried how how uh distorted
and how destructive these
images are but i think you're right with
today
there are first of all alternative media
outlets that
emerge in this age of internet that
allow people a different
access to to information and analysis
uh let's hope that the virtual
developments will be as effective
as were developments of social movements
before the age of
internet on the ground thinking about
the mass movement against the war in
vietnam or the
movement for civil rights uh in the
united
states so in this in mind i would like
to move away a little bit from palestine
and um and ask you a little bit how do
you see
the impact of social movements in the
united states
um let's take one what seems to be for
the time being a successful social
movement the black life
matters uh and on the other hand the
ones that
maybe so far the juries is not still out
on that but so far has not been too
successful
like occupy a wall street um
how do you view the future of these
social
movements and if i may add to this how
how do you view the special
circumstances in which we live now
due to the covet 19 pandemic
some people optimistically think that
inadvertently it opened
new vistas and opportunities for
creating
counter alliance of internationalism and
solidarity that challenges the neo
liberal and neo-capitalist
interpretation and praxis
of internationalism based on narrow
economic interest
and projects of privatization and
perpetuate social and economic marginal
marginalization of non-white and
non-elite groups in
society uh is there a new hope
out of the pandemic for counter
internationalism
uh can it take place
only in the virtual world how far can
should it take place on the ground
itself as it did before the age of
internet
uh and and will are you hopeful that
these kinds of mass movements can still
in the future
have the impact on policies from above
and it doesn't matter with whether we
are talking about
domestic policies in america or uh
american foreign policy or other
countries foreign policies
in the rest of the world well let's
take a look at those movements that you
mentioned
best way to think about those question
kinds of questions i think at least is
very
concretely what has been done what can
be done
now take occupy it's widely said that
the occupy movement failed
i was very much involved in it i don't
think it failed
i think it was a big success remember
that occupy
was not a strategy it was a tactic
it was a short term tactic
you can't occupy uh zuccotti park
forever
you can do it for a couple of months
during the
brief period of the occupied tactic
it broke open the issue of
radical inequality which had been
suppressed
it became a major issue it became
one of the things that other movements
focused on
policy began to focus on and so on
that's a breakthrough
it's an achievement more was hoped for
they were activists and occupy were
hoping to move into neighborhoods
carry out neighborhood organizing on
similar issues well
succeeded to some extent not as much as
what was hoped
that's the way movements work take black
lives matter
that's been enormously successful
even before the floyd murder of george
floyd murdered
black lives matter had penetrated
large parts not only the black community
but others
and was remo remarkably popular
had general popularity way beyond what
social movements have
after the floyd assassination it just
exploded
there were massive demonstrations all
over
solidarity blacks and whites together
overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrations
probably
98 a little bit of
property destruction around the fringes
of course that was
what was focused on by the right-wing
media
it had literally two-thirds
popular support in the united states
that is incredible for a popular
movement
it's far beyond what martin luther king
had
even at the peak of his popularity and
it remains very high
of course the right wing is
making extreme efforts to try to
demonize the movement saying it was all
about violence it was
trying to murder whites and so on and so
forth
see that all over just about every
republican
state now right now is
either considering or passing
legislation
to effectively ban popular
demonstrations
so for example the state of oklahoma
just
made it legitimate for the driver of a
car
to hit even to kill demonstrators if
some fake pretense in other words
let's
you should really look at these
legislations their desperation
across the board to try to stop any
popular activism this goes along with
the
parallel efforts in republican states to
prevent voting
to cut back the danger that there might
be popular votes
that's desperation and unfortunately
there is support for it uh trump
was brilliant at uh tapping
the poisons that run just beneath the
surface in american society
bringing them to the surface making them
giving them some kind of justification
at least self-justification and it's
leading to a very serious problem
it's almost half the population which is
now
consumed with terror
about what's called the great
replacement
the white traditional christian
population is being
overwhelmed and destroyed faced with
genocide by
immigrants blacks and so on and so forth
i'm old enough to remember this in the
1930s
it's not funny that's
happening well but that's
part of the rea that is the reaction
to the growth of successful popular
movements
which are having a major impact major
impact uh the sanders campaign
was an astonishing success it broke with
over a century of american political
history
american elections are pretty much
bought
by concentrations of economic power you
can
predict the outcome of an election with
remarkable
high probability simply by looking at
campaign spending
that sanders totally changed that became
the most
popular political figure in the country
virtually one nomination with
no support from uh the uh
uh any uh wealth and power
the same kind of attacks that you saw in
the
in the british media against corbin you
know
either ignoring or denunciation or lies
but he broke through now the head of one
of the most important committees in
the senate budget committee with major
influence others
came in on the sanders wave the
movements are increasing
all of this can continue to happen
now what about the effect of the
pandemic
it's very interesting to look at it
closely it tells you a lot about our
culture and our
level of civilization the question is
the covet epidemic of course is
international
like global warming but other major
property
uh crises there's no boundaries they're
everywhere
it's obvious in the case of covet it's
very striking to see what's happening
it's understood across the board by
everyone
that unless vaccines go quickly
to the poor areas to africa
to asia to those regions
unless that happens the virus is going
to mutate
it's already mutating it's going to lead
to new variants
some of them may be extremely lethal
like ebola
some may be uncontrollable it'll come
back and hit the rich
it'll devastate them that's known
so what are the rich countries doing
about it preventing
vaccines from going to the poor
areas i take a look through the
array of rich countries they're
monopolizing
vaccines even well beyond what they can
use
just storing them up just in case not
distributing them to the poor countries
even though the leadership knows very
well
that it's a suicidal course it's more
important
if you're the leader of a rich country
to guarantee
the profits of big pharmaceutical
corporations
they're what are called intellectual
property rights
than to save yourself from destruction
let alone the ethical issue of
how many africans and asians you're
going to kill
it's amazing to watch tells you
something about the level of
civilization
in the highest circles okay uh
the details are even more astonishing
so actually there is there are a few
countries who are
internationalists one in particular cuba
it's the one genuinely internationalist
country in the world
sends out doctors all over sends out
like when
in north at the beginning of the uh a
year ago
beginning of the pandemic in europe
you'll recall
there was a real outbreak in northern
italy
very serious outbreak northern italy
happens to be
very close to two rich countries
which are in the same union technically
european union that italy's germany and
austria
they at that point had the pandemic
pretty well under control
very rich countries lots of resources
did they send any help to northern italy
go take a look no they're not interested
somebody did cuba
cuba was willing to send lots of doctors
to northern italy to
help out during the pandemic right now
a couple of couple of weeks ago the
u.s department of health and
human services deals with all these
issues
issued its 2020 report
the last report under the trump
administration
full of self-congratulations of course
uh it if you read it closely
there's a very interesting paragraph
buried inside it
it said how the united states is
reacting to
the covet epidemic in south america
which is very severe
in panama severe covet epidemic
they congratulate themselves on having
convinced
pressured the government of panama to
refuse
to re ejected removed from the country
the cuban doctors
who had come to assist because we have
to stop
cuba's malign influence in the western
hemisphere
brazil is a total disaster area
you can read that in the headlines they
don't have vaccines
the united states they praise themselves
for having
convinced the government of brazil not
to accept
russian vaccines that were offered which
are exactly the same as western vaccines
but we have to stop that malign
influence and that's happening worldwide
there are pressures for a people's
vaccine
which will break the monopolies a lot of
the pressures coming from countries like
cuba china
they claim they'll provide free vaccines
whether they'll do it or not i don't
know
the rich and powerful are refusing
the united states has an excess of
vaccines that it can't use
the reason is the there has yet been no
authorization
for the use of the oxford ostrom zenica
vaccine
so it's all piling up in warehouses
well president biden graciously
decided to release some of it to other
countries
which ones canada which is the world
champion in storing vaccines that it
can't use
just has them piled up way beyond the
canoe so let's give it to canada
how about asia africa please
second country that got it is mexico
as part of a bribe to keep to get mexico
to prevent desperate refugees
from fleeing to the american border
that's called generosity in terms of
western civilization
and it's beyond what the european
countries are doing
so what are the prospects for
internationalism
not from leadership maybe on the ground
there can be popular movements
moving towards genuine internationalism
on all fronts whether it's palestinian
rights
abraham of course which somebody
mentioned
saving ourselves from destruction from
the next pandemic overcoming the
desperate crisis of environmental
destruction
can be done it's not going to come from
leadership could become
can come from popular activist pressures
the way everything's happened in the
past so i think
that's what we have to look at
no my last question because i know the
many people who want to
to ask you and i will let them ask
and and this actually ties in with your
final um remark on
where should we hope for for a change
not coming
from the elite uh but rather from
social movements who share international
solidarity share international um
agendas that eventually can influence of
course
local struggles like the one in
palestine
uh for freedom and liberation um
uh and this really is is kind of a
question for our
student community uh either those who
work on decolonization or those who work
on palestine
or people who work on other uh parts
of the world um and i think
that many of them would ask themselves
about the utility
of believing that one can change
politics from above
in their own personal careers
or changing politics from within rather
than from above
or should they hope and maybe even
cherish the prospect of being part of
grassroots movements of revolution
involved in radical
action from below so to speak uh
and by that contribute to more just
society
uh can for instance what you termed many
years ago
as they call perot corporatocracy
be it all reformed from within or one
or can it only be challenged from the
outside this is a question of the career
pattern
for our graduates whose healthy
instincts against injustice
hopefully will stay with them as long as
possible but i think they would be very
happy to hear your general view on it
uh when they especially for our younger
members of the community
when they leave university and decide
what should be the role and place
in the world and this would be my last
question before we open it up
to the audience well the
official line which of course one should
always
view with considerable skepticism
is that changes come from leadership
enlightened leadership views
the situation realistically the
intelligent men of the community men of
course
think things through and decide what's
right and then
they make decisions and they to the
benefit of all
and that's what you learn in school
that's what you read in the newspapers
and so on
there's an element of truth to it when
legislation is passed it's pace
passed in congress or parliament
when decisions are made in corporate
boardrooms they're made in corporate
boardrooms
but why are they made why some decisions
and not
others here we go back to the
popular forces that are changing
the circumstances the conditions under
which
decisions are made so if you leave it to
corporate board rooms they'll
use fossil fuels to the maximum
doesn't matter if it destroys the world
who cares who make more profit tomorrow
it's the nature of the institution they
go to the top
banks they'll invest in fossil fuels
because they can make money that way
okay
but they may they know the consequences
but it doesn't doesn't fit within the
institutional framework
same is true of legislatures on the
other hand
if the corporate board rooms look out
the window
and see what they describe as
in their terms the peasants coming with
the pitchforks
in polite terms it's called reputational
risks meaning we're in trouble
then you'll get something that we see
over and over
uh groups of leading ci ceos
a major business group saying
addressing the public and saying yes we
realize we've made mistakes
but now we're going to overcome them
we're going to be called to become
what used to be called soulful
corporations who are going to work for
the benefit of the common good so
trust us and go home and they'll
actually do something
which is not meaningless you can press
them
to do things that are worth doing like
maybe getting the banks to
cut back investment in fossil fuels on
the other hand if you look closely
look closely when say exxonmobil
says okay we're gonna we realize we did
something wrong we have to work on
renewable energy and take a look at the
details
now they're putting money into renewable
into sustainable energy
how carbon capture
that is technologies which will allow
them
to continue to use fossil fuels to the
maximum
because maybe somehow somebody will
figure out a way to get the poison out
of the air
after we put it in those are the things
you'd be looking for
same in the political system there are
people in the political system who
genuinely
want significant change in the united
states we just saw it
two days ago
alexandria ocasio-cortez one of the
young representatives came in on the
sanders wave
she and ed markey senior
senator from massachusetts has been
interested in the environment
all his career the two of them just
instituted
legislation on a green new deal
which is exactly what has to be done
detailed feasible worked out
as to how it would work better life
better jobs
overcome the climate crisis okay it's
now on the legislative agenda
that's as a result of a great deal of
activism on the part of mostly young
people
like extinction rebellion in the united
states sunrise movement
in england and sunrise movement the
united states and so on
that's how things change okay so yes
decisions are made in the senate
in parliament in the corporate
boardrooms but under
circumstances and conditions which are
established
to a significant extent by popular
action and activism and demands
there's that interaction is there it's
always been there
will continue to be so it's not one or
the other
but both
yes and i'm thinking about betty
mccollum i think
who initiated legislation about abuse of
children's right in in the occupied
territories
as part of a new uh condition for
american support and so on so so
definitely there is
uh a positive energy also for some of
the younger
generation in the house of
representatives uh
thank you very much noam for this part
uh
i can already see fantastic questions in
the chat
box so i hope you you can still be with
us for
for a short while and we'll take some of
the questions and answer is that okay
it's okay but i have to tell you that i
have a
12 o'clock talk in brazil that's the way
it works these days
where in the world uh we make sure that
uh at least you have
if we give you five minutes before that
is that okay or you want ten minutes
before that
twelve o'clock my time seven yeah so it
should be
finished at 12 o'clock your time or
before
a little before i know maybe four okay
so we'll finish about
six to seven minutes before is that okay
that would work fantastic we'll make
sure about that i'm sure
i'm sure the organizers heard it so make
sure that
we wrap up uh at about ten to seven to
the hour uh
and we release professor chomsky for his
third uh assignment today
okay and this is just the morning i
think in arizona
so uh here we are uh um
uh who uh is it calter or sajad to take
over
i'll start things off uh thank you to
both of you for that uh wonderful set of
um exchanges uh there are plenty there
lots of questions to come in and we'll
try and
deal with as many as we can in a short
period of time let me kick it off with
uh
one question which is to both of you
from our colleague mustafa beg
which is how the abraham accords ended
any
little remaining club of palestinian
statehood
and what might these accords mean for
the future of the middle east
should i start yeah
well the abraham accords which have been
greatly hailed in the west as a major
step forward
are in effect bringing to the surface
arrangements that had long existed
tacitly among the most reactionary
states in the region
uh the gulf dictatorships uh
uh cece's egypt the the most brutal
dictatorship
in is in egypt's ugly history
trump's favorite dictators he called him
60 000 political prisoners in jail
golf dictatorships they don't talk about
you know about that
their passive relations with israel
have now been brought to the surface and
formalized
israel itself has moved so far to the
right
that it fits in very well with the
alliance of reactionary states
so this is uh from the point of view of
the united states which pretty much
orchestrated it
it's part of the geostrategic
program of the trump administration
uh not that different from its
predecessors
to create a reaction and a lie an
international reliance of the world's
most
reactionary states headed in washington
middle east sectors the abraham accords
brings in people like modi and
india destroying indian secular
democracy
crushing muslim rights destroying
kashmir is a perfect candidate bolsonaro
in
brazil where i'm going to be talking in
20 minutes denouncing
their government that's a trump clone
basically so
that's a member so put all this together
as uh and part of it is in the middle
east part is
uh organized so as to
combat what's called the threat of iran
uh the main threat of iran is it doesn't
subordinate itself to this system
it's a deterrent ugly regime but not the
only ugly regime in the neighborhood by
any means
that's not the reason uh so that's
that's
basically what the abrahamic chords are
of course it
kicks the palestinians in the face kicks
the kurds in the face
uh anybody who's weak and defenseless
gets kicked in the face and power
systems that's their nature
but it's by no means the end of the road
there's a lot of options available i've
mentioned some there's plenty more
yeah i would just add to this mustafa
that uh
it's important to remember that uh the
arab regimes do not represent i think
in most cases what their societies would
have liked the government's policies
towards israel to be
uh and it didn't start with the
abrahamic code it
goes back to the cold peace between
israel and egypt in the late 1970s
through their peace with jordan in 1994
you cannot overcome the problem of
having an
alien rogue state in the middle of the
middle east
by just having strategic alliances
with authoritarian elites
if israel is really seeking
reconciliation
with the middle east it will have to
seek reconciliation
with the people of the middle east not
the governments of the middle east
and that reconciliation will only go
through a just solution for the
palestine question
thank you okay
um we have a second question for
professor chomsky though given the
nature of the question i think it's fair
if professor
pape uh also gives his gives us his
thoughts
um and says um from atella via zoom
as a palestinian i think that the
current palestinian political strata
and other centers of power within the
palestinian society
are hindering many moves towards more
freedoms on the social and political
levels
this in turn weakens the whole society
and its ability to stand against the
occupation in its arms
how should we challenge that from within
palestinian society
well that's for palestinians to answer
i don't have answers to palestinians but
what they ought to do i have my opinions
but no particular reason why they should
pay attention to them
they know better than i do i mean
there's some things that are obvious
like the hamas
fatah conflict has to be resolved
every time they've tried to resolve it
israel's intervened to try to prevent it
they don't want it resolved
there are other conflicts that have to
be resolved but
i would just throw this question to
where it belongs
into the lap of the palestinians
i i i agree let's let's move to the
the next question
colter do you want to do the comments
question as well
okay sure um this one's from uh kanwal
hameed from zoom as well
to both thinking about your comment
about how extremely right-wing israel
has become
i wonder what is the limit of the left
in the context of a colonial state
can you really conceive of a future in
which decades of palestinian resistance
achieve their goals of liberation
and return of refugees while the
structures of the settler colony
continue to exist
even in a different way
you want to go elon okay
i will start i i do think that
um there is very little hope
uh in the near future for any change
from within israel i don't think this
is the one thing that will bring in
in the first place any change in the
reality of israel in palestine this is
why i strongly
uh believe in pressuring israel uh and i
do support
the vds movement uh despite the
constructive criticism we heard from
professor chomsky on this um
and and i think that definitely the left
still has
a role to play in organization
uh in building grassroots movements
that eventually could create a joint
agenda
uh for the liberation of palestine
so so in this respect i i think that
uh this is not so much a matter for
change from within although everybody
has
his or her role to play i still would
like to see
a unity on the palestinian side a change
in the international
community's attitude to palestine i
think only then
i would hope to enhance a change from
within
because there is already a potential for
a different point of view within the
jewish society
but i think it needs these other
processes to take place
before these protect before their
potential would uh
be fully exhausted and become
constructed
i would just like to re-emphasize elon's
last point
changes in the international community
which are what should concern us because
we can do something about it
we can't do much about things happening
elsewhere we can do something about
where we
are we can help create
changes in the international environment
to which israel will respond in many
ways
and be more supportive of groups moving
within israel they're marginal but
they're there
moving towards some decent solution we
can stop supporting the most
reactionary harsh brutal elements
that's what we can do
can i actually ask both of you um my own
question
and that's about something very recent
um
what do you think the significance is of
the conviction of derek chopin for the
murder of
um george floyd um i mean do you do you
think it
uh it can also maybe tell us something
about how
we should organize our internationalist
solidarities as well
well it tells you a lot you should look
at the reactions
uh the uh on the part of
obviously afro-american community uh
the general political community on the
more or less
humane liberal sector of the population
saying okay we finally achieved
something now let's go on to the next
take a look at the conservative reaction
uh people like alan dershowitz for
example who you know
call him today saying uh it was an
illegitimate judgment the judge should
have called a mistrial
because the uh somebody in black
congresswoman
maxine waters made a very harsh critical
comment
uh saying if the jury doesn't act the
right way
we'll carry out violence okay
that means it was a mistrial the jury
was intimidated it doesn't mean anything
you're the same on fox news uh the real
problem is the persecuted whites
the person who's defending us from
criminality is
uh charged by an intimidated jury
intimidated by these black left maniacs
who are destroying the country
okay so it in intensifies the incipient
civil war that's going on and it's kind
of like a civil war
serious uh i presume
i haven't seen reactions from abroad yet
but i wouldn't be surprised if they're
similar
yes sir i think even before the trial
the ripples
of this event reached even the united
kingdom i think
we would not have been talking about
black history
uh in in britain and revisiting the
british
curriculum in curriculum high schools
about
the role of britain in the in the slave
industry and so on
and without surprisingly without that
event even before it came to to the
tribe
i'm even more optimistic in the sense
that
uh taking black lives matters all
together
and and the response to both the murder
and the tribe
there is a shift in the african-american
community
and they are much more intersectional in
their view of the world
it began in ferguson i remember when
they saw the connection between
the behavior of the police and the
behavior of the israeli army in the gaza
strip and
there was a demonstration in the gaza
strip in support of ferguson
this kind of intersectionality where the
african-american community can play a
very important role
uh given the role of the united states
not only in the affairs of palestine but
in the first of the arab world
all together and maybe even beyond i
think that this is the
the real democracy we are looking for
the american spring not just for the
arab spring we're looking for that
spring
where american policy will begin to
represent
uh impulses and drives for justice
uh and uh would change that policy
i think we we should wrap up maybe with
a short question if there is one
and and then we should release the
professor
yeah the last question is a follow-up um
to professor
chomsky's comments on global
vaccinations from
ruben timmerman on zoom how do you see
israel's responsibilities with respect
to vaccines in palestine
and how do you respond to the israeli
claim that the palestinian authority is
responsible for administrating that
vaccine
and that the palestinian authority uh
had refused israeli assistance in doing
so
well we should recognize that there are
two different opinions about
israel's responsibility in the occupied
territories
one is the opinion of every
international
legal authority of any standing
all the governments in the world
saying including the united states
saying
israel is the occupying power it has the
responsibilities
under lots of conventions of uh
being responsible it has the
responsibility to take care of the
occupied
of the population under occupation
that's one view
the second view is that of the israeli
government essentially in isolation
saying not our responsibility and we
don't occupy it
uh just a temporary administration we
don't have any responsibility
their responsibility so you can take
your choice
do you want to stand with every legal
authority in the entire world or do you
want to stand with the government of
israel
that's the answer to the question
thank you very much thank you
i think yes we are uh who's going to
make the concluding remarks
um well just to just of course thank
both of you professor chomsky and
professor
pape thank you to all of those who
joined us on zoom and also
who have been following the live stream
on youtube
of course um if you missed it and if you
know anyone who missed it
please do direct them to our youtube
channel the instagram and islamic
studies youtube channel where
this video will remain live what it will
remain
a presence there for people to watch
later and
i guess with that just thank you to
everyone who's joined us thank you for
the conversation i hope this will
um you know provoke many future
conversations and we'll continue talking
about this and i hope
that the very theme of international
solidarity is something that we
we continue to embrace uh especially in
the time of covert
it's so important for us to to actually
uh work from
from below uh to to activate this so
thank you everyone
and uh have a have a wonderful evening
rest of the day to all of you who've
watched thank you
thank you and uh good luck with the
brazilian crowd thank you bye bye
