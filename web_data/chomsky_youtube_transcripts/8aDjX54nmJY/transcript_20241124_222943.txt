Iran has separate problems. The immediate problem is to free Iranian society
from the harsh cruel repressive clerical stranglehold of the clerical regime.
That's what the Women, Life, Freedom movement is about to achieve.
till minimal rights are achieved for participation in the society
The broader questions of capitalism and colonialism can not be seriously confronted because
the population has no means of engagement.
Hello Mr. Chomsky.
First of all, I want to thank you Mr. Chomsky
 for accepting our invitation
and for attending
this session about Iran's future
In recent months Iran has experienced some social protests so called the Woman, Life, Freedom movement and
it has raised many questions about the future of Iran and what is going to happen.
In 1979, a revolution was happening in Iran with
the notion of anti-imperialism and anti-capitalism
some people believe that these notions helped the regime to repress the protests
that call for social and political change and seek its notion of freedom, democracy and human rights.
Sometimes this repression is happening by linking these protests to the western culture and so on
therefore some people believe
that the Woman, Life, Freedom
is an answer to this kind of repression
in the recent four decades in Iran
and is trying to call for equality and democracy and freedom and bring it to the center of politics in Iran
In this conditions it seems that
there is some sort of dichotomy in the Iranian society
between fighting with imperialism and fighting for democracy
How do you see the dichotomy?
you might pay attention
to what they actually are
 because the
issues of capitalism and exploitation
are right at the heart of the crises
of the western societies today.
and they will be for Iran
if Iran can free itself from the cruel clerical dictatorship
Iran has an immediate problem of the Women, Life, Freedom problem.
and minimal conditions have to be established for
open participation in a free participatory society before these other questions can arise.
If Iran is looking to the west for some kind of model to achieve
the first thing it should do is to find out
what has been happening in the west since 1979.
tremendous events happened in Iran.
The Iraq war the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people.
chemical weapons, brutal sanctions
harsh repressive clerical regime imposed
all of that has been happening for cutting Iran off by imperial power from the rest of the world
same time things have been happening in the west
The west has been subjected the western democracies to 45 years of
harsh class war called neoliberalism.
policies that have been designed to transfer wealth to a tiny section of the population.
while the rest of the population with a woman majority moves to
precarious uncertain employment
for male workers real wages are actually lower than what they were in 1979
if you want to get an estimate of what it's like
the highly prestigious [...] governmental rent corporation
just did a study of transfer of wealth in the last 40 years
from the lower 90% of the population to the top 1%
and the estimate is about 50 trillion dollars. That's a very effective class war.
at the same time policies have been designed to deindustralize western countries.
United States which used to have industrial production have collapsed
and the same things happened in Britain and to a certain extended Europe.
Europe is now in fact facing deindustrialization as a result of the
policies of confronting Russia
This is the left societies which are  where there is tremendous anger  resentment
chaotic cultural situations fertile to reign by demagogues.
This is not a model that Iran wants to emulate.
Iran has separate problems. The immediate problem is to free Iranian society
from the harsh cruel repressive clerical stranglehold of the clerical regime.
That's what the Women, Life, Freedom movement is about to achieve.
till minimal rights are achieved for participation in the society
The broader questions of capitalism and colonialism can not be seriously confronted because
the population has no means of engagement.
There are some steps forward in this regard.
The Chinese intervention to lead to a Saudi-Iranian accommodation of some kind
could be a substantial relief.
could mean at some of the
external constraints on Iranian
society and its development
might be somewhat limits
lifted. Might offer an opportunity
for internal forces to have
more range and freedom
to achieve the basic freedoms that are
essential for a society to move forward.
Iran has many possibilities as compared to say with Saudi Arabia.
Women have problems in Iran but nothing like in Saudi Arabia.
 You don't have
women mathematicians in Saudi Arabia winning international prizes.
You don't have the majority of students in advanced universities being women in Saudi Arabia.
You can't get a taxi cab in Saudi Arabia driven by a woman
There is enormous problems in Iran but Saudi Arabia in many ways is even more repressive.
but now the two societies if they can begin to accommodate to extract themselves from external control
may have an opportunity to move towards a middle east that is more free and independent.
I should mention that aside form all the topics we're talking about
There is an immense irremediable problem that may make all of this completely moot.
That's simply boiling of the environment
Take a look at the eastern Mediterranean region
a region of so called MENA countries: Middle-east, North Africa including Iran
This region is heating about twice as fast as the rest of the world.
The latest projection has just few weeks ago by madely Israeli scientists and international scientists
are that the eastern Mediterranean sea level
will rise by 1 meter within the next 30 years
and by 2 and 2.5 meters by the end of the century.
take a look at the settlements. It also affect the Persian gulf.
much of the countries will be unviable. That's not far away.
and this is the center of the oil production which is producing the catastrophe along with the United States.
which now is under shale
production, is the leading producer
of fossil fuels that are
destroying the environment.
so there is a background issue
which can not be forgotten.
It's gonna destroy everything in the region unless this is quickly taken care of it.
That means that these societies of the Middle east that includes Iran and Saudi Arabia in particular
right at their borders the main oil producing and petroleum producing region in the world
They are going to have to both move quickly and expeditiously to eliminate the use of fossil fuels.
if they don't, there is no
future for the whole region in fact for the world.
That is a problem that can't be ignored.
How to do this is by no means easy
but that has to be a prime concern of development, social change economic
change for all the countries in the region.
well that's on top of the desperate need to achieve elementary human rights: to eliminate the sanctions regime.
brutal savage sanctions regime which is destroying the Iranian economy
moving towards a multi polar international system
and which it won't be simply dominated by overwhelming US hegemony ability to
impose harsh sanctions to attack countries that get out of line
all of these things have to be unraveled at many levels and it has to be done quickly.
There isn't much time.
There is immediate problems facing Iran of direct repression and violence
but there in the context of far broader problems, They have to be part of the conversation and thinking
as to how to reconstruct radically the societies of the region even so that they can survive.
so that there's immediate problems
can be addressed.
all of the other problems of repression of minorities the Kurds in Iran and the Balouchis.
all of these problems converge. it's a mass of problems. interrelated in many fashions
and the core of them is moving
Iran towards creating a social order.
in which the population
can freely engage and participate.
Another complication that we're facing with is that some parts of the population
after this movement think that dealing with the regime
is totally useless and the regime won't be reformed
and therefore there's no other way rather than using violence for radical change
any other way is in vain in to reform the current political structure
This is one part of the people. On the other hand
another part of the population, considering the strategic enemies of Iran such as Israel,
believe that any kind of weakining the regime
will lead to unceratain and chotic situation that will be worse.
This group believes that the regime must get powerful first
and then we may solve the problems
and then we can go over other priorities
such as democracy and human rights or enemies will destroy Iran and Islam and our culture.
How should people priorities with regard to these problems?
What do you think about this new group and the legitimacy of some kind of valid violence?
There is no primary or secondary. All of these problems have to be addressed.
non-violent majors inside Iran have not of course succeeded in overthrowing the brutal clerical regime
That's not an argument for moving to violent methods which would be even worse.
You move to the arena of violence the advantage is on the part of those who have the comparative advantage in violence.
That's not the general population. So, what harsh repressive systems delight in
is moving confrontation to the level of violence. That's where their strength is.
their weakness is in areas of non-violence. Those are the
directions in which popular movements must move not only in Iran but in everywhere else.
From a simple tactical point of view you don't move toward tactics
in which the enemy has overwhelming power rather you move towards tactics
in which the enemy is weak and that is popular mobilization non-violent activities.
in which you can't just count on guns to repress it.
And now there are opportunities with the Chinese intervention to bring about
some kind of accommodation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major countries in the region
that offers openings that can be
pursued.
one move that can be made, you mentioned Israel and its threat to
attack, the Israeli threat to attack
and it's true. Israel is moving farther to the right
United States and Israel are both desperate about the accommodation between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
that breaks up regional system of control which goes back to the WWII
or the period of the basis of power in the region
as been a US-Saudi-Israeli lines. it's now breaking up
with China moving in and it's not just Saudi Arabia. United Arab Emirates
other major powers in the region is a focus of the maritime silk road.
China, remember, has two major development projects moving through the Eurasia.
one is the belt and road initiative so called new silk road
integrating much of Eurasia into the Chinese dominated development and investment system
the other is the maritime silk road which runs through the oceans along the border of the southern Eurasia which is
into the gulf and the focal point of it is the UAE.
That's been a central piece for the China’s expansion program.
now Saudi Arabia is joining in
and in fact in an odd way even Israel is
China owns about half of the ports of Haifa.
The main port which is the US naval base. US doesn't like it. All of these changes are taking place
not just in the region it's taking place internationally.
Take the war in Ukraine. The United States has been trying very hard
to get the countries of the global south to join the US in what in fact has become a proxy war between
The US and Russia over Iranian-Ukrainian buddies.
The world is totally refusing
There was a major conference in Munich
Munich strategic conference in February
Where US representatives, vice president Kamala Harris, and other representatives
tried to bring a global south to join the US in confrontation with Russia
every single country refused. India, Indonesia, African countries, even the close US allies
in Latin America like Columbia, Brazil totally refused. This is not our war.
We want to move towards negotiated settlement.
a diplomatic settlement in Ukraine. We refuse to accept the sanctions.
We are continuing to making other arrangements including
currency arrangements outside the dollar system. Whole system is breaking up.
Indonesia and India are major countries
They can't be simply ignored any more than the Saudi Arabia
UAE can't be, It's a fragmenting
that offers serious opportunities for Iran
Iran has joined the China cooperation organization.
but it can move towards overcoming what has been a critical problem for Iran.
The threat of a military attack. Notice what that's based on
It's based on the alleged threat of Iran to develop nuclear weapons.
very simple answer to overcoming that problem. It's well-known but it's not discussed.
Can't talk about it in the West. Very simple answer.
Nuclear weapons free-zone in the region.
imposing nuclear weapon free-zone in the region with extensive inspections
We know that they work. They worked very well during the JCPOA period.
Couple of years before the US dismantle the nuclear arrangement.
even US intelligence agrees that inspections were working very effectively, can work.
....chattering voice....
....chattering voice....
... attempts of Israel and the United States.
to threaten Iran with sabotage assassinations military attack and so on.
It's been right on the verge of implementation for 30 years.
That Arab States are strongly in favor of it. Global south is overwhelmingly in favor of it.
G77, 130 countries of the global south, strongly advocated.
Iran has pretty much supported it, not strongly as it could, but it's given at least tacit support.
Europe is in favor of it. it's vetoed by the United States at every international meeting.
Most recently by President Obama in 2015 subsequent meanings
and the reason is very simple. US doesn't want Israeli nuclear weapons
to be open for inspection.
in fact the US doesn’t even formally concede
that Israel has nuclear weapons. Can't do that because that would
bring in American law which would make Israel
illegal under US law and these are political party in the United Stated
has been willing to open that door. The things are changing. Take a look at
polls in the United Stated on Israel and Palestinians. There has been a radical change.
has not affected policy yet, but in a
relatively democratic society elect in the United Stated
popular opinion can't be ignored forever. Take a look at the younger population
high school and college called generation Z, They off split 50-50
on support for Palestinians and Israelis
sharply different from what happened before and it's increasing
Take a look at the party support among democrats. Large majority
support Palestinians more than Israel. Support for Israel used to be based
in liberal democratic American society. It has changed overwhelmingly,
Now the support is based in the evangelical community
just similar to the ultra religious elements in the Saudi Arabia in the military and security systems.
which has very intimate relations with Israel. very close And the the ultra nationalist right.
That's a huge change. very unstable. It means that the whole
complexion of American policy towards the middle east might be facing a substantial change
The Chinese intervention to move towards some kind of Iranian-Saudi accommodation is another force
could move in ... move of the UAE to be part of the Chinese-based maritime silk road is another.
Break away of the global south India, Indonesia
Columbia, Brazil, Brics countries from the US dominated system is another force
All of these forces are in operation gives I think an immediate
desperate serious problems in Iran of overcoming vicious savage repression
have to be concede, perceived who is in this broader framework
which is going to have major effects on the conditions under which the Iranians politics
can be conducted. And again I say once more
that unless the fossil fuel system is quickly brought to an end, it's all moot.
nothing is gonna change.
You just talked about the negotiations between Iran and Saudi Arabia
and its role in improving Iran's relations with the world
One of the points that has been mentioned by intellectuals
is that the negotitations with Saudi Arabia is
connected to the Iranian politicians' vision of the new world order
the order which they believe Asia is the first power in it
China will rise and America will decline. This is a rising belief that is spreading among people
and has affected political decision inside Iran.
Are these predictions about the future serious?
Is it rational to invest in such predictions?
How can it help Iran's relations with the world?
first of all we should be clear about the
development of global society. There is a lot of talk about the decline of the United States and the rise of China
This has been going on for 30 years and hasn't happened.
The United States' overwhelming power remains
You can see it. China is indeed developing with investment
lending development programs throughout Eurasia region as far as
Iran as far as Turkiye maybe even as far as Hungary
China's setting up a major battery program into Africa
into South Asia even in the Latin America where China is
a larger trade partner than the United States right in its backyard
but that's only part of the story. one part.
The other part of the story is that US hegemony is in fact overwhelming.
There is a lot of talk about how China economically is
reaching a point where it may approach US economic power. It's very misleading.
If you take a look there's been a tendency among the international economists
to measure the economic power of a country by its GDP
[it's] highly misleading in a globalized world
If you look at another measure who owns the wealth of the world?
which multi national corporations own the wealth of the world it turns out that about
50 percent of world wealth is owned by multi nationals based in the US
That's a different measure of the economic power. If somebody has an iPhone let's say
it's assembled in China but the profits go to Apple. They go to partly Foxconn.
Huge Taiwanese conglomerate and organizes the production
but the basic profits go back to Apple corporation which has the patents and design
the so called rent for many parts. That's economically. Take a look militarily.
There is no comparison. The US outspends the next 10 countries combined.
Nobody is even close. Far more advanced technologically.
moving into spaces and control systems.
Now take a look at the geopolitics of NATO seemed to be
tottering before the Ukraine war. Putin's invasion of Ukraine
was an enormous gift to the United States. Enormous gift in many respects.
First of all just militarily at a small fraction of a classic military budget
The US is able to seriously degrade and undermine the military forces of its main military opponent.
That's a bargain. There is plenty of gloating about it in the US. On top of that
Russia is being economically harmed. Ukraine is being devastated
Europe is moving towards a kind of deindustrialization. Even the Economist magazine
warns that Europe is facing deindustrialization as it loses its natural trading partners in the east.
Remember this. The German-based industrial system in Europe which has been so successful
depends critically on minerals and resources from Russia
and access to the huge Chinese market
which is a bigger market for the EU than the US is. It's been broken by the war
In fact what's happened is that Europe has been driven more into US control
US minerals is profiting enormously. Instead of cheap gas from Russia
Germany has to get very expensive LNG from the US.
enormous profit for the energy corporations.
They've never had such a profit over the years including Saudi Arabia incidentally? Biggest profits ever.
and the US is just doing wonderfully from the war the rest of the world is suffering
NATO: not only have the European countries subjected themselves more significantly to the NATO meaning US control
but NATO itself has expanded to a global system. The last NATO summit in February
extended NATO to the indo-pacific region. For the first time US Asian allies were brought into the NATO summit meeting
Japan, South Korea, all of this is now part of NATO.
Global system in the pacific huge military naval operations
re-impact a call in the pacific region
and the China official US policy - we just keep to the official terms- are to encircle China
with a ring of [...] states. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Guam, Australia military bases.
Newzealand military forces in the China with high-tech precision weapons provided by the US.
Quit apart from this the US under the Biden administration has declared an economic war into China
A war to try to prevent China from developing for generations by removing any access to the high quality technologies
semi-conductors, chips that are needed for advanced industry.
Now this is quite a complex issue. The supply chain for these systems extend to all over the world.
You think you have an iPhone but the pieces of it come from everywhere when you look at it
So now if the US is now trying to compel Europe, Japan and South Korea
to break their commercial relations with China the idea is to harm China.
it's gonna be a very severe blow to Samsung and South Korea, to Japanese industry, to the Netherlands in Europe.
Netherlands has the most advanced lithographic industry in the world which creates crucial parts for semi-conductors
They are all being instructed by the US. You have to lose your major market
What's gonna happen to them? They are gonna seriously decline if they accept
If they don't accept we have a break up of the US dominated western order
including its Asian allies
Japan South Korea and Australia
All of this is right on the horizon. There are major developments taking place in the world
US high military faciles, generals are saying we're going to have a war with China in 2 or 3 years.
a war with China is the end of the world. Nuclear powers can't have war and destroy everything. impossible.
There cannot be a war with major nuclear powers but That's what we're talking about
This is the world that we're facing. you're sitting in Iran you have immediate problems which are very serious
poisoning girls in schools, it's not a small problem
but it's within the context of enormous changes in the world system which are gonna
set the context in which struggles within Iran will have to precede. There isn't an isolation.
The world is changing radically we don't know where to move in but these potential conflicts are
extraordinarily serious may break out into major conflict at any time
I mean that's only part of it. Take South Asia.
Pakistan is barely surviving under radical climate change.
one third of the country was under water couple of months ago
hopelessly endured nearby an India poor peasants are living in mudheads in rajasthan
trying to survive heat approaching 50 degree centigrades(Celsius).
unlivable of course in an air conditioning
not even 10 percent of the population of India is air conditioning. That's only the very rich.
These are the glaciers in the Himalayas which are the water source for both Pakistan and India are melting
These are two nuclear armed powers. They are in desperate conditions locally but they are nuclear armed.
They are gonna be confronting and the question is who is gonna control the ...
There is gonna be unlivable unless something is done seriously. It's not very far from Iran
Well, Can't overlook these problems. The problems of Iran themselves are very serious
but within a context of developing problems throughout the world which are going
to determine whether organized human society can even survive very long.
One thing you said was about nuclear arms. There are many opinions about the level of enrichment in Iran.
and some believe that maybe Iran is moving toward developing an atomic bomb
to defend itself against foreign pressures
How do you see these predictions and what will happen with an atomic Iran?
well. I'm not. of course I know nothing about the internal thinking of the clerical guardian council who is making policy
but if they are planing to develop a nuclear weapon which I rather doubt but if they are
for Iran that's suicidal. Iran can do nothing with a nuclear weapon.
If Iran even begin to prepare to mount a weapon on a missile the country would be destroyed.
The US and Israel are just almost salivating with gleam hoping for that opportunity.
and that would give an opportunity to the US to carry out a major attack against Iran
If it began to even think about using nuclear weapons
so that if they're thinking rationally in planning circles
They will not be planning to develop a nuclear weapon. It's not a deterrent for anything
That's just an open call for being destroyed and doesn't have to be bombing
can be by missiles. All sortS of ways to destroy a country which has no defenses.
so what Iran ought to be doing is pressing hard to try to
move to establish a nuclear weapon free zone in the entire region.
that again if you're thinking tactically, you go to your enemy's
weak spot not its strong spot. The strong spot of the US and Israel
is means of violence. That's where they are overwhelmingly powerful
Their weak spot is popular concerns for decent survival.
Now almost the entire world is for 30 years has been supporting a nuclear weapon free zone in the middle east.
US and Israel are blocking it. In the US you cannot even discuss it literally.
because its too dangerous if this becomes a topic of public discussion,
the whole system of control erodes and collapses because it's such an obvious simple solution
to whatever the problem is supposed to be about Iranian nuclear programs
That's what you should be pressuring, your enemies weak point not the strong point.
Just as in the internal tactics, similarly in the international thinking
the move towards some sort of accommodation with Saudi Arabia offers new opportunities
Saudi Arabia doesn't arm with the destroying nuclear weapons.
It's an awful country in many ways but it's not suicidal
There is a way to stop the development of nuclear weapons in both countries
If Iran were to move towards a nuclear weapon Saudi Arabia would as well
Israel of course has overwhelmingly nuclear capacit. If you want to stop that right away
by moving towards the obvious solution which is blocked only by US and Israeli opposition.
powerful in military force not in political force.
You might take a lesson from the Vietnamese resistance to the US
was well understood in the early 1960s including by US intelligence
that US was fighting a military war in south Vietnam
and the Vietnamese were fighting a political war not a military war of course they defended themselves
but they were fighting a political war on the ground that led such events as the so called Tet offensive
most incredible popular uprising in human history which made it clear to US military they cannot win this war
and began to pull out. well on their lessons there, you move towards
where your opponent is weak not towards where they're strong and the weakness of the US and Israel
is the moves of the countries of the region and the world to try to end the threat of nuclear war
by imposing a nuclear weapon free zone in the region. I should mention it's not only the middle east
take Africa. Africa has a nuclear weapons free zone.
it cannot be implemented. why? because of the Britain and the US.
which prevent its implementation. Again not very far from Iran the Island of Diego Garcia is part of Africa.
UN has determined that, International Court of Justice has determined it
The US refuses. Britain follows orders from the US so, Britain holds on to it.
expel the population so the US can construct a major military base there
which was upgraded by Obama to
a nuclear base and it's the base
that is used all the time for bombing
central Asia and the middle east.
we can implement the African-middle east nuclear weapons free zone. What about the pacific?
Pacific has a nuclear weapons free zone. Can't be implemented cause the US insists on maintaining nuclear weapons facilities
on its Pacific Island dependencies.
This is happening all over the world.
The middle east nuclear weapons free
zone in many ways is the most important.
well all of these are areas where world opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of eliminating the threat of nuclear destruction
by means that are very
feasible. it's blocked by the US, by
Israel, by Britain which is now
actually a satellite to the US
and thanks to Putin's war driving Europe into the hands of the US
a very unstable situation. China is exploiting its own way by
economic and diplomatic moves. US is trying to use its comparative advantage, as violence do. bring about it.
to maintain the uni-polar US hegemony of the post-WWII.
Iran has to find its place within this complex. That's the worlds situation that's developing.
Another question is that right now the established order in Iran
is so integrated with the religious classes of the society which are also very powerful
for moving toward a more democratic and humanistic society
we should think of a
cultural change affecting those groups.
What do you think about
Islam in Iran and the need for this change?
And how should we move towards that?
two points: first of all it can't be brought about by force. It's gonna be brought about by the villainous of the deeply religious
harsh rulers of the Islamic population to join in a more growing developing society.
and that can happen. Second point it's not specific to Iran. It's all over the world. Take a look at Israel
Israel is now, the religious nationalist elements in the Israel, have now taken over the government.
It's not Iran but It's moving
in that direction. There's a huge protest in Israel.
a secular protest. It's pretty serious.
It's got to the point where the
Israeli air force- their major weapon of domination-
 is being threatened
because officers are refusing to serve.
There's a revolt of officers in the air force refusing their positions.
for a very simple reason. If Israel becomes a theocratic state without a at least facile of democratic secular functioning
Israeli military becomes subject to international sanctions
If Israel bombs or carries out military actions which destroy Palestinian homes, bomb people in Syria and so on,
They will be brought to the international criminal court. The facile that prevents this is we have a domestic judicial system.
eliminate that, you're in trouble. That's Israel. It's moving under the control of ultra religious segments that which
don't even care of the countries destroyed because they have god on their side literally.
Take a look at the US the Republican party, which already has substantial power and may take more power,
Its popular base is an extremist evangelical christian nationalist movement which doesn't believe in evolution
doesn't believe in global warming. It's something back in the middle ages. That's the US.
Take a look at Brazil. You saw what happened after Lula's inauguration
major attack on government on the
supreme court on the parliament
and the government facilities by organized
mobs, supported by the military
It's almost half the country. A large part of it.
 An overwhelming part is evangelical Christians.
Extremist evangelical Christians.
These are developments that are taking place all over the world not just Iran
and they have to be dealt with internally by
programs which will bring these populations
into willing acceptance of moving into a more modern developing
advanced society with rights and freedom.
It's not a small task. All of this has been exacerbated by the neoliberal programs of the past 40 years.
which have been a major assault
on the social order
 in all of the developed societies. The most
extreme is the US but others as well.
These are not trivial problems. Iran is facing them so are others,
and it should be in solidarity
with the secular democratic forces in Iran
that are calling for
women's rights and human rights.
or the same ones that are trying
to do the same under even harsher conditions in Saudi Arabia
and the same ones in the US and in western Europe
are trying to reverse the move towards more autocratic systems with
high concentration of wealth and
precarious existence for everyone else.
we're all working together. These are the elements of
the global order that have to work together in solidarity
to overcome the enormous crises that humanity faces in many dimensions. We have talked about many of them
They can all be solved. we know
ways to solve them. It's not out of control
but it has to be done and it's gonna
be steer-headed by popular forces
working in solidarity together internationally to overcome the global forces of oppression, violence and terror
The geopolitical solution you just gave about Iran
which was a kind of reconciliation between Iran and other countries and making a nuclear weapons free zone
is very trivial and easy, as you mentioned
but this problem seems so complicated and paradoxical inside Iran.
because right now the problem of enrichment
is now at the core of foreign policy in Iran
and has not been solved for four decades
How can we solve these problems while the government refuses to solve its problem with the world?
How is it an easy solution to a complicated and insoluble problem?
How can we go through these issues?
I think we know the answer. The
question is how to reach the answer.
The answer is establishing a
nuclear free zone in the middle east.
Now the Iranian government in the past has indicated support for that. Iran take the international treaty for the
prevention of the production of nuclear weapons over hundred and twenty countries
signed the treaty. It's now an [...] treaty on to the United Nations.
which bans the production
of nuclear weapons.
The nuclear weapons
stage refused to join.
but they can be pressed in that direction. What about Iran? Iran didn't actually join but it indicated support for it
and now should move forward. Governments aren't doing it so on but the population should push
Iran to move towards joining the international UN treaty for the prevention of the production of nuclear weapons.
population of Iran should be pressing
the government to be moving towards
more active advocacy of the nuclear
weapons free zone in the middle east
which the entire world supports. Arab states, global south, 277, Europe
barred by the United States
and Israel. It's a weak rid. push for that
not for enrichment of uranium
which is just a gift to the enemy.
It's a gift to US and Israel gives
them the pretext they want to use
what's their own comparative advantage:
violence. that's their advantage.
Their arena is violence. You wanna move to that direction? Suicidal of course.
You can't. If you're sensible you move to the direction where you're strong.
Popular support for a peaceful developing
world. we know the means of development.
joining the treaty for the prevention
of the production of nuclear weapons
which advocates strongly for a middle east nuclear weapons free zone. make it clear that what's blocking it
is Israeli nuclear weapons and US support for them
even in the US people would have supported that if they were aware of it. That's why it's kept quiet.
why you won't find a single article
about it in the press? of course they know about it
but they won't write about it. It's too dangerous
opens the doors to the public becoming involved
in ways which are undermined by the power.
problems would show up in every country in one way or another. well in Iran you look for those weaknesses.
Those are the ones you try to press try to develop.
And they are there. The accommodation with
Saudi Arabia opens some doors. the move towards middle east nuclear free zone opens some doors.
The pressure on the part of most of the world to draw away from the NATO-based system of global confrontation
that opens doors. Pursue them. Popular movements around the world

available to them: non-violence, popular mobilization, education
cultural activities, concrete substantive programs that meet people's immediate needs

Thank you very much for answering our
questions. After all these points I want to
ask you if you're an optimist or pessimist
about the future of the world and Iran.
And also we're hearing you if you have any final points.
well with regard in optimism and pessimism it's a very simple response
We can either choose to be pessimistic, give up hope,
hope in sure that the worst will happen. That's one choice
The other choice is to grasp the opportunities that exist
and they do exist and to pursue them as far as possible
maybe we'll make a much better world. That's not much of a choice.
Thank you very much. Thank you for accepting our invitation and answering our questions.
It's my pleasure to be with you.
Thanks. Have a good day. Goodbye
