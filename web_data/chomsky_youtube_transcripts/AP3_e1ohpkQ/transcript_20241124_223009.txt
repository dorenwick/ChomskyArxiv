we need a new system we need a new
Society we need to demand that which may
have sounded impossible even a few weeks
ago but it's not only realizable but an
imperative necessity
[Music]
21 years ago the United States suffered
the September 11 2001 attacks
shortly thereafter U.S foreign and
military policy was reoriented
the U.S went to war in Afghanistan in
Iraq in Libya fought proxy wars
elsewhere
welcome to this week's episode of the
Socialist program I'm your host Brian
Becker
today we're talking with Vijay prashad
Vijay is the executive director of The
tri-continental Institute for social
research he's the chief editor of
leftward books he's a prolific author
and he just published a new book with
Noam Chomsky called the withdrawal
Iraq Libya Afghanistan and the fragility
of U.S power that's what we'll discuss
today Vijay prashad welcome back to the
Socialist program
thanks a lot Brian it's great to be with
you
well I got a chance in preparation for
this interview to read the book The
withdrawal uh and I was excited about
the book I found it to be educational
informative even for those of us who
think we know those stories we know the
stories of endless U.S Wars not just
Iraq and not just Afghanistan and Libya
but going back to Vietnam and Laos and
Cambodia
when you read this book you'll if you if
you once knew most of this material
you'll be refreshed if you haven't read
this material I consider this a must
read
and the fact that it's based on a
conversation or a series of
conversations between you and the very
famous linguist Professor from MIT
social commentary commentator historian
Noam Chomsky makes it an even more
delightful read and Noam Chomsky has
such vast knowledge has paid careful
attention to the minutia not just the
the foreign policy of the United States
in big strokes but the minutia of U.S
foreign policy and your own scholarship
your own journalism I mean this
combination of individuals coming
together to have conversations on these
big topics I think it was just it's just
a remarkable contribution to
contemporary Progressive literature uh
before we start with the content itself
the withdrawal just talk if you would
about your own relationship with Noam
Chomsky and how this project came to be
first Brian you know everything you've
said has really touched me a lot and I'm
very grateful to you for saying all that
um when I was a young journalist in
India I was writing just around the time
of the fall of the Soviet Union is
writing about changing labor patterns in
a
um a press cast neighborhood in Delhi
and for some reason I wrote a letter to
Norm Chomsky I typed it out and I put it
in an envelope and I mailed it to his
office at MIT
um I don't know why I felt the need to
tell him about what I had found but I
did it and it went to him and I was
extremely surprised to receive a typed
letter back from him where he engaged
with what I was saying and he offered
some suggestions and he made some
connections and so on since then since
roughly 1993
um we've corresponded increasingly about
a range of issues about four or five
years later I was interested in
traveling to the Middle East to write
about the wars there in turkey and so on
again Chomsky wrote to me and I'll never
forget that he in each each time he
expressed concern for my well-being
you're going to go to the Kurdish areas
of turkey be careful these are the
things that can happen I found him to be
an extraordinarily
um kind and generous man during the time
of the pandemic it became clear to me
that the United States was going to have
to leave Afghanistan it was just clear
not just to me but U.S intelligence
reports were making it clear that
three-quarters of Afghanistan was really
not in the control of the U.S back
government in Kabul the government of
President ashrafgani so I called Nome at
this time he was under severe lockdown
in Arizona and I said to him look let's
try to put together a book for young
people mainly who didn't grow up in the
shadow of these wars to explain to them
in as plain away as possible about how
the United States got into these wars
what these wars mean and how the US was
forced to extricate from these wars at
the same time I was quite eager because
I know gnome and I shared an opinion on
this that we put out this some kind of
record Brian we don't really believe in
the view that the United States is
eternally going to be the most powerful
country that's one view a lot of sort of
Atlantic Council people Council of
Foreign Relations people write books
like that a new American Century and so
on and there was a second view which I
also disagree with which is the kind of
declinest end of the United States the
fall of the US that school of thought
which I think is sometimes
um it's just too eager to see the end of
the US Empire but doesn't get Guided by
the facts I I feel that we are somewhere
in the middle and I know Chomsky and I
agreed about this so I thought let's
assess the range of these wars but also
put a finger in the middle of this
debate and you know then we came up with
the idea that American power U.S power
is fragile it is neither Eternal nor has
it declined but it is in a position of
great fragility some areas it remains
extraordinarily a powerful in terms of
information and and Communications you
know the ideological battles in terms of
military power remains so we wanted to
have a sort of easy book to read for
young people in particular tell them
about the contemporary history but also
enter this debate you know not in a very
academic way but in a Marginal Way
yeah indeed and and I think that's one
of the great contributions and one of
the things I want to really for those
listening or watching our show to uh to
understand about this book if you don't
feel that you are a historian if you are
you know born in the last 20 years if
you didn't experience Vietnam or Laos or
if you were too young actually to
remember September 11th this book brings
you right into all of those primary
conversations with very very
knowledgeable people but it's so
accessible
and it seems to me that that's the whole
idea we're in you know uh Vijay you and
I were recently at a meeting in Brazil
hosted by the MST the The landless
Peasants movement the rural workers
movement in Brazil and there was a lot
of talk at that meeting about the Battle
of ideas meaning that if you're gonna
change the system or if you believe that
people make history and that the people
will change the system the people have
several obstacles one is the repressive
power of the State uh the military
etc etc that we're kind of aware of
that's very dramatic but there's a less
dramatic but perhaps more potent uh
obstacle that revolutionary or radical
change is up against and that is that
the dominant ideas of society are the
ideas of its ruling classes Karl Marx
said so we who believe in change
fighting for change care about change
and that's why we do this show we're not
doing this show because it's interesting
even though we hope it is we want to
make change and so the Battle of ideas
is first and foremost and and that's
what makes this book really really
important I wish every High School sort
of junior year social studies uh class
or history class could be reading this
book a matter of fact I'd like to do a
campaign demanding that because if young
people and I see by the way the
curriculum of a 15 year old 16 year old
and it's pretty awful about Vietnam lost
this is not ancient history but it's
pretty awful anyway go ahead
well look you know I mean I I agree with
you of course and I like the idea of the
campaign but I was speaking to a
reporter European reporter today before
we we spoke and he said something
interesting to me we were talking about
this book and he said to me do you feel
comfortable that in this new multipolar
world two of the major countries that
will help shape this world are
dictatorships
um he of course meant Russia and China
and I asked him a question you know
firstly it's interesting that he would
so cavalierly say that you know that
these are dictatorships well
um that's interesting
um what does he mean by that it is a
settled opinion that he is giving me
um you know where I'm supposed to in
some sort of liberal conversation say
yes I am very worried about that but I
tried to take him in a different
direction and here goes the battle of
ideas Brian in a direct way I tried to
take him in a different direction I said
look frankly
um China and Russia as well are major
powers in the world that's not something
that you or I get to choose you know
they are already by the dint of a
historical process we don't get to
select who is a major power that's a
that's part of the historical process
now
the issue is how you're going to deal
with it let's not have a debate about
whether it's dictatorship or not a
dictatorship you know uh if you believe
I asked him that let's say China is a
dictatorship and China is already
established as a major power then that
leads you given that you've asked me
this question it leads you to want to
change the government in China that kind
of question that he asked me is in fact
regime change thinking because he's
asked me are you comfortable with this
country which is a dictatorship being a
major leader well if I say I'm not
comfortable with it then the only choice
is regime change in China because the
fact is China is a major power in the
world and so I raise this with him and
it was very interesting Brian he he was
a little stupefied I I feel I don't
think he understood that he was
essentially articulating a regime change
question he thought he was just asking
an ordinary liberal question he raises
an interesting point for people Like Us
in other words what is the interesting
point that a what looks like a perfectly
reasonable liberal question perfectly
harmless liberal question is actually an
extraordinarily dangerous regime change
question because what he's effectively
saying is that we need to change the
regime in China which is a powerful
country rather than the other way around
which is the point that I would argue
for is that regardless of what your
views are on the internal political
relations in China it is image of power
it is a major power that accepts the
importance uh this in fact not just the
importance but the the essential nature
of the UN
um Charter and therefore why not
strengthen the UN system rather than
worry about the internal relations of
China that's how I would like to argue
the case very interesting that if you
you think about the Battle of ideas that
ordinary liberal arguments that Prevail
in Western Europe in the United States
and Canada and so on actually have
within them uh basically a kind of
regime changes ideology which is what to
some extent extent explains
um the is you know the kind of of a
large consensus that prevails across the
Atlantic about carrying out these sort
of Messianic Wars whether it was the war
against Iraq in the 90s or the war
against Afghanistan or the war in Libya
these were Messianic Wars in many ways
where a kind of liberal messianism
prevailed trying to shape the world in
the image of a fantasy
um you know that was held say in the
Beltway or in Cambridge University and
so on but you see what appears as an
ordinary harmless liberal statement ends
up destroying countries ends up bringing
the world to catastrophe then I think
just raising these questions Brian was
it was so interesting to see the the
journalists be a little stupefied a
little perplexed that he had entered
into an arena thinking he was just
asking a decent liberal question when in
fact essentially he was closer to Donald
Rumsfeld and people like that Dick
Cheney then he is closer to you know
people like us who are basically
peacemongers well speaking of Donald
Rumsfeld and one of the early parts of
the book your book with Noam Chomsky
you talk about how Donald Rumsfeld
reacted to September 11th
and there was a note taker or a person
in an internal meeting with Donald
Rumsfeld that afternoon the afternoon of
September 11th they were in the Pentagon
of course the Pentagon was also struck I
was here in New York City actually not
too far from the World Trade Center
uh so New Yorkers were thinking World
Trade Center that dominated Manhattan
but there was the other attack which was
on the Pentagon so you would think well
they must be tending to the wounded and
worried about another attack but in that
few hours afterwards Donald Rumsfeld
sits with some staff
and his thoughts are not about imminent
new attacks on the building
his thoughts are how can we use this
this is a unique and wonderful
opportunity that's what he's basically
suggesting in the notetaker you include
the notes in this important chapter he's
like now we have it we have a rare
opportunity and that was for regime
change and when you look at the
countries that are then targeted then
demonized labeled as either a
dictatorship or harboring terrorists or
having Weapons of Mass uh destruction
whatever they are but they're all
dictatorships of course as you said and
there was an assumption because the
demonization is so complete that even
liberals who would presumably be
anti-war sort of assumed the basic
assumption about in the demonization
campaign but it was all premised as
Rumsfeld clearly stated in the hours
after September 11th on a new foreign
policy and the governments that are
targeted are not Saudi Arabia they're
not dictatorships in Latin America
they're not the state of Israel in spite
of its occupation policies these are
governments that are in resource-rich
parts of the world that have their
origin whether you like the governments
or not they have their origins in the
anti-colonial project of the post-world
War II and yet even though Rumsfeld and
this is what makes this so important for
the book He's sort of telling the truth
about what's coming but liberals and I
don't mean to just castigate liberals I
people in society who's whose opinions
are being shaped by the ruling class in
society
adopt all of the assumptions of the
demonizers not realizing as you said
because they have an innocence about
them or a seeming innocence not
realizing that their formulations their
narrative is actually part of a larger
uh sort of public relations campaign by
people who intend to go to war
you know it's it's really interesting
Brian and this is something I've learned
from Chomsky over the years if you pay
attention to U.S documents and to the
things that U.S High officials say you
learn a lot you don't really need a
whistleblower
um you know if you look at the strategy
statements the the documents of the
state department you don't even need to
look at the CIA actually just look at
the state department dog you learn a lot
about U.S policy and in fact that little
sheet of paper where the statement was
written was later revealed through
Freedom of Information and so on some of
it was leaked some of the documents of
the time were leaked and so on you got a
really good picture about what was going
on and by the way Stephen Cole's book
about the lead up to the Afghanistan war
is is an extraordinary book written by a
mainstream journalist who also
interviews a higher officials of the U.S
military and state department and just
gets a lot chomsky's greatest Brilliance
is that he has closely passed through
the writings and speeches of the U.S
government itself to read between the
lines to put together their own strategy
this is from 1967 onwards you know it's
incredible his reading of the Pentagon
papers published as the backroom boys is
unparalleled so when you look closely at
what the high officials of the
government in the U.S were saying from
1990 many of the same characters that
are in the Bush Administration Dick
Cheney and so on their plans and
thoughts for the post-soviet world are
extraordinary because they keep trying
to put those plans into effect
um to make sure for instance that the
United States Remains the principal
power in the world to get rid of a
series of countries that they believe
are holding back the possibilities of
U.S power for instance over throw the
revolution
um you know in in Cuba that's always
been on the agenda but then if you go to
the Middle East get rid of the Islamic
Republic get rid of the government in
Syria get rid of the Iraqi government
and so on a list of governments they
want to overthrow all of that is put on
the table
um you know it's not it's totally
transparent it's written in the sheets
of paper that they write and then they
publish as security statements and so on
terms like in a period before 9 11 terms
like Rogue State uh invented as part of
this exercise of delegitimizing entire
parts of the world if a country is a
rogue State then you don't really have
to treat it with any kind of dignity
diplomatic dignity and you don't have to
worry about having a real
um you know a causes belly or cause of
War you can go to war because it's a
rogue State you don't really need to
have a um you know pretext for war the
pretext is already there in the nature
of the state itself North Korea for
instance a rogue state it already always
already can be overthrown you don't
really need a pretext it's not necessary
it helps it helps to convince the United
Nations perhaps liberals who are not
quite bought into the project and so on
but even the way you term the state as a
rogue State as an axis of Evil and so on
this act of delegitimizing entire parts
of the world incredible what it allows
Brian and this is a key part of the book
is it allows the United States both to
ignore uh and treaties of peace from
Iraq Afghanistan Libya countries which
said look we want to cut a deal we don't
want a war you can ignore that as the
United States does and we show that
Saddam Hussein in 1990 just weeks after
the invasion in Kuwait comes and says I
want a deal with you the Afghans want to
deal the libyans want to deal not only
does the U.S refuse the deal but in
there's a kind of fog of Amnesia that
sets in and people just don't remember
that Saddam in 1990 asked for two deals
very interesting Brian we highlight this
and there's a reason we highlight it
because I think this is forgotten by
even people who as you said have kept up
with the histories of these wars so
utterly forgotten that Saddam twice
asked for a peace deal in 1990 it's
entirely forgotten that the New York
Times and Washington Post refused to
report on the Iraqi
um you know attempt to get a peace deal
and the only reason we know about it is
that that deal was somehow leaked to a
reporter from Newsday a paper in Long
Island which published these stories if
news they hadn't published it because
the Iraqis did such a bad job of
represent ending themselves you know why
didn't they go to say Lamont or even
um you know leftist papers Lou manite in
France and tried to no they didn't
bother they just tried in New York
failed their Ambassador failed they put
it aside somebody leaked it to Newsday
that's how we found out about it so this
attitude that there are some Rogue
States or there is an axis of Evil
allows you to say we don't need to
negotiate with them they are barbarians
and if they do put forward some kind of
negotiating agreement on the table we
can completely forget about it the
record will forget about it nobody is
going to write about after this
conversation with Norm I went back and
looked at some of the standard texts on
the lead up to the wars in Iraq the two
was lead up to the war in Afghanistan I
saw no mention in any of these texts of
the peace and treaty that came from
Baghdad and from Kabul completely
obliterated in the historical record
indeed and and even after September 11th
and after the U.S invasion of
Afghanistan which started October 7th uh
2001 the the Taliban were dispersed the
Taliban were basically defeated
they were fleeing they were retreating
wildly and there was a back room uh
offer to the U.S by the Taliban
basically to surrender
in exchange for in exchange for amnesty
basically that they wouldn't be
imprisoned or killed to which that same
Donald Rumsfeld said we don't negotiate
with terrorists just keep that in mind
everybody because here we are 20 years
later the Taliban is the government
the U.S said no we won't negotiate even
your own surrender we won't even
negotiate an unconditional surrender
we're not going to talk to you because
we don't have to we're that bad we're
that big we're that strong and you are
that weak
and here we are 20 years later 241
000 Afghans are dead from the 20-year
occupation by NATO North Atlantic Treaty
Organization that's Afghanistan not part
of the North Atlantic
uh seven you know only about 2 000
Americans or a few thousand more
contractors died but thirty thousand U.S
service members who served in Iraq or
Afghanistan committed suicide the number
of people who killed themselves as a the
casualty rates about four times higher
the U.S spent several trillion dollars
on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
and now under the pretext of helping
girls defending the rights of girls to
go to school the U.S has seized control
of the same assets that belong to
Afghanistan nine billion dollars and so
now the US is essentially starving
Afghan girls and when I say starving I'm
not saying it hyperbolically girls are
starving like their brothers are
starving in Afghanistan
and there's and the the US always uses a
pretext so you have pretextual
explanations that pacify the public at
home
you have this brute power that allows
the policy makers to make big decisions
which are frequently very bad decisions
I mean even bad for the empire
but the thing goes on and on and on it
doesn't that's why I'm so glad you used
the idea or the word the language of
fragility the Empire and decline doesn't
mean the Empire will go away in fact no
capitalist system ends its own rule the
ruling class doesn't say gee we really
mess things up we're going to step back
now they have to be changed they they
have to be gotten rid of a new system
has to be created by people so they're
not going to disappear but there's a
fragile nature of the power but it's a
it's a it's a toxic fragility it's a
kind of fragility that unless we the
people restrain it it keeps using all of
these pretexts to carry out hideous
acts and crimes against humanity which
are right at the top tier of crimes
against humanity these are not like the
the Nazi crimes were here and American
work crimes against humanity are down
here I mean when you think about Vietnam
which you talked about with gnome and he
was a leading analyst there maybe 4 4
million Vietnamese died and I think you
talk about in the book about how
casualties are dealt with there's a sort
of a disinterest in how many people died
in Vietnam we care about how many
Americans died but we don't care about
the Vietnamese or the Iraqis or the
Afghans we don't seem to care when I say
we I mean I'm talking about Bourgeois
society and its opinion mulders
you know this is something that is is
very meaningful to Chomsky and he keeps
talking about how there is a kind of
mismatch between the facts of the
numbers of people that died in some of
these U.S Wars and the way it is those
those data Remembered in the United
States so there have been a series of
polls small scale polls one at the
University of Massachusetts where
students were asked how many people do
you think died in Vietnam and the
Vietnamese numbers are enormously
deflated
um you know and you ask them about other
Wars say U.S casualties in in World War
II the numbers are enormously inflated
there's a sense that a lot of U.S troops
died in World War II but that very few
Vietnamese died in Vietnam almost no
knowledge about the fact that the war
never really ended in 1975 in Vietnam
because once you destroy with chemical
weapons uh precious agricultural land
the war effective only continues for
Generations because that land is no
longer going to be you know you can't
grow food crops at least there let alone
anything you know on a scene down the
what used to be called the Ho Chi Minh
trail large areas of land which are just
you know fenced over and closed for you
know maybe 100 years more I don't know
uh you know it's still heavily polluted
by the agent orange dropped on those
parts of the world there is a mismatch
in public Consciousness there is a
feeling that well once the United States
withdraws from Afghanistan the war is
over but as you said
um Afghan money was held in in New York
banks by an Afghan government that was
pliant to the United States that's why
they held the money in the U.S banks and
after the Taliban came to power that
nine billion dollars was was divided
into two United States decided that half
of that money the money of the Afghan
people who were not responsible for 9 11
half of that money was going to pay the
survivors and the victims of 9 11. the
family members and so on the other half
was going to be held by the United
States government who will decide where
that money should go you're quite right
90 percent of the people of Afghanistan
according to U.N numbers are suffering
from extreme poverty starvation of
course a great symptom of that extreme
poverty
um but it gets worse than that in a way
there is an assumption that until the
Taliban came into Power things were okay
in Afghanistan you know Brian I went and
interviewed people in the education
Ministry in Kabul before the U.S
government collapsed I asked them simple
question you know all the data keeps
coming in from the education Ministry of
how they have improved education in all
the provinces in Afghanistan and I asked
them how is that possible because U.S
military says that effectively the
Afghan National Army the government of
Kabul and the U.S troops only hold four
or five principal districts so how is
how is the education Ministry able to
function in other parts of the country
and the what I heard from them was
remarkable Brian and I'm surprised this
was not the front page of the New York
Times what they said was they calculate
numbers of students not based of the
actual head counts of the students but
of the number of chairs that the schools
have that based on how many chairs are
imported into Afghanistan often through
contracts given by the U.S government
often contracts held by U.S contractors
the number of chairs defined the number
of students in a classroom you can
already see this is absurd particularly
when I discovered from other people that
a lot of these chairs were sitting in
warehouses next to Kabul Airport they
hadn't even been sent to the districts
so there's a false understanding that
before that Taliban took over there was
a lot of girls education and all of this
has collapsed as a consequence of the
Taliban Takeover in fact there wasn't
great education taking place during
um the high point of the U.S occupation
it was just not possible to do it why
not face up to that I mean a country has
to fight its own battles of Social
Development you can't come in there with
guns and tell people you have to do this
at least not in this way and this is a
good reminder of why the U.S got
involved in Afghanistan in the first
place not in 2001 but in the 1970s after
the Communists took over in Afghanistan
in 1978 one of the first things they did
was to send out some of their best card
University students from Kabul from
Kandahar from jalalabad and even mazara
Sharif these students were sent out into
the countryside in a massive literacy
campaign and you know the first
indication of the
the U.S backed forces in Afghanistan
against the government in Kabul the
communist government at the time the
first indication was the assassinations
of these teachers in different districts
look how the world moves you know these
people in the 70s tried to improve
literacy against the resistance of the
landowners they were thwarted then
eventually when the U.S government comes
back they buy chairs and the chairs
stand in for students and now you don't
even have these chairs
indeed indeed very very important
information thousands of those teachers
were assassinated at that time thousands
and the Communist uh government that
took power in 1978 in Afghanistan when
you look at its political program it was
education for girls minimum wage Land
Reform the right to unionize in essence
really what would be called in Marxist
language a Bourgeois democratic program
minimum program to help Afghanistan
develop
and at that time the mujahideen
so-called and it became an international
movement in Osama Bin Laden who later
forms Al-Qaeda was a principal
fundraiser and spokesperson and that at
that time at that time the United States
was on the side of Osama bin Laden on
the side of the mujahdin people have to
really know this that at that time the
United States was supporting the forces
who developed or devolved or evolved
into Al Qaeda and eventually the Taliban
but because they were fighting
socialists they were the good extremist
elements because they were fighting
socialism it was fine that they were
going to kill teachers who dared to try
to teach girls to read in the
countryside and one of the interesting
parts of the book uh and the
conversation that you're having with
Noam Chomsky
is uh how that period in the late 1970s
and early and mid 1980s is remembered by
Afghans who actually care about the
rights of women and the rights of girls
and the rights of Education
and Nam Chomsky was no you know sort of
uh Camp follower of the Soviet Union far
from it uh he wouldn't describe himself
as pro-soviet I don't think at any time
but in his objectivity which is revealed
in your book in your conversations with
him Noam Chomsky is talking about how
the people who actually know what's
going on in Kabul say in the early 1980s
and comparing it to now or to later
think of that period the period of the
so-called Soviet occupation as a golden
era that's all in this book
well it's really interesting that on
several occasions of our conversation
gnome came to the point that during the
U.S occupation
um a distinguished high official of the
British government wrote in the
financial times that when he went into
the bazaars in Kabul in Kabul which was
the heart of the U.S occupation there
were posters with a picture of Muhammad
najibullah now who was Muhammad
najibullah Muhammad najibullah was the
last communist president of Afghanistan
who was brutally killed by the Taliban
they dragged him out of the UN office in
Kabul hung him to a Lamppost let his
body sit there and so on by the way it's
with great pleasure that one of the
blurbs at the back of the book is
written by Muhammad najibullah's
daughter hila najibullah
um a very good political scientist
herself who you know continues to sort
of hold up the importance of a father's
role in the declining years of the
people's Democratic
um you know government in in Afghanistan
but you see you're right I mean Norm
Chomsky is definitely never said I'm a
camp follower as you put it of the
Soviet Union but he's driven by the
facts and what do the facts show him
well until he met rasil Basu a very
important U.N official
um you know a woman who had been
stationed in Baghdad during the
declining years of
um of the the communist government and
then during the period of the the
mujahideen rasil Basu had seen all this
with her own eyes and she reported to
Chomsky that this is what I saw but
what's striking and we mentioned this in
the book is that in the lead up to the
invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 No
period article in the United States
neither the major newspapers in New York
Times but not even Ms magazine the
leading American feminist periodical
would carry an article written by rasil
Basu about what she had her
self-experienced as a high official of
the United Nations in Afghanistan about
girls education during the communist
government by the way eventually she did
publish that article but not in the
United States it was published in Asia
times which is based in Bangkok read
widely in Asia but not read that much in
the United States
um Chomsky is a person who basically
follows the facts and when you look at
the facts here you look at the fact that
somebody like rasil Basu is saying look
there's this issue of girls education
during the Communist rule but then more
than anything else when a conservative
British official says that one of the
most highly respected figures in Kabul
uh is Muhammad najib Allah it should
give one pause a najibullah much more
um you know much more beloved than Hamid
Karzai somebody who is supposed to have
helped liberate Afghanistan from the
Taliban now a country like Afghanistan
doesn't deserve the Taliban I don't
agree with that opinion you know that
this is some sort of medieval country
and that's where the people are at it
just happens that the Taliban right now
the principal political force in the
country other political forces will
arise the contradictions of Afghanistan
will generate its own internal political
oppositions as it is already
producing there are protests taking
place around the country let's see how
it develops but I very much caution
people from the belief that only a NATO
intervention or only a U.S intervention
only the United States squeezing
Afghanistan is going to get rid of the
Taliban we've been through that before
over and over again can't countries have
to develop their own resistance against
the kind of you know ghastly political
forces that exist there they don't
really need
um you know planes to come and bomb
their adversaries what they need is
solidarity that's different solidarity
is an acceptable form of
internationalism but bombing War that's
not internationalism that's precisely
it's opposite
I was just recently on um a television
panel about the 20th anniversary or 21st
anniversary of the U.S invasion of
Afghanistan and it was really an
interesting panel it was people from
South Asia people from China myself from
the United States but what I found most
interesting about it was
a short video that was made by someone
who was on the panel who had been a U.S
diplomat
and uh in in Afghanistan and he went
around and he was interviewing people
one year after the U.S withdrawal from
Afghanistan and he said what everybody
talked about everybody talked about was
now there was security like there was
peace like there was there was this very
positive outcome a year later that
people weren't hearing drones in the
skies they weren't thinking there was
about to be a battle I mean the idea of
just living in peace for those of us who
live say in the United States who you
know our country hasn't been directly
immersed in a war since you know the
Civil War on our own soil you you kind
of don't know what that's about you
don't you know it's all a bit of an
abstraction but people were really happy
including people who he was talking to
who were enemies of the Taliban they
were just happy that bombs were not
falling after 20 years of war after so
many dead but they were also talking
about and he interviewed a number of
low-income folks who were surviving five
years ago they can't survive
they literally can't survive there was
and this reminded me so much of what
happened in Iraq because I went to Iraq
a lot I went right before the first Gulf
War I took Muhammad Ali in an Entourage
of his friends we tried to stop the war
we organized demonstrations and later I
went to Iraq and was bringing medicine
as part of an international Civil
Disobedience against the economic
sanctions which are just a form of slow
motion genocide against poor people and
it reminded me so much because we went
from emergency room to emergency room in
Baghdad hospitals talking to Moms while
their little shriveled babies were
literally dying as we spoke to them
because they didn't have medicine for
treatable problems like like diarrhea
that they got from Bad drinking water
that's what's happening now in
Afghanistan so all the people who talk
about we believe we we have to punish
the Taliban because we care about girls
and girls rights and of course we should
and we should fight against the
reactionary policies of the Taliban but
strangulating the economy economically
that's another part of this book that I
think is so important is that it's not
only a critique of U.S foreign policy
but sort of the humanism of of Chomsky
his concern about those who are the
targets the victims of American
imperialism that comes through and I
think this is an important part of the
battle of ideas an important part of
movement building in the United States
is to not treat this as some sort of
abstraction you can say oh they're
Afghans they're not us but they are us I
mean we're all part of the same Human
family and that's one of the elements of
chomsky's sort of cutting analysis that
I think also is so important for the
movement to share
you know um what you say is very true
because
um it's very painful to hear people
basically bring us back to the era of
when Collective punishment was
acceptable Brian which is now illegal uh
thanks to the Geneva conventions it's
illegal to actually impose Collective
punishment against the population we are
hearing now from elected officials in
the UK in the U.S about how sanctions
against Russia must hurt the Russian
people those statements themselves are
illegal according to the Geneva
Convention the sanctions against Iran
must hurt the Iranian people that's an
illegal statement to make because the
Geneva conventions prevents Collective
punishment
um it seems that people are just inured
to the fact that the Afghans must have
Collective punishment against them this
theft of this nine billion dollars is
effectively a form of collective
punishment against the Afghan people and
it's outrageous it should not be allowed
look that Taliban have twice benefited
from the argument that at least we have
security once in 96 don't forget that
the war between the mujahideen and the
Soviets which I had been backed fully by
the U.S the Saudis the pakistanis and so
on that war was not as bloody as the
Civil War amongst the mujahideen from
about 1992 to 1996. that was Far
bloodier
leading one faction of the jamati islami
essentially fired Rockets directly into
Kabul you know devastating civilian
neighborhoods the Taliban came to power
in 96 yes they were brutal they murdered
najibullah in Cold Blood but having
taken power people said well thank God
the Civil War is over so they have twice
benefited from this you know now people
say thank God this is over but you're
quite right the contradictions in
Afghanistan are going to generate a
politics I mean the the Afghan people
are up to it you know up to the task of
generating their own resistance in their
own small different ways you know
there's already women on the streets
calling for women's education we've
already seen old trade unionists people
that I've known for years uh going on to
the streets talking about the cost of
living and so on they're going to
generate their own critique and by the
way what you said about Chomsky I want
to point out something he mentioned to
me
during the point the high point of the
U.S war on Vietnam the United States
actually bombed the university in Hanoi
so most of the buildings had been
destroyed and the faculty members in
Vietnam at least in the northern part
felt completely cut off from all the
educational Trends around the world they
didn't know what was being published in
their various Fields now one of the
amazing things about a person like Norm
Chomsky he happens to know everything
about a lot of things including you know
the latest in biology and so on he reads
widely so when he was in Hanoi in 1969
professors came up to him and sent Mr
Chomsky at the time he was a very young
man they said would you give a series of
lectures for a whole week you know
basically all through the day on a range
of subjects just like just basically
download your brain to us we want to
know what's happening in the rest of the
world it's a very interesting moment in
both the uh the struggle in Vietnam and
in chomsky's visit there so he spent the
whole week just giving public lectures
in bombed out buildings all kinds of
places what did he talk about he talked
about of course you know latest
developments in linguistics latest
writings in political science but he
also talked about Norman mailer's recent
book which he had just read and what was
going on on U.S television you know he
talked about a range of issues why
because the Vietnamese are people
because he understood that even at a
time of Great War they want they were
curious to build their knowledge their
capacity to be humans in the world that
everything about being in Vietnam wasn't
to see which was what area was bombed
and you know how are people no it was
also what what happens tomorrow because
after all the war is going to end at
some point and these professors are
going to get back to teaching at some
point they are human beings the capacity
to see your country's adversary as a
human being that is the capacity that we
need to inculcate among young people
around the world young people in the
United States in particular need to see
the Afghan people as much more than
victims of a terrible recent history
there are people who are interested in a
range of issues if a young person in the
United States wants to do say a zoom
class for people in Afghanistan in Kabul
on you know some issue or the other how
interesting to make that step to connect
even with you know middle class children
in Kabul who have access to some
computers and so on even that gesture
Brian that is a profound gesture of
humanization not only for the people in
in Afghanistan but in the United States
and if if we if you and I want to take a
group of people to Kabul and we can go
and lecture in Kabul University how
interesting let's see if the Taliban
would allow us Brian to teach a one-week
course on Marxism inside um in Kabul
University
all right Vijay as we go out I want to I
want to ask to have the the copy of the
book the cover of the book come back up
on our screen if possible because uh the
reason we're talking is not only because
you're a fascinating person and you're
traveling around the world and you're
engaged in struggle and you're launching
uh tri-continental research uh The
tri-continental Institute and involved
in so many Endeavors uh but also because
we want people to read this book this is
a good book for those who are still
wanting to learn even basic information
it's accessible it's comprehensive the
fact that it talks about Vietnam and
Laos and Cambodia the wars of 50 and 60
years ago but then updates it with the
two Iraq Wars the Libya conflict and
other conflicts Afghanistan of course uh
that makes it you know cover as a survey
sort of a recent important part of U.S
history but it also gives us a political
perspective it gives us the perspective
that it's a it's an Empire a fragile
Empire an Empire that won't die on its
own uh an Empire whose greatest weakness
its greatest vulnerability if there if
one is looking for vulnerabilities is
not in Ukraine or Afghanistan or in Iraq
but right here in the United States
where people who care people who are
also suffering are together fighting for
justice and for radical transformation
Vijay prashad thank you so much for
