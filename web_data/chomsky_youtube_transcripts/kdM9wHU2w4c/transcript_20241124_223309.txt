now last week indeed to conduct the
question/answer session there are a huge
number of questions about 50 so they've
been classified perhaps very poorly into
four broad categories in a hope that at
least the kinds of questions will be
answered the first set of questions
professor Chomsky is referred to I'll
put one of the questions and they are
several like that do you see the present
conflict between the Taliban and the US
and its allies can take take the shape
of Clash of Civilizations as expected by
mr. Huntington and then along with that
I'll just add another two sets of
questions so that you can answer them
perhaps together the concept of
religious fanaticism what do you what do
you see it as evolving further and
fundamentalism of various kinds in the
world how can that be fought and what
can stop it and is there any chance at
all for a change in the unequal conical
concentrations of power do you see any
kind of change then there are two other
categories of questions which we'll also
put forward but if this this set can
first be
if I forget remind me the first question
was does the US Taliban confrontation
have something to do with Huntington's
thesis of the clash of civilizations the
remember the context of Huntington's
thesis the context in which was put
forth now this is after the end of the
Cold War for 50 years both the United
States and the Soviet Union had used the
pretext pretext of the Cold War as a
justification for any atrocity that they
wanted to carry out so if the Russians
one of the send tanks to East Berlin
that's because of the Cold War and if
the u.s. wanted to invade South Vietnam
and wiped out into China that was
because of the Cold War if you look over
the history of this period the pre picks
had nothing to do with the reasons the
reasons for the atrocities were
domestically based in power interests
but the Cold War gave an excuse whatever
atrocity carried out I could say its
defense against the other side after the
collapse of the Soviet Union the pretext
is gone the policies remain the same
in fact the policies continued about as
before or slight changes in tactics but
you need a new pretext and in fact
there's been a search for pretext for
quite a long time actually it starts 20
years ago when the Reagan administration
who came in was already pretty clear
that appeal to the pretext of the
Russian threat was not going to work for
very long so they came into office
saying
that the focus of their foreign policy
would be to combat the plague of
international terrorism that was 20
years ago
there's nothing new about this we have
to defend ourselves from our other
terrorists and they proceeded to react
to that plague by creating the most
extraordinary international terrorist
network in the world which carried out
in massive terror in Central America
southern Africa all over the place in
fact it was so extreme they were even
condemned by the World Court and
Security Council with 1989 becoming you
needed some nutri texts so and it was
very explicit one remember one of the
tasks of intellectuals the solemn tasks
is to prevent people from understanding
what's going on and in order to fulfill
that task you have to ignore the
government documentation for example
which tells you exactly what's going on
and this is a case in point just to give
you one illustration every year the
White House presents to Congress
statement of why we need a huge military
budget and for a year every year is
always the same the Russians are coming
the Russians are coming so we need this
monstrous military budget the question
that everyone who is interested in
international affairs should have been
asking themselves is what are they going
to say in March 1990 that is the first
presentation after the Russians clearly
aren't coming they're not
anymore so that was a very important
document and it's extremely interesting
and of course it is unmentioned anywhere
because it's much too interesting that's
yeah I wrote a better but I don't know
anybody else it's a public vacuum you
know you have to work not to see what's
in it and it was quite interesting as
you'd expect March 1990 the Bush
administration first Bush administration
gave its presentation to Congress it's
exactly the same as every other year you
need a huge military budget we have to
have a massive intervention forces
mostly poised at the Middle East we have
to protect what's called the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism that
means high tech industry we have to
ensure that the public pays the costs of
high-tech industry by funneling it
through the military system under the
pretext of defense so it's exactly the
same as before
the only thing that was different was
the reasons it turned out the reasons we
needed all of this was not because the
Russians are coming
but I'm quoting because of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers that's why we need the huge
military budget the massive military
forces aimed at the Middle East still
have to be aimed there and then comes an
interesting phrase it says they have to
be aimed at the Middle East where the
threat to our interests could not be
laid at the Kremlin's door ok so sorry
I've been lying to you for 50 years but
now the Kremlin isn't around anymore so
I got to tell you the truth the threat
to our interest could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door remember it couldn't be
laid at a rat's door either because at
that time Saddam Hussein was a great
friend and ally of the United States
you've already carried out his worst
atrocities like you know gassing Kurds
thing else but he remained a fine guy
hadn't disobeyed orders yet the one
crime that mattered so nothing could be
later Dirac store couldn't be late at
the Kremlin store in fact it had to be
laid right at the door where it always
had been the fear that forces within the
region would take control of their own
destiny including their own resources
and that can't be tolerated obviously so
we have to support brutal oppressive
states like Saudi Arabia and others to
make sure that they work for that they
guarantee that the profits from oil it's
not too much the oil is the profits from
well a flow to the people who deserve it
rich Western energy corporations of the
US Treasury Department or bill
construction and so on
so that's why we need it other than that
it's the same all right what does this
have to do with Huntington well he's a
he's a respected intellectual he can't
say this you know he can't say look it's
exactly the same as always before it's a
waste the method by which the rich run
the world and the major confrontation in
the world remains what it's always been
small concentrated sectors of wealthy
power are versus versus everybody else
you can't say that and in fact if you
look at those passages on The Clash of
Civilizations he says in the future the
conflict will not be on economic grounds
so let's put that out of our minds can't
think about you know rich powers and
corporations of exploiting people that
can't be the conflict it's got to be
something else so it'll be the clash of
civilizations the Western civilization
and Islam and Confucianism and that's
the clash of civilizations well you can
test that I mean it's a strange idea but
you can test it you can test it by
asking how has the United States were
the leader of the Western civilization
how has it reacted to Islamic
fundamentalists for example well the
answer is it's been their leading
supporter so the most extreme Islamic
fundamentalist state in the world at
that time with Saudi Arabia and may be
succeeded by the Taliban but that's an
offshoot of Saudi Arabia nihilism
Saudi Arabia is a client of the United
States since its origins and the reason
is because it plays the right role it
ensures that the wealth of the region
goes to the right people you know not
people in the slums of Cairo but people
in executive suites in New York and as
long as it does that they can be it can
treat women as awfully as they want they
can be most extreme fundamentalists of
existence and they're just fine
that's the most extreme fundamentalist
state in the world what's the biggest
Muslim straightest state in the world
well Indonesia what's the relation
between the United States and Indonesia
well actually the United States was
hospital in Indonesia until 1965 that's
because Indonesia was part of the
non-aligned movement the United States
hated mirror
despised him in fact for exactly the
same reason so they despised Indonesia
it was independent furthermore as a
dangerous country because it had one
mass based political party the PKI which
was a party of the poor party of
peasants basically and it was gaining
power through the open democratic system
and therefore that hadn't stopped the
u.s. tried to stop it in 1958 by
supporting a rebellion in general
that fell we then started supporting the
Indonesian army and in 1965 the army
carried out a coup general circular
carried out a coup and they carried out
a huge massacre of hundreds of thousands
maybe a million people mostly landless
peasants wiped out the only mass space
party this led to unrestrained euphoria
in the West the United States Britain in
Australia with David who so you know
such a glorious event but they couldn't
control themselves I mean the headlines
were you know gleam of light and Asia
where there once was none you know the
Indonesian moderates have carried out a
boiling bloodbath I mean didn't conceal
what happened
staggering mass slaughter the greatest
event in history the CIA compared it to
the massacres of Stalin and Hitler and
that was wonderful and ever since that
time Indonesia was a major was a
favorite ally of the United States it
continued to have one of the bloodiest
records in the late 20th century mass
murder and his team were hideous
tortures of dissidents but it was fun it
was the biggest Islamic state in the
world that was just fine so heart though
was our kind of guy way when he
described it when he visited the mid 90s
and he stayed he stayed a friend of the
United States until he made a mistake
he made a mistake by dragging his feet
over IMF orders the after the Asian
crash the IMF imposed very harsh borders
and Suharto didn't go along the way was
supposed to and he also lost control
that's a mistake he lost control of the
society and at that point the Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright gave me a
phone call and said literally
said we think it's time for a democratic
transition merely by accident four hours
later he abdicated and put in this
strange accident and but Indonesia
remained the u.s. favorite state so
there's two of the Islamic states what
about the most extreme Islamic
fundamentalist non-state actors let's
say the al Qaeda Network who formed then
that's a creation of the CIA British
intelligence Saudi Arabia funding Egypt
and so on they brought the most extreme
radical fundamentalists they could find
anywhere in North Africa or the Middle
East and made it training them armed
them nurtured them to harass the
reference to help the Afghans the these
guys were carrying out terrorism for the
very beginning you know they
assassinated the president Sadat 20
years ago but they were this main group
supported by the United States so you
know where's the clash of civilizations
let's move a little further during the
1980s the United States carry out a
major war in Central America a couple
hundred thousand people were killed four
countries almost destroyed and I mean
that's a vast war who was the target of
that war well one of the main targets
was the Catholic Church the decade of
the 1980s began with the assassination
of an archbishop it ended with the
assassination of six leading
intellectuals Jesuit intellectuals
including the rector of the main
university they were killed by this it's
basically the same people terrorist
forces organized and armed and trained
by the United States in between that
period plenty of church people were
killed
usual hundreds of thousands of peasants
and poor people on the side but one of
the main targets was the Catholic Church
why well the Catholic Church had
committed a grievous sin in Latin
America for hundreds of years that had
been the Church of the rich that was fun
but in the 1960s the Latin American
bishops undertook what they called a
preferential option for the poor well at
that point they became like this mass
based political party in Indonesia which
was a party of the poor and the peasants
and naturally after he wiped out so the
Catholic Church had to be smashed coming
back to the beginning just where is the
clash of civilizations I mean there's a
clash or a there's a clash between those
who are adopting the preferential option
for the poor no matter what they are I
think many Catholics they can be
communists they can be anything else
they can be white black bringing
anything it's a Western terrorist
totally ecumenical it's not really
racist they'll kill anybody
who takes the wrong stand on the major
issues but if your intellectual you
can't say that because it's too
obviously true and you can't let people
understand what's obviously true you
have to create the theories you know
that only you know they understand if
you have a PhD from Harvard or something
so we have a clash of civilizations and
we're supposed to worship that but yeah
it's just makes absolutely
Miles's many how many students that you
have taught continue to follow a act of
on your teachings and in essence is
there some kind of mass hypnosis or what
kind of reaction do you get in the
United States to your to your speeches
so those two well the second is easier
so we start with that but you know I
teach graduate courses in linguistics
and philosophy semester sensitive
technology I've been involved in things
like this most of my life in resistance
you know how to jail sorts of things but
I don't let it interfere with pg
so it does not enter into my teaching if
students know about that side of my life
that's just they come to talk story that
I write or something so there's no
essentially the influence on students
say in my own Department is whatever it
is anywhere else has nothing to do with
anything that happens in a graduate
seminar the that's argue about it but my
view is that's the way it ought to be
done anyhow that's what on the others
it's you know well the way the United
States works it's a very free country
very little state repression by
comparative standards especially if
you're more or less privileged I am most
of us are
the but you can be excluded so you know
you you're excluded from the mainstream
especially the parts that are more to
the left liberal side and visit the real
connoisseurs you know they have to make
sure that you go this far and not one
millimeter further that's so they are a
lot on the other hand there's plenty of
opportunities to reach other people I
mean a few days before I came here and
gave a talk in Boston which had an
audience of about two or three thousand
people and was over the inner wall
broadcast live over the internet and all
sorts of things and that goes on all the
time and it's not just me it's other
people who spend their lives the same
way so there's consider a very large
outreach and you know that this kind of
interacts with it doesn't create popular
movements by any means in fact it
responds to them it's the popular
movements that create the opportunities
for things like this so and all these
hundreds of talks I give all over the
place are organized by somebody and
they're organized by local people who
are carrying out some kind of work which
can be with women or working people or
homeless or immigrants and other things
and they want an occasion in which if
somebody will come and give a talk for a
fundraiser bleeded take part in a
demonstration or whatever it may be and
those are the opportunities and that
reaches huge numbers of people that's
it's because of these activities that
the country has just changed radically
in the last 30 or 40 years completely
it's a totally different country it's
much more civilized than it was 40 years
ago that's why the 60s are so hated the
you know sick days are so denounced in a
leaked discussion the reason is they had
a very
natural civilizing effect on the society
in many different ways
women's rights and our mental issues
opposition to aggression
you know concern those the first time
well this is from the 60s it was the era
before but it really took off after the
sixties in the seventies and eighties
the anti-nuclear movements and so on in
fact if a striking indication of it is
that the 1960s are the first time in
u.s. history first time after hundreds
of years that some attention was paid to
the fate of the indigenous population
remember that country was built on
massive ethnic cleansing I mean you know
millions of people were exterminated or
seven or eight million people maybe more
than around anymore oh there was
exterminated and it was never an issue
never discussed you know textbooks if
they talked about it crazy I mean when I
grew up as a kid we would play cowboys
and Indians you know where we're the
Cowboys and you kill the Indians that
was just normal
the well you know the the leading
diplomatic history of the United States
by Thomas Bailey liberals during the
1969 describes he says after the
Revolutionary War was over kicked out
the British the colonists turned to thee
to their next task namely felling trees
and Indians and expanding to their
natural quarters okay so they were trees
in the way they were Indians in the way
and sort of knock them all down expanded
to the national borders that wasn't
considered an odd thing to say you know
this changed in the nineteen mean it is
so deep you know it's so deeply rooted
that some of the things that happen are
I mean like for example when you read
about Israeli helicopters being used to
assassinate the Palestinian political
leaders to questions
where'd the helicopters come from Israel
doesn't produce helicopters they were
sent by Clinton and Bush for that
purpose you know knowing that that's
what they're for furthermore what's the
name of the helicopters well there are
patches if they're not Apaches there
Comanches or Blackhawks or when you send
missiles with Afghanistan that tomahawks
in fact the weapons of war in the United
States are named after the victims of
genocide you know if in Germany these
days they name the helicopters of the
Luftwaffe and Jew and gypsy people would
think there's something wrong with that
culture you know but this goes on and
nobody notices it well it's not 30 years
ago nobody with notice now some people
notice it and there's some concern over
what happened that's part of the
civilizing effect with the 60s and it
grew out of this leads into the more
important question out of just mass
popular organization of all kinds the
Central America solidarity movements of
the 1980s were something completely new
in the history of imperialism for a
number of reasons
they were first of all they were huge
secondly people didn't just protest they
didn't just have demonstrations they
went and lived with the victims there
were people who went and lived in
you know Salvadoran villages in the hope
that for one thing maybe they could help
them but in and for another reason
because maybe if there's a white face
around a little restrain the state
terrorists that the that their own
country was organizing that's never
happened before I mean no Imperial war
that I can remember did massive number
of citizens go to protect the victims of
the of their own country I mean that's a
level of engagement that is quite new
also interesting is that it was not
coming from the left some of them was
but not most of it in fact was mainly
rooted in conservative Christian
mainstream communities many of them
fundamental essence of that Christian
fundamentalist it was very deeply rooted
in mainstream us societies right out of
Main Street Iowa and it was very
courageous and very honorable and
something totally new well that's
another reflection of the same
developments and this does not come from
nowhere we all know where it comes from
it comes from people organizing in their
own community or their own workplace or
whatever group they happen to be
involved in integrating with one another
making bigger organizations linking up
by now the linkages are worldwide the
major movements by far are in the South
in countries like India and Brazil and
others those are by far the major
movements something close to them
they're not noticed much in the West
because who cares what those people are
doing but that's the source of the anti
corporate globalization movement and
plenty of other things I mean you not
have to tell you
way more about it than I did with the 70
right here that's the way things change
every significant change in history has
come about that way and the next ones
will too and I think the next ones could
be closer than we think
because the system of domination is
extremely fragile as I mentioned and
they know it you know that's why it's
based on such extensive secrecy you know
let people know what's going on it's
gonna collapse and that can hold
together for a while but it's a fragile
system and we know just how to change it
by popular organization that takes
doesn't just oppose what's going on but
creates Bakunin you have to create the
facts of the future in the present
society you have build up the kinds of
institutions that should exist in the
future society and let them begin to
work and to flourish whether they're you
know workers control and Industry or
community conducting cooperative
villages women's groups whatever it may
be start building them let them work and
function they'll be the future once
concentrated power is so weakened that
it can't survive how you get the changes
you can't predict but that's the path
that's but it's worked in the past
that's why we don't live under feudalism
and slavery and kind of horrors of the
past that are mostly gone and that's the
way you're doing all these will hand
over to Professor Chomsky so that in at
least you can feel that it's reached him
in some way you will get an answer
sometime now questions from the press we
have really just ten minutes
so wherever you are if if you can ask
them rapidly and so me I take the mic
what will be the effect if India
continues with accepting neoliberalism
and integrating into the global economy
on neoliberal terms well I think there's
a couple centuries of history that give
you an answer to that you know there are
differences of course but in many ways
this what happened since the 18th
century England imposed a very liberal
regime on India meanwhile England itself
maintained a very powerful state the
most powerful in Europe a very high
protection it had a labor management
system which was quite different from
India's actually if you're interested
there's very interesting scholarly work
on this just coming out the Cambridge
University series on Indian history and
development has just published a book a
couple months ago by pressing on a
Parthasarathy personal friends based on
a harvard dissertation i forget the
title of the book but it's about weavers
in south india in the 18th century and
by the 19th but but in the 17th 18th
century i mean by the early 19th century
the weavers in south india was a total
disaster story of the weavers were
bleaching the plains of India and all
that in the 18th century they're doing
quite well in fact his investigations
show fairly convincingly that they were
better off than workers in England at
higher purchasing power much more
control of their work there was a much
they were mobile you know the the the
this was ended by British state power
the British came in first released India
Company which is basically a state
outfit and then just both force and they
introduced British style
labor-management rules that meant
cutback mobility so that workers don't
as was not in England control mobility
so that people can resist by going
somewhere else
impose tight restrictions that break
down the market relations which did
exist in India and that smashed the
weavers it's by so within a century you
get a disaster which still continues and
if you look at the history that's the
way it's been I mean countries that were
compelled to adopt real market
principles were destroyed and those who
somehow were able to control their own
destiny because they resisted
colonization and invariably relied quite
heavily armed state intervention for
development often not in all pretty ways
they developed if India decides to go
back to what it was in the 18th century
you can kind of predict what will happen
and you'll have a sector I mean right
through the Raj there was a sector of
extreme wealth in India you know there's
a sector of Indian society that was very
wealthy I mean the garage was run by
Indians not by British British were in
the background but the place was mostly
run by Indians even the army you know I
mean until the until the
18:58 anglo-indian war the army was
mostly boys they're controlling the
Indian population furthermore that's the
way it is in every other country - so
there'll be a sector of Indian society
that will do fine
most of the population will suffer the
general economy will be reliant on
outsiders won't be able to control
itself and somehow probably relive the
past that's what I would suspect on the
other hand this you know of course the
world isn't the same as it was 200 years
ago is this not obvi a duplicate but the
patterns are pretty clear as I mentioned
just to just think about it there's not
a single society that is rich and
developed today that followed liberal
principles not a single one every single
one of them radically violated cluding
England and in England did finally turn
to free trade in 1846 but at that time
England had already achieved twice the
per capita capitalisation of any other
country so the playing field looked
level in our direction by that time
Indian manufacturers been pretty much
destroyed and even after in free trade
period you know England didn't rely on
free trade I mean I think about 40
percent of in the of English exports
went to India that's it : it's not free
trade but when England could no longer
compete with Germany in manufacturing it
still had to control Indian market this
continued until the 1920s in the 1920s
England was literally no longer able to
compete with Japanese manufacturing so
they simply called coal the whole game
off in 1832
England closed off the whole empire
including Indian to Japanese imports
that's part of the background for the
Pacific War the dutch did the same in
what was then the East Indies the United
States did the same in the Philippines
well yeah it's part of the background
for the Second World War
I mean everybody's perfectly happy with
free trade as long as we're gonna win no
if it looks like there's some problem
then you stop it and that's true right
up to the prison I mean the United
States is a perfect example I mentioned
the national security exemptions the
national security exemptions in the WTO
are just a way for the United States to
have a very dynamic state sector which
is the innovative part of the economy
where the public pays the costs when
Ronald Reagan nobody was more full of
passionate rhetoric about free trade
than the Reagan eyes they were the most
protectionist government in post-war US
history they double barriers to import
their bitterly than ounce by GATT you
know the predecessor of the WTO carving
led the assault against free trade but
that didn't stop him from spouting the
wonders of free trade for somebody else
yeah the same right to the prisoner I
mean Clinton full of talk about the
wonders of the International economy but
when Florida agribusiness couldn't
compete with Mexican tomatoes his
bandmates and tomatoes
they happen to violate mastered but you
know who cares about that when us super
computer makers couldn't compete with
Japan because they were making better
supercomputers they banned clintonb and
Japanese super computers okay don't
matter what the trade rules
you do if you're powerful enough you do
what you like and and everyone sort of
agrees what are they going to do but you
know the historical record is pretty
clear honors and I think you can pretty
well predict where it'll lead in fact I
think you can see it happening in India
recent years there was another question
I'm sorry I didn't catch it
deep politicization coming from the NGOs
nasty well I mean all of you know that's
a it's a very double-edged kind of
business I mean there many NGOs do
really good things on the other hand one
of the effects of the NGOs quite
commonly is to take decisions away from
the communities and also to give the
state an excuse not to be concerned with
the things that ought to be concerned
with like health and education and so on
so I these are paths that if the NGOs
are serious you know a lot of are just
kind of power agencies agencies of some
of the states or corporations or
whatever but the ones that are seriously
concerned with authentic development of
democratization and rights they have to
be very wary of this they should follow
the lead of the communities not dictated
and they should not provide a means for
the governing authorities to transfer
power to corporations and say we're I'm
going to care about health and welfare
and there's no simple answer many of the
they deal with these things in different
ways some of them I think do pretty well
like good I'm gonna take Oxfam far as
I'm aware around the world it's handled
these problems reasonably well others
see results are not so good
I think democracy might be a good idea
it reminds me of the statement
attributed to Gandhi was actually he
said it or not it was supposed to have
been asked what he thought about Western
civilization and the answer was supposed
to be it might be a good idea I think he
can say the same about democracy true
functioning democracy meaning local
control of decision-making in any
structure whatsoever community a
workplace you know collective peasant
Association I mean there's all kinds of
forums that should be the basis of a
decent reasonable society with further
integration and Federation from the
bottom up as is feasible and beneficial
all the way to international
organizations and this is just the
traditional anarchist idea and it's a
kind of the natural direction in which
the commitment democracy oughta lead I
think and there are plenty of barriers
to be overcome in fact just think of the
barriers in the 20th century there were
three forms of totalitarianism that
developed Bolshevism fascism and
corporations they really are three forms
of totalitarianism and in fact I have
the scene pretty
the same intellectual roots they come
out of neova galleon ideas about the
rights of organic entities over
individuals big attack on classical
liberalism well two of those forms if
the Talat arianism were overthrown the
third one is rampant but it's no more
graven in stone and the other two fact I
think it's weak is good man but the same
kind of course of force behind it so it
can be overthrown - in favor of
democratic people thank you very much
please don't move yet as we said earlier
our interior I said we have a lot of
work to do I think that's very true and
I think that has been amplified many
times over by Chomsky in these responses
so if you can please stay on for the
marsh Noam Chomsky has very kindly
agreed to join the beginning of the
March before that let me very briefly
thank all the speakers and the
participants and we'll have a very brief
farewell song before we move please
don't move yet just after the song we'll
get moving
thank you
