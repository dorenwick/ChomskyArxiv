[Applause]
thanks uh not very long ago as you all
recall it was taken for granted that the
uh Iraq war would be the central uh
issue in the 2008
election as it was in the midterm
election two years ago however it
virtually uh disappeared off the radar
screen which has elicited some
puzzlement among the uh
punditry uh actually the reason is not
very obscure it was cogently explained
40 years ago uh when the US invasion of
South Vietnam was in its fourth year uh
and The Surge of that day was about to
add another 100,000 troops to the
175,000 already there uh while South
Vietnam was being bombed to sh spr at
triple the level of the bombing of the
North and the war was expanding to the
rest of Indochina however the war was
not going very well uh so
uh uh the former Hawks were shifting
towards doubts among them the
distinguished historian Arthur schinger
maybe the most distinguished historian
of his generation Kennedy adviser uh who
and he and Kennedy other Kennedy
liberals were beginning to reluctantly
beginning to shift from uh dedication to
Victory to a more doish position and
Schlesinger explained the reasons he
explained that uh I'll quote him now of
course we all pray that the Hawks are
right in thinking that the surge of that
day will work and if it does we may all
be saluting the wisdom and statesmanship
of the American government in winning a
victory in a land that we have turned he
said to wreck and ruin but the surge
probably won't work uh at an acceptable
cost to us uh so perhaps strategy should
be
rethought well the reasoning and the uh
underlying attitudes carry over with
almost no change to the critical
commentary on the uh US invasion of Iraq
today and it is a land of wreck and ruin
already heard a few words I don't have
to review the fact the uh highly
regarded British polling agency Oxford
research Bureau has just updated its
estimate of deaths their new estimate a
couple of days ago is 1.3 million that's
excluding two of the most violent
provinces carala and
anbar uh on the side it's kind of
intriguing to to uh observe the ferocity
of the debate over the actual number of
deaths there's an assumption on the part
of the Hawks that if we only killed a
couple hundred thousand people it would
be okay so we shouldn't accept the
higher estimates you can go along with
that if you like uh uncontroversially
there are over 2 million displaced
within Iraq uh thanks to the generosity
of Jordan and Syria uh the millions of
refugees who have fled the W wreckage of
Iraq aren't totally wiped out that
includes most of the professional
classes but that welcome is fading uh
because uh Jordan and Syria receive no
no support from the uh perpetrators of
the crimes in Washington and uh London
and therefore they cannot uh accept that
huge burden for very long uh just going
to leave those two and a half
million refugees who fled in even more
desperate Straits uh the sectarian
Warfare that was uh uh created by The
Invasion never nothing like that had
ever existed before that has uh
devastated the country as you know much
of the country has been subjected to
quite brutal ethnic cleansing and left
in the hands of Warlords and militias uh
that's the
primary thrust of the current
counterinsurgency strategy that's
developed by uh the
revered Lord Petraeus I guess we should
describe him considering how the way
he's uh treated uh he won his Fame by
pacifying mosul a couple of years ago
it's now the scene of some of the most
extreme violence in the
country one of the uh one of the most
dedicated and uh
informed journalists who has been
immersed in the ongoing tragedy uh near
Rosen has just written an Epitaph
entitled the death of Iraq in the uh
main very mainstream and quite important
Journal current history uh he writes
that Iraq has been killed never to rise
again the American occupation has been
more disastrous than that of the Mongols
who sacked Baghdad and the 13th century
which has been the perception of many
Iraqis as well only fools talk of
solutions now he went on there is no
solution the only HP hope is that
perhaps the damage can be
contained uh but uh Iraq is in fact the
marginal issue and the reasons are the
traditional ones the traditional
reasoning and attitudes of the liberal
doves who all pray now as they did 40
years a ago that the Hawks will be right
and that the US will win a victory in
this land of wreck and ruin and they're
either encouraged or silenced by the
good news about Iraq and there is good
news uh the US occupying Army in Iraq uh
euphemistically it's called the
multinational Force Iraq uh because they
have I think three poles there somewhere
uh that uh the uh occupying Army carries
out extensive studies of popular
attitudes it's an important part of
counterinsurgency or any form of
domination want to know what your
subjects are thinking uh and it released
a report last December uh it was a study
of focus groups and it was
uncharacteristically
upbeat uh the report concluded I'll
quote it that the survey of focus groups
provides very strong evidence that
National reconciliation
is possible and
anticipated contrary to what's being
claimed the survey found that a sense of
optimistic possibility permeated all
focus groups and far more commonalities
than differences are found among these
seemingly diverse groups of Iraqis from
all over the country and all walks of
life uh this discovery of shared beliefs
among Iraqis throughout the country is
good news according to a military
analysis of the results Karen D young
reported in the Washington Post a couple
of weeks ago well uh the shared beliefs
are identified in the report I'll quote
the young uh Iraqis of all sectarian and
ethnic groups believe that the US
military invasion is the primary root of
the violent differences among them and
see the departure of what they call
occupying forces as the key to National
reconciliation so those are the shared
beliefs uh according to Iraqis then
there's hope of national
reconciliation if the Invaders who are
responsible for the internal violence
and the other atrocities if they
withdraw and leave Iraq to Iraqis uh
that's pretty much the same as what's
been found in earlier polls so it's not
all that
surprising well that's the good news
shared beliefs uh the report didn't
mention some other good news so I'll add
it uh Iraqis it appears uh accept the
highest values of Americans that ought
to be good news specifically they accept
the principles of the nurenberg tribunal
that sentenced Nazi war criminals to
hanging for such crimes as supporting
aggression uh and preemptive war was the
main charge against uh fun ribet trop
for example whose position was in the
Nazi regime was that of Colin Powell and
K Lisa Rice uh the tribunal defined
aggression very straightforwardly it's
in aggression in its words is the
invasion of its Armed Forces by one
state of the territory of another state
simple uh obviously the invasion of Iraq
and Afghanistan are textbook examples of
aggression and the tribunal as I'm sure
you know went on to uh characterize
aggression as the Supreme intern
National Crime uh differing only from
other war crimes in that it contains
within itself all the accumulated evil
of the whole so everything that follows
from the aggression is part of the evil
of the aggression uh well the good news
from the US military survey of focus
groups is that Iraqis do accept the
nberg principles they understand that
sectarian violence and the other
post-war Horrors are contained within
the Supreme International crime
committed by the
Invaders uh I think they were not asked
whether their acceptance of American
values extends to the conclusion
of Justice Robert Jackson Chief
prosecutor for the United States at
Newberg he forcefully insisted that the
tribunal would be mere farce if we do
not apply the principles to ourselves
well uh needless to say the
US opinion shared with the West
generally flatly reject the lofty
American values that were professed at
nberg uh indeed regards them as
bordering un obscene as you could
quickly discover if you try uh
experimenting by suggesting that these
values should be observed as Iraqis
insist it's an interesting illustration
of the reality some of the reality that
lies behind the famous Clash of
civilizations maybe not exactly the way
we like to look at it uh there was a
poll a few days ago uh really a major
poll just released which found that 75%
of Americans believe that US foreign
policy is driving the dissatisfaction
with America abroad and more than 60%
believe that dislike dislike of American
values and of the American people are
also to blame dissatisfaction is a kind
of an understatement the United States
has become increasingly the most feared
and often hated country in the world uh
well that perception is in fact
incorrect it's fed by Propaganda there's
very little dislike of Americans in the
world shown by repeated polls and the
dissatis action that is the hatred and
the anger uh they come from acceptance
of American values not rejection of them
and recognition that they're rejected by
the US government and by us aites which
does lead to hatred and anger U there's
other good news that's uh been reported
by General General Petraeus and
Ambassador Ryan Crocker uh that was
during the travaganza that uh was stag
staged last September
11th uh September 11th might ask why the
timing well a cynic might imagine that
the timing was intended to insinuate the
bush Cheney claims of links between
Saddam Hussein and Osama B Laden they
can't come out and say it straight out
so therefore you sort of insinuate it by
devices like this
uh it's intended to indicate as they
used to say outright but are now too
embarrassed to say except maybe Cheney
uh that by committing the uh Supreme
International crime they were defending
the world Against Terror which in fact
increased Sevenfold as a result of the
invasion according to a recent analysis
by ter terrorism Specialists Peter
Bergen and Paul krook shank uh Petraeus
and Crocker provided figures uh to
explain the good news the figures they
provided on September 11th showed that
the Iraqi government was greatly
accelerating spending on reconstruction
which is good news indeed and remained
so until it was investigated by the
government accountability office which
found that the actual figure was six of
what Petraeus and Crocker reported and
in fact a 50% decline from the previous
here well uh more good news is the
decline in sectarian violence uh that's
attributable in part to the murderous
ethnic cleansing that has that
Iraqis uh blame on The Invasion uh the
result of it is there are simply fewer
people to kill so sectarian violence
declines it's also attributable to uh
the new counterinsurgency doctrine
Washington's decision to support the
tribal groups that had already organized
to drive out Iraqi
Al-Qaeda uh to an increase in US troops
and to the decision the decision of
the sers Mahi Army to U uh uh
consolidate its gains to stop uh direct
fighting and work politically that's
what the Press calls halting aggression
by the MTI Army notice that only only
Iraqis can commit aggression in Iraq uh
or or Iranians of course but no one else
uh well it's possible that uh Petraeus
strategy and may approach the success of
the Russians in
Chia where I'll quote the New York Times
a couple of weeks ago Chia the fighting
is now limited and sporadic and gry is
in the midst of a building Bo boom a
building boom after having been reduced
to Rubble by the Russian
attack uh well maybe someday Baghdad and
fua also will enjoy continue the quote
electricity restored in many
neighborhoods new businesses opening uh
and the city's main streets repaved as
in booming
grne possible but dubious uh in the
light of the likely consequence of
creating Warlord armies that may be the
seeds of even greater sectarian violence
uh adding to the accumulated evil of the
aggression well if Russians share the
beliefs and attitudes of uh Elite
liberal intellectuals in the west then
they must be praising Putin's uh wisdom
and statesmanship for his achievements
in Chia formerly they turned into a land
of reck and ruin and are now rebuilding
great
achievement uh a few days ago the uh New
York Times uh the military and Iraq
expert of the New York Times Michael
Gordon wrote a comprehensive review
first page comprehensive review of the
options for Iraq that are being faced by
the
candidates uh and he went through them
in detail described the pluses and
minuses and so on uh
rev
interviewing political leaders
candidates experts Etc there was one
voice missing uh
Iraqis uh their preference is not
rejected rather it's not mentioned uh
and it seems that there was no notice of
that fact which makes sense because it's
typical uh it makes sense on the tacit
assumption that underlies almost all
discourse on International Affairs the
tacit assumption without which none of
it makes any sense is that we own the
world and so what does it matter what
other thinks others think there are UNP
people nice
term invented by British Diplomat
diplomatic historian Michael Curtis it's
done a series of outstanding volumes on
Britain's crimes of Empire uh
outstanding work therefore deeply hidden
so there are the UN people out there and
then there are the owners that's us and
we don't have to listen to the UN un
people that uh conception that deeply
rooted Imperial mentality uh we find
everywhere we look constantly just pick
out a couple of examples more or less at
random from the last few weeks uh last
month Panama declared a day of mour to
commemorate the US invasion it's under
George Bush number one uh the uh it
killed the thousands of poor panamanians
when the US bombed the ELO slums other
poor areas so Panamanian human rights
organizations claim we don't actually
know because we never count our crimes
Victors don't do that only the defeated
uh it aroused no interest here there
barely mention of the day of M uh and uh
there was it's h well there's also no
interest in the fact that bush one's
invasion of Panama was a clear case of
aggression to which the nberg principles
apply and it was apparently more deadly
in fact possibly much more deadly than
Saddam Hussein's invasion of quate uh
happened a few months later uh but it
makes sense that there would be no
interest in that because uh we own the
world and Sadam didn't so the acts are
quite different it's also of no interest
that at that time of the time of
saddam's invasion of Kuwait uh the
greatest fear in Washington was that
Sadam would imitate uh what the United
States had just done in Panama namely
install a client government and then
leave uh the main it's the main reason
why Washington blocked diplomacy in
quite interesting ways with almost
complete media cooperation was actually
one exception in the US media uh so but
that none of this gets any commentary
however it does Merit a lead story uh a
few days later when the Panamanian
National Assembly was opened by
President Pedro Gonzalez who's charged
with by Washington with killing two
American soldiers during a protest
against President Bush number one
against his visit two years after the
invasion the charges were dismissed by
Panamanian courts but they're upheld by
the owner of the world so he can't
travel and that got a story well to take
Just One Last illustration of the depth
of the Imperial mentality uh New York
Times
correspondent uh Elaine shelino veteran
correspondent writes that Iran's
transigent about nuclear enrichment
appears to be defeating attempts by the
rest of the world to curtail taron's
nuclear
Ambitions uh well the phrase the rest of
the world is an interesting one uh the
rest of the world happens to exclude uh
the vast majority of the world namely
the nonline movement which forcefully
endorses Iran's right to enrich iranium
uranium in accordance with its uh with
the rights granted by its being a
signatory to the nonproliferation treaty
but they're not part of the world even
though they're the large majority
because they don't reflexively accept us
orders and commentary like that is
unremarkable and unnoticed you're part
of the world if you do what we say
Obviously otherwise you're UNP people uh
well we might uh since we're on Iran
might Parry for a moment
ask whether there's any solution to the
US Iran confrontation over nuclear
weapons which is extremely
dangerous here's one idea first point uh
Iran should be permitted to develop
nuclear energy but not nuclear
weapons uh as the nonproliferation
treaty determines a second point is that
there should be a nuclear weapons free
zone uh in the entire region uh Iran to
Israel including any US forces uh that
are present there actually but it's
never reported the United States has
committed to that position uh when the
US invaded Iraq 2003 it appealed to a UN
resolution resolution 687 which called
upon Iraq to eliminate its weapons of
mass destruction that was the flimsy
legal principle uh uh invoked to justify
The Invasion and if you look at
resolution
687 uh you discover that one of its uh
Provisions is that U the Us and other
powers must work to develop a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
including that entire region so we're
committed to it and that's the second
Poss
uh element of this proposal the third
element of The Proposal is that the
United States should accept the
nonproliferation treaty uh position
which happens to be supported by 82% of
Americans uh namely that it should
accept the requirements in fact a legal
requirement as the world Court
determined to move take make good faith
efforts to eliminate uh nuclear weapons
allog together and a fourth proposal is
that the US should turn to diplomacy and
it should end any threats against Iran
the threats uh are themselves crimes
they're in violation of the UN Charter
which bars the threat or use of force
well of course these four proposals
again Iran should have nuclear energy
but not nuclear weapons uh the there
should be a weapons free zone throughout
the region the US should accept the
nonproliferation treaty there should be
a turn to diplomacy and an end to
threats uh these are almost
unmentionable in the United States not a
single candidate would endorse any part
of them and they're never discussed and
so on however the proposals are not
original uh they happen to be the
position of the overwhelming majority of
the American population uh and
interestingly that's also true in Iran
uh roughly the same overwhelming
majority accepts all of these
proposals uh but that's the results are
come from the world's most prestigious
polling agency but not reported as far
as I could discover and certainly not
considered if they were ever mentioned
they would be dismissed with the phrase
politically impossible which is probably
correct it's only the position of the
large majority of the population kind of
like National Health Care but not uh not
of the people who count so there are
plenty of unpe here too in fact the
large majority uh Americans are share
this property of being unpe with most of
the rest of the world uh in fact if the
United States and Iran were functioning
not merely formal democracies then this
dangerous crisis uh might be uh readily
resolved by a functioning democracy I
mean one in which public opinion uh
plays some role in determining
policy uh rather than being excluded in
fact unmentioned because after all
they're UNP people well U while we're on
Iran I guess might as well turn to the
third member of the uh famous axis of
Evil North Korea there is an official
story read it right now uh is that the
official story is this that after having
been compelled to accept an agreement on
dismantling its nuclear weapons and the
facilities uh after having been
compelled to agree to that North Korea
is again trying to evade its commitment
its usual devious way so the New York
Times headline on this 10 days ago reads
uh United States sees stalling by North
Korea on nuclear
pack and the article then details the
charges of how North Korea is uh not
going through with its
responsibility uh it's
not it's not the releasing information
that this promised to release uh if you
read the story to the last paragraph and
that's always a good idea that's where
the interesting news usually is when you
read a news story but if you manage to
get to the last paragraph uh you you
discover that it's the United States
that has backed down on the pledges made
in the agreement the United States had
had promised to provide a million tons
of fuel and uh what do I do I couldn't
see I'm
sorry I should hurry up yeah okay all
right just start screaming at me if I go
on one uh the U the US just refused to
supply it it's refused only it supplied
only 85% of the fuel that it promised uh
and it was supposed to improve
diplomatic relations of course not doing
that well that's quite normal you want
to find out what's going on in the US
North Korea uh nuclear standoff it's
better you have to go to the specialist
literature which is uniform on it
nothing hidden and in fact sort of
sneaks out in the small print and the
Press reports as I mentioned uh what you
find is that U the north I me North
Korea may be the most hideous state in
the world but that's not to the point
here uh its position has been pretty
pragmatic it's kind of tit fortat the
United States gets more aggressive they
get more aggressive the United States
moves towards diplomacy and negotiations
they do the same so when President Bush
came in uh there was an agreement it's
called the framework agreement that had
been established in
1994 neither the United States nor North
Korea was quite living up to it uh but
it was more or less functioning uh at
that time North Korea under the the
framework agreement had stopped any
testing uh of long range missiles it had
maybe one or two bombs worth of
plutonium and it was verifiably not
making more that was uh when George Bush
entered the scene and now it has 8 to 10
bombs long range missiles that's
developing plutonium and there's a
reason the bush
regime immediately moved to aggress in a
very aggressive stance the a AIS of evil
speech was one example intelligence was
released claiming that uh North Korea
was carrying out was cheating had
clandestine programs now it's rather
interesting that these intelligence
reports five years later uh have been uh
quietly rescinded as probably uh uh
inadequate the reason presumably is that
uh if an agreement is reached there will
be inspectors in North Korea and they'll
find that this intelligence had as much
validity as the claims about Iraq so
they're being withdrawn uh well North
Korea responded to all of this by
ratcheting up its missile and weapons
development uh in September 2005 Under
Pressure uh the United States did agree
to uh negotiations and there were there
was an outcome uh September 2005 North
Korea agreed to abandon quoting all
nuclear weapons and existing weapons
programs and to allow International
inspection that would be in return for
international Aid mainly from the United
States and a non-aggression pledge from
the US and an agreement that the two
sides I'm quoting would respect each
other's sovereignty exist peacefully
together and take steps to normalize uh
relations well the United States the
Bush Administration had an instant
reaction it instantly renewed the threat
of force it froze North Korean funds and
foreign Banks it disbanded the
Consortium That was supposed to meet to
provide North Korea with a light Water
Reactor so North Korea returned to its
weapons and missile development carried
out a weapons test and confrontation
escalated well again under International
pressure and with its foreign policy
collapsing uh Washington returned to
negotiations that led to an agreement
which Washington is now
scuttling uh there's an earlier history
an interesting one uh you recall a
couple of weeks ago there's a mysterious
Israeli bombing in Northern Syria never
explained but it sort of hinted that uh
this had something to do with Syria
building nuclear facilities with help of
North Korea it's pretty unlikely but uh
whether it's true or not there's an
interesting background which wasn't
mentioned in
1993 uh Israel and North Korea were on
the verge of an agreement in which
Israel would recognize North Korea and
in return North Korea would agree uh to
terminate any weapons related missile
nuclear other any weapons related
activity in the Middle East that would
have been an enormous Boon to is
Israel's security uh but the owner of
the world stepped in Clinton ordered
them to refuse and of course you have to
listen to The Master's Voice uh so that
ended that uh and it may be that there
are North Korean activities in the
Middle East though we don't know about
them well let me finally uh return
to the first member of the acts of evil
Iraq uh Washington does have
expectations and they're explicit uh
they're outlined in a declaration of
principles uh that was
uh agreed upon if you can call it that
between the United States and the uh
us-backed uh us installed Iraqi
government government under military
occupation the two of them issued the
Declaration of principles it allows us
forces to remain indefinitely in Iraq in
order to deter foreign aggression well
the only aggression in sight is from the
United States but that's not aggression
by definition uh and also to facilitate
and encourage the flow of foreign
investments in Iraq especially American
Investments I'm quoting that's an
unusually Brazen expression of Imperial
will actually it was heightened a few
days ago when George Bush issued another
one of his signing statements declaring
that he will reject crucial provisions
of congressional
legislation uh that he had just signed
uh including the provision that forbids
spending taxpayer money quoting to
establish any military installation or
base for the purpose of providing for
the permanent stationing of us armed
forces in Iraq or to exercise Us control
of the oil resources of Iraq okay
shortly after the New York Times
reported that Washington insists if you
own the world you insist insists that
the Baghdad government give the United
States broad authority to conduct combat
operations a demand that that faces a b
potential Buzz saw of opposition from
Iraq with its deep sensitivities about
seeing as a depend being seen as a
dependent State it's supposed to be more
third world
irrationality so in brief uh the uh
United States is now insisting that Iraq
must agree to allow permanent US
military installations provide the
United Grant the United States the right
to conduct combat uh operations freely
and to guarantee Us control over the oil
resources of Iraq okay it's all very
explicit on the table it's kind of
interesting that these reports do not
elicit any reflection on the reasons why
the United States invaded Iraq you've
heard those reasons offered but they
were dismissed with ridicule uh now
they're openly conceded to be accurate
but not eliciting any retraction or even
any reflection well there's a lot more
to say about good news but I was told to
shut up so I will uh just say that uh
thinking about these things really does
give some insight uh into the famous
Clash of civilizations it's uh and its
actual substance topics that really
ought to be foremost in our minds I
believe thanks
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
so thank you to Professor chsky um we're
now G to open it up to a question and
answer period um we have two mics um at
either end of the stage on the floor if
people who want to um ask a question can
line up please and we'll um hopefully
get as many of your questions as we
can Professor chumsky I just want to
thank you for coming and I I wanted to
ask you um I lost the train of thought
that you were developing initially and
that was that there was a comparison
historically um with Vietnam and how the
war wasn't going well to the modern time
now with what's happening with with Iraq
and I was just going to ask you to pick
up that uh that train of thought that
you seen there was a as things turned
badly um um in in Vietnam and you were
going to make a parallel to the um the
current thing that was happening in Iraq
and I was just going to ask you well um
the position of the U liberal
doves uh in U in the case of Vietnam was
very much like what Schlesinger
described he put it eloquently uh we all
pray that the Hawks will be right that
by increasing the level of violence
we'll win uh even if we leave a land of
wreck and ruin doesn't matter much uh
but uh and if they win we'll be praising
the wisdom and statesmanship of our
leaders but it's costing us too much uh
so it's probably not going to work so
therefore we should look for another
strategy uh as quote one other one at
the end of the war 1975 Anthony Lewis
was about at the critical it's far to
the critical end of the media you can
discover uh reviewed the War uh he said
that it began the United States began
with blundering efforts to do good he
didn't have to say that because that's a
topology whatever action the holy State
undertakes his efforts to do good
blundering if it costs too much that's
probably historical Universal uh the uh
so it began with blundering efforts to
do good but by 1969 he said namely about
a year after the business Community
turned against the war because it was
too costly by 1969 it was clear that it
was a disaster uh which was costing us
too much so therefore we have to oppose
it U this is Maybe not a nice thing to
say uh but if but it's true so if you
don't mind they'll say it this is
exactly the reasoning of Nazi generals
after Stalingrad it was the right idea
you know but Hitler made a dumb mistake
they should have gotten rid of England
before invaded Russia the other way
around uh so it's costing us too much so
now we're dubs uh that carries over you
can re every time you open a newspaper
or an art a journal that's what you read
uh the hawk say you know if we keep uh
increasing the level of violence will
win the doves say we all pray that
you're right it's not going to work uh
and therefore when it seems that the
violence is being reduced for the
reasons I mentioned the Hawks are
jubilant and the doves either are quiet
or they try to say well it's not really
working but of course if it did work
we'd be praising your wisdom and
statesmanship uh that's the general
attitude of intellectual Elites it's not
the attitude of the population so in
1969 when the first polls were finally
taken about 70% of the American
population uh described the Vietnam War
as uh not a mistake but fundamentally
wrong and
immoral and those figures have remained
up until the most recent studies I think
the last early
2000 that's the unpe the people who
matter
uh the Smart Ones the educated ones uh
their position is pretty much like
Arthur Schlesinger's I should say to
Schlesinger another comment about
Schlesinger when in the case of the Iraq
War he's about the only person that I
can find among liberal intellectual
Elites who condemned the war on
principled grounds when the bombing of
Iraq started right away the first day he
uh wrote an article in which he said
that the bomb the day of the bombing of
Iraq he said is a date which will live
in infamy quoting Franklin Delano
Roosevelt uh on the day of Pearl Harbor
a date which will live in infamy as the
United States follows the policies of
fascist Japan that was Arthur
Schlesinger this time but you don't see
that mentioned take a look at the
obituaries not that his principal
opposition to a war of aggression is
unmentionable his unprincipled
opposition uh as a liberal dove that's
held that's a comment about ourselves
not the population but the elite
intellectual sectors that we ought to
take pretty
seriously I mean maybe suppose that
Petraeus strategy works and the United
States succeeds in doing what the
Russians did in Chia I mean do we praise
Putin for having destroyed Chia and now
rebuild beginning to rebuild
it do we praise him for the fact that
they now have electricity and there's a
building boom and gry after having they
turned into
Rubble I don't see that anywhere I with
regard to others we can keep to
Elementary moral principles when we're
talking about
ourselves it's not unimaginable it's
considered outrageous I mean it elicits
a horror and Tantrums it's an
interesting fact about the reigning
intellectual culture and again it's not
just true of the United States that's
true throughout
history doesn't mean it has to be true
or that we should tolerate
it and does that get at what you were
asking
yeah I only see one microph oh okay can
you talk about the terms of the deal
that Iran offered us shortly after 9/11
where they offered us everything we're
now asking for and we subsequently I'm
sorry I can't hear maybe stand a little
back for the microphone can you hear me
now yeah okay I was just wondering if
you could talk about the terms of the
deal that Iran offered us shortly after
911 where they offered us everything
we're now asking for and we we we
refused it subsequently denied it it was
it was not right after 911 I they were
making moves even before that but the
major one I think the one you're
referring to was in early
2003 uh when uh the hatami government
the moderate Iranian government offered
the United States uh actually we now
have the exact offer you can find it on
the Washington Post website so no
question about it they offered the
United States uh uh a discussion
negotiation on all outstanding issues
all nuclear issues on recognition of
Israel uh everything uh that offer the
US doesn't have formal relations with
Iran we reject refused to so the offer
was brought to Washington by uh the
Swiss uh amb Emissary who's the mediator
between Iran and the United States the
Bush Administration received the offer
and responded namely they censured the
Swiss Emissary for bringing it okay that
was the end of that one nevertheless uh
Iran preceded in
2004 uh Iran and the European Union
entered into
negotiations uh and Iran agreed rather
surprisingly in my view but they agreed
to suspend uranium enrichment which
they're legally entitled to do as the
UNP people of the world
recognize uh they suspended uranium
enrichment uh during the negotiations
and they wanted a quid proquo that the
European Union should do something and
what they asked them to do uh was to uh
uh end uh threats of force and violence
against Iran okay well European Union
couldn't do that because the owner of
the world in Washington wouldn't permit
it uh so after a couple years of
negotiations and failure of the United
States to provide of the European Union
to provide security guarantees Iran
withdrew and returned to enriching
uranium read the reports of that and
you'll see okay you can't trust the
Iranians you know they're back defying
the world again
but that's what happened uh and uh the
options could be pursued today the
positions that I read which I think are
pretty sensible those proposals happen
to be the opinion of the overwhelming
majority of people in both the United
States and Iran and they would probably
end the crisis at least mitigate it but
of course you know the people who take
these positions in the United States
probably each person who answers in a
poll must think I'm the only person in
the country who thinks these crazy
things they certainly never read it
anywhere they never see it anywhere the
polls when they come up with results
like that as they regularly do are just
not reported uh if these were matters of
discussion I think the percentage would
not be like 75% but probably be like
90% okay but that's one of the reasons
why you have to keep from discussing
it yes Professor um I just wanted to see
if we could turn our attention to a
different tentacle of Imperial power and
that's South of the Border in uh chapis
and also in Waka Mexico where I uh I
personally just returned from a trip to
uh japas and what I was hearing before
and then and since then is that the
zapatista autonomous movement is facing
a severe increase in paramilitary and
military attack and there's a large
attack threatening against these
communities that I know provided a lot
of inspiration for many of the people in
this room and speaking of Waka now uh
waka but even now in Chiapas there is an
increased have you heard of this or do
you know what can you comment how we
actually a friends down there yeah
actually I was just happen to just be on
a a a
u documentary I spoken I spoke to a
group of activists in Waka recently a
meeting you I've been following uh I
don't know exactly what's going on in
chapas but in ohaka it's been pretty
miserable able and brutal uh the Mexican
police are extremely brutal and when
they're supported by the United States
there's no bounds and what's happened in
Waka is pretty
awful chapas I'm not sure but probably
will come but but we did I don't know if
you had a question but um I just was
wondering if you had heard about the
increased pressure that they're facing
and uh Unfortunately they feel very
abandoned by the International Community
currently the zapa specifically in the
etln well they're abandoned because it's
not reported I mean in fact the
zapatistas survived only because uh they
made very
imaginative use of of media like the
internet so they were able to Garner
public support which uh restricted the
capacity of the Federalist you know the
the
Mexican Army and police or basically
terrorists they restricted their ability
with us backing to just crush them I'm a
phys materially they could have done it
but with a tremendous amount of
international support they had to back
off that happens over and over
International solidarity makes a huge
difference uh just to take another
example which is pretty stunning uh in
Bolivia which is a remarkable
situation uh the uh in December 2005
they they had the most democratic
election I've ever heard of
certainly you
know totally different from the charade
that's going on here uh there was a Oh
literally it's a serious point and we
should think about it I mean I don't
have to talk about what's going on here
you know very well in Bolivia the
overwhelming majority of the population
which happens to be indigenous uh for
the first time in 500 years uh entered
the political Arena and succeeded in
electing somebody from their own ranks
with issues that everybody knew about
and that were extremely important uh the
election wasn't based on whether one of
the candidates shed a tear or you know
another one looks you straight in the
eye or whatever it may be the elections
was U uh fought on issues like uh
cultural rights like taking control of
your own resources I mean things that
really matter to people things issues
that don't even enter the discussion
here and and they elected a poor peasant
from their own
ranks that doesn't happen this kind of
election doesn't take place in the west
uh but it took place and uh Morales who
basically is a representative of the
people it's not you know it's not rule
from above is proceeding with those
demands he's bitterly condemned in the
west as authoritarian or
dictatorial uh because he's following
the wishes of about 90% of the
population as for example when they move
towards nationalization of oil bitterly
condemned here as authoritarian and
dictatorial failing to mention that yeah
practically everybody supported it uh
the uh going back to the solidarity this
is in Bolivia they didn't just go to the
polls on Election Day and push a button
like we're supposed to do this is a
constant struggle the people who took
part in winning the election had been
struggling about this for years and
struggling I mean like Waka you know
getting killed by military by the
military by the military and police and
so on over real issues uh the main one
was in coacha Bamba where they were uh
the government the previous government
was following the instructions of the
World Bank and uh the United States you
lies behind it uh to uh private
privatize water well you take an
economics course you know you may learn
a theorem which says that it's good to
privatize water because do lot of
wonderful things and then there's what
in economics is called an externality
that's something we don't consider
because it sort of messes up the model
the externality in this case is that
people can't afford to buy it so they
starve but that's somebody else's
business uh abstractly in some abstract
World it turns out that this works
better well the peasants of coacha
didn't accept it and they struggled
against it and they succeeded in driving
Beckel uh out of the country it's better
than we did here when Beckel was robbing
Us blind on The Big Dig will have to be
rebuilt in a couple of years uh they uh
they drove him out and uh solidarity
made a big difference it happened that
that struggle in coach obamaa was peing
at the time of a meeting of the
Regional groups of the World social
Forum in Washington there was big
demonstrations about the IMF and the
World Bank happened to be at the same
time and again with clever use of the
internet uh activists in bivia were able
to activate protests in Washington in
Seattle and California where beckel's
located in London you know all over the
place uh protests against the bank and
the corporations and the
Dr them out and that's part of the one
part important part of the move towards
uh the elections in coach that took
place in Bolivia so solidarity not only
can make a big difference it can save
people from
destruction I mean if you take a look at
the balance of military forces I mean if
that's all that mattered it's obvious
what would happen in the world you know
naism would look gentle uh what prevents
it is uh popular engagement to prevent
predatory and violent institutions
States and private from doing what they
want and the same was true in chapas and
it ought to be true in Waka but
unfortunately it isn't because people
don't know about
it doing a presentation next my name is
Carl Curts and uh bnot bombs was founded
at the time of the Reagan Era and
recently in the media
this uh this icon of the past has risen
again and he's lauded to by the
Republicans who hold debates in the
Reagan Library as well as the Democrats
and remaking of this ethical
conservative uh is really repugnant to
me and I wish that you could comment on
this and give us a little historical
background of what's to expect from the
Reagan doct back off a little bit from
the microphone I didn't catch everything
if you get too close to the microphone I
can't hear got it um my my question or
my um request is for can you hear me now
um my request is that you elaborate on
the remaking of the image of Ronald
Reagan oh yeah that's interesting and
the the history coming forward today um
bikes not bombs were sort of born at
this time the Reagan Doctrine yeah bikes
not bombs I think is 1984 is that
correct 1984 yeah in 1984 uh in 1984 was
an important year in Nicaragua they uh
they had a democratic election a free
democratic election very carefully
monitored International monitors British
parliamentary human rights inquiry Irish
government parliamentary inquiry the
Dutch government which is very hostile
the Sistas had an official inquiry the
Latin American studies Association it's
professional group of Latin American
Scholars that not only went to monitor
the election but uh they sent
Specialists who' done field work in
Nicaragua there for several weeks
beforehand they all reached the same
conclusion it was a very free and fair
election uh the Sistas won the election
okay they're un people remember so the
position of the US government was the
election didn't take place and
approximately 100% of the media took the
same position uh in fact they staged a
way of trying to Drive the election off
the front pages uh they staged a uh u a
delivery an alleged delivery of migs
Russian migs to Nicaragua right at the
time of the election and uh the of
course front pages are Russians
delivering migs to Nicaragua you know
threat to the United States fact not
long after Reagan called declared a
National Emergency because of the threat
to the security of the United States
osed by the government of Nicaragua uh
which you'll remember was only two days
away from harling and Texas I mean we
just about to be destroyed by these
hordes and the media went along and
commentary went along I mean some were
skeptical they said well maybe like our
senator Paul tangas liberal Senator said
well you know maybe they really aren't
sending migs but if they are we got aama
uh because obviously we can't allow migs
to be in a country like Nicaragua which
could destroy us if they if they try uh
okay it took care of the election
incidentally why would Nicaragua want
migs of course it was all a fraud but
why might they have wanted migs this
really shows you something about the
Imperial mentality I then conceivable
reason in fact Nicaragua had requested
jet planes from France but the US uh
barred that they did not want Nicaragua
to have planes from a western Ally they
wanted them to get him from Russia
that's an old trick that's the way they
overthrew the government of Guatemala
force them threaten them with an attack
try to get them to defend themselves
block any help from your allies compel
them to go to your enemies then present
them as a threat to our existence I mean
somebody's watching this from Mars they
think the country is insane how could
the Nicaragua be two days from harling
in Texas but you know it sells here
among educated people anyway in fact
they did need need airplanes namely to
protect their airspace the US had total
control of their airspace was using it
uh to support the contras the mercenary
forces that were using to carry out
Terror in Nicaragua which were you know
the most
uh not like ordinary gorillas I mean
they had computers they had planes up in
the they had uh CIA planes which were
sending them signals telling them where
the Nicaraguan Army was so that they
could attack soft targets UND defended
civilian targets actually official
policy uh so yeah they wanted to protect
their airspace but they knew that they
better not get jet planes or the United
States will go berser uh anyway that did
knock the election off the front pages
everything you read says the first
election was in
1990 that one was okay because after
battering
