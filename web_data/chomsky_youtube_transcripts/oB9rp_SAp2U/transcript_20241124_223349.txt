it's uh hardly a secret that the terms
of political discourse are not exactly
models of
precision and considering the way terms
are used it's next to impossible to try
to give a meaningful answer answer to
such questions as uh what is socialism
or what is capitalism or what are
markets free markets and many others in
common usage and that's even more true
of the term anarchism for reasons that
uh Nathan pointed out it's been not only
subject to very varied use but also a
quite extreme
abuse sometimes by bitter enemies
sometimes
unfortunately by people who hold its
manner high so much
so so much is the variation and abuse
that it uh resists any simple
characterization in fact the only way I
can see to address the question that's
posed this evening what is anarchism is
to try to identify some leading ideas
that animate at least major currents of
the Rich and uh
complex and often contradictory
traditions of an anarchist thought and
crucially Anarchist
action well I think a sensible approach
can start with U remarks by the
perceptive important Anarchist
intellectual and also activist Rudolph
rocker I'll quote him he saw anarchism
not as a fixed self-enclosed social
system with a fixed answer to all the
multifarious questions and problems of
human life but rather as a definite
Trend in the historic development of
mankind which strives for the free
unhindered unfolding of all the
individual and social forces in life
it's from the
1930s uh these uh concepts are are not
really original they derive from the
Enlightenment and the early Romantic
Period uh in rather similar words uh
vilhelm Fon Hol one of the founders of
Classical liberalism among many other
achievements described the leading
principle of his thought as the absolute
and essential importance of human
development in its richest diversity
that's a phrase that John Stewart Mill
took as the epigraph to his on Liberty
it follows from that that institutions
that constrain such human development
are
illegitimate unless of course they can
somehow justify themselves uh you find a
similar conception widely in
Enlightenment thought so for example in
Adam Smith uh everyone has read the
opening paragraphs of Wealth of Nations
where he extols the wonders of division
of labor but not many people have gotten
farther inside to his bitter
condemnation of division of labor and
his insistence that in any civilized
society the government will have to
intervene to prevent it because it will
destroy personal integrity and essential
human rights will turn people he said
into creatures as stupid and ignorant as
a human can be it's not too easy to find
that passage uh whatever the reason may
be if you look in the uh scholar
standard scholarly Edition the
University of Chicago by Bicentennial
Edition it's not even listed in the
index well but it's one of the most
important passages in the
book uh uh looked at uh in these terms
anarchism is a tendency in human
development that seeks to identify
structures of hierarchy domination
Authority uh and uh others that
constrain human development
and then it seeks to subject them to a
very reasonable challenge justify
yourself demonstrate that you're
legitimate and maybe in some special
circumstances or conceivably in
principle uh and if you can't meet that
uh that challenge which is the usual
case the structure should be dismantled
and it's Nathan rightly adds not just
dismantled but reconstructed From Below
uh the ideals that found expression
during the Enlightenment and the
Romantic Era uh they foundered on the
shols of rising industrial capitalism
which is completely antithetical to them
but uh rocker argues I think quite
plausibly that they remain alive in the
libertarian socialist Traditions these
range pretty widely they range from left
anti-bolshevik Marxism that's people
like U Anon panak Carl kch Paul Maddock
and others including the anarchos
syndicalism that uh reached its peak of
achievement in the revolutionary period
in Spain in 1936 and it's well to
remember that despite its substantial
achievements and successes it was
crushed by the combined force of fascism
communism and Western democracy they had
differences but they agreed that this
had to be crushed the effort of free
people to control their own lives that
had to be crushed before they turned to
their uh Petty differences which are we
call the Spanish Civil
War uh the uh same uh the same
Tendencies reach further to uh worker
controlled
Enterprises they're springing up in
large parts the old Rust Belt in the
United States in northern Mexico they've
reached their greatest development in
the bass country in in Spain uh mandron
it's partly a reflection of the
achievements of the long complex Rich
Spanish tradition of anarchism partly it
comes out of Christian Anarchist sources
uh there's also included in this General
tendency are the quite substantial and
uh Cooperative movements that that exist
in many parts of the world and I think
it also encompasses at least a good part
of feminist and human rights activism
well in part all of this sounds like
truism so why should anyone defend
illegitimate
structures no reason of course and I
think that perception is correct it
really is truism I think anarchism is
basically ought to be called
truism but truisms have some merits one
of them is the Merit of being true
unlike most political discourse and this
particular truism belongs to an
interesting category of principles a
principles that are not only Universal
but doubly Universal they're Universal
in the they're almost universally
accepted and Universal in that they're
almost universally rejected and
practiced and this is one of there are
many of these for example the uh General
principle that we should apply to
ourselves the same standards we do to
others if not harsher ones a few would
object a few would practice it or more
specific uh policy proposals like uh
democracy promotion or humanitarian
intervention uh professed generally
rejected in practi practice almost
universally all doubly Universal and
this truism is the same the truism that
we should Challenge and uh uh coercive
institutions of all kinds demand that
they justify themselves dismantle and
reconstruction if they do not easy to
say but not so easy to act on in
practice uh well proceeding with similar
thoughts I'll quote rock rock again
anarchism seeks to Free Labor from
economic exploitation and to free
Society from ecclesiastical or political
Guardianship and by doing that opening
the way to an alliance of free groups of
men and women based on Cooperative lab
labor and a planned administration of
things in the interest of the community
now rocker was an anarchist activist as
well as political thinker and he goes on
to call on the uh workers organizations
other popular organizations to create
I'm quoting not only the ideas but also
the facts of the future itself within
the current Society that's an injunction
that goes back to
bakuna uh one traditional Anarchist
slogan is n NRA no God no master a
phrase that uh Daniel gon took as a
title of his very valuable collection of
anarchist
Classics uh I think it's fair to
understand the phrase no God in the
terms that I just quoted from rocker
opposition to
ecclesiastical
guardianship uh individual beliefs are a
different matter that's no matter of
concern to a person concerned with free
development of thought and action and
that leaves the door open to the Lively
and impressive tradition of religious
anarchism for example uh darthy
days very impressive Catholic Workers
movement but the phrase no master is
different that refers not to individual
belief but to a social relation a
relation of subordination and
dominance relation that anarchism if
taken seriously seeks to to dismantle
and rebuild From Below unless it can
somehow meet the harsh burden of
establishing its
legitimacy well by now we've departed
from truism in fact to ample
controversy in particular right at this
point the rather peculiar American brand
of what's called
libertarianism that departs very sharply
from the libertarian tradition it
accepts and indeed strongly Advocates
the subordination of working people to
the masters of the economy and
furthermore the subjection of everyone
to the restrictive discipline and
destructive features of markets these
are topics worth pursuing I'll take them
up later if you'd like but I'll put them
aside here although also recommending to
you uh Nathan's comment his suggestion
about bringing together in some way the
energies of uh the young libertarian
left and right as indeed sometimes done
for example it's done in the quite
important work of uh valuable
theoretical and practical work of
Economist David ellerman and some
others well anarch anarchism of course
is famously opposed to the state while
at the same time advocating planned
administration of things in the
interests of the community rockers
phrase again and beyond that uh broader
federations of uh uh self-governing
communities
workplaces well in the real world of
today the same dedicated anarchists who
are opposed to the state uh often
support state power to protect people
and society and the Earth itself from
from the ravages of concentrated private
Capital so takes a venerable Anarchist
Journal like Freedom uh goes back to
1886 formed as a journal of socialist
anarchism by uh by uh supporters of of
kotkin uh if you open its P Pages you'll
find that much of it is devoted to
defending uh uh rights of people the
Environ
uh Society Often by invoking state power
uh like regulation of uh uh the
environment or safety and health
regulations in the work place there's no
contradiction here is sometimes thought
uh people live and suffer and endure in
this world not some world that we imagin
and all the means available should be
used uh to to safeguard and uh benefit
them even if the long-term goal is to
displace these devices and construct
preferable
Alternatives uh in discussing this I've
sometimes used an image that comes from
the uh Brazilian workers movement it's
discussed in interesting work by be
maybery Lewis they speak of with they
use the image of widening the the floors
of the cage the cage is existing wor of
Institutions that can be widened by uh
committed popular struggle happened
effectively over many years and you can
extend the image Beyond uh think of the
cage of coercive State institutions as a
kind of protection from Savage beasts
that are roaming outside namely the
predatory State supported capitalist
institutions that are dedicated ated to
the principle of private gain power
domination with the interest of the
community at most a footnote maybe
revered in rhetoric but dismissed in
practice and in fact even in
anglo-american
law well it's worth also worth
remembering that anarchists condemned
really existing States not visions of
unrealized democratic dreams
such as Government of by and for the
people they bitterly opposed the uh rule
of what bakunin had called the red
bureaucracy which he predicted 50 years
in advance would be among the most
Savage of human creations and they also
opposed the Parliamentary systems that
are instruments of class rule uh the
Contemporary United States for example
which is uh not a democracy it's
autocracy that's very easy to
demonstrate majority of the population
has no influence over policy and as you
move up the income wealth scale you get
more and more influence the very top
people get what they want well
established by academic uh political
science but they familiar to everyone
who looks at the way the world Works uh
a truly democratic system would be quite
different
it would have the character of quote
again an alliance of free groups of men
and women based on Cooperative labor and
a planned administration of things in
the interest of the community in fact
that's not too remote from one version
of the mainstream democratic ideal
actually one version I stress that I'll
return to others so take for example the
leading American Social Phil philosopher
of the 20th century John dwey his major
concerns were democracy and
education no one took dwey to be an
anarchist but pay attention to his
ideas uh in his conception of democracy
illegitimate structures of coercion must
be dismantled and that includes I'll
quote him Domination by business for
private profit through private control
of banking land industry reinforced by
command of the press press agents other
means of publicity and
propaganda uh he recognized still
quoting that power today resides in
control of the means of production
exchange publicity transportation and
communication whoever owns them rules
the life of the country even if
Democratic forms remain and until these
institutions are in the hands of the
public politics Will Remain the shadow
cast on big cast by big business on
society very much what we see around us
in fact but it's important that dwey
went beyond calling for some form of
public control that could take many
forms uh he went beyond in a free and
Democratic Society he wrote the workers
should be the masters of Their Own
industrial fate not tools rented by
employers not directed by state
authorities now that position goes right
back to the leading ideas of Classical
liberalism articulated by F Hol Smith
others and extended in the anarchist
tradition turning to education do we
held that it is illiberal and immoral to
train children to work not free freely
and intelligently but for the sake of
the work earned to achieve test scores
for
example in which case their activity is
not free because it's not freely
participated in and it's quickly
forgotten too as all of us know from our
experience so he proceeded to conclude
that industry must be changed from a
feudalistic to a democratic social order
and educational practice
should be designed to encourage
creativity expiration Independence
Cooperative work exactly the opposite of
what's happening
today well these ideas lead to a vision
of society based on workers control of
productive institutions link to
community control within the framework
of free association and federal
organization in the general style of
thought that includ includes of course
along with many anarchists others too
say gdh koh's Guild socialism England
left anti-bolshevik Marxism the current
developments such as for example the
participatory economics and politics of
Michael Albert Robin hannell Steven
shalam and others along with important
work in theory and practice by the late
Seymour Melman his associates and uh
many others and U notably gar Al peritz
is very valuable recent contributions on
worker owned Enterprise and cooperatives
not just talk but actual taking place
well going back to dwey he was uh as
American as apple pie to borrow the old
cliche right in the mainstream of
American history and culture and in fact
all of these ideas and developments are
very deeply rooted in the American
tradition and in American history fact
which is kind of suppressed but is very
very obvious when you look into it and
when you pursue these uh questions you
enter into an important terrain of uh
inspiring often bitter struggle that's
ever since the dawn of the Industrial
Revolution which was right around here
LEL Lawrence Eastern Massachusetts mid
19th centur Cy uh the first serious
scholarly
work uh study of the U industrial worker
in those years was 90 years ago it's by
Norman wear still very much worth
reading uh he reviews uh the Hideous
working conditions that were imposed on
formerly independent Craftsmen and
immigrants and Farmers as well as U the
so-called Factory girls young women
brought from the Farms to work in the
textile mills around Boston he mentions
that he reviews it but he Focus his
attention on something else what he
calls the degradation suffered by the
industrial worker the loss of status and
Independence which could not be
cancelled uh even where there
occasionally was some material
Improvement and he focuses on the
radical capitalist social revolution in
which sovereignty economic Affairs
passed from the community as a whole
into the keeping of a special class of
Masters often remote from production a
group alien to the producers and where
shows I think pretty convincingly that
for every protest against machine
industry and privation there can be
found a hundred protests against the new
Power of capitalist production and its
discipline in other words workers were
struggling and striking not just for
bread but for roses in the traditional
slogan of the workers communities and
organizations they were struggling for
dignity and Independence for their
rights as free men and women and their
journals are very interesting there's a
rich and Lively labor press written by
working people Artisans from Boston
Factory girls from the farms uh in these
journals they condemned what they called
the blasting influence of monarchical
principles on Democratic soil which will
not be overcome until they who work in
the Mills will own them the slogan of
the massive Knights of Labor and
sovereignty will return to free and
Independent Producers then they will no
longer be menials or the humble subjects
of a foreign despot the absentee owner
slaves and the the strictest sense of
the word who toil for their masters or
rather they will regain their status as
free American
citizens the capitalist Revolution uh
instituted a crucial change from price
to wage it's very important when a
producer sold his product for a price he
retained his person but when he came to
sell his labor he sold himself I'm
quoting from the Press that's a big
difference he lost his dignity as a
person as he became a slave a wage slave
to use the common term of the period uh
160 years ago a group of skilled workers
repeated the common view that a daily
wage was equivalent to slavery and they
Wen warned perceptively that a day might
come when wage slaves will so far forget
what is due to manhood as to glory in a
system forced on them by their necessity
and in opposition to their feelings of
Independence and
self-respect a day that they hoped would
be far distant uh these were very
popular Notions in the mid 19th century
in fact so popular that they were a
slogan of the Republican party uh you
could read them in editorials of the New
York Times that's then not now but that
they may come back let's hope uh labor
activists of the time warned bitterly
often of what they call the new spirit
of the age gain wealth forgetting all
but
self that was a new spirit of the age
150 years ago and in sharp reaction to
this demeaning Spirit uh there were
quite enormous uh an active Rising
movements of working people and radical
Farmers uh radical Farmers actually
began in Texas uh spread through the
Midwest and much of the country was of
course an agricultural country then
these are the most significant
Democratic popular movements in American
history they were dedicated to
solidarity Mutual Aid uh it's a battle
they were crushed by force we have a
very V vient labor history as compared
with other countries but it's a battle
that's not over far from over despite
setbacks often violent
repression well there are apologists
familiar apologists for the radical
revolution of wage slavery and they have
an argument they argue that the worker
should indeed glory in a system of free
free contracts voluntarily
undertaken there was an answer to that
200 years ago by Shelly in a his great
poem Mask of Anarchy this was written
right after the peterloo massacre in
England Manchester when British Cavalry
brutally attacked a peaceful Gathering
of tens of thousands of people the first
major example of huge nonviolent protest
and the reaction of the state
authorities to it they were calling for
parliamentary reform
so Shelly wrote that we know what
slavery is it is to work and have such
pay as just keeps life from day to day
in your limbs as in a Cell for the
tyrants used to dwell is to be slave in
Soul and to hold no strong control over
your own Wills but be all that others
make of ye that's slavery that's what
working people and independent farmers
were struggling against and The Artisans
and Factory girls who struggled for
dignity and Independence and freedom
might very well have known Shell's words
uh observers at the time noted that they
were highly literate they had good
libraries they were acquainted with the
uh standard works of English literature
uh before this is before mechanism and
uh wage slavery the wage syst system uh
ended the days of at least curtailed the
days of Independence High culture and
security uh before that uh we points out
a workshop might be what he called a
lum journeyman would hire boys to read
to them while they worked these were
social businesses with many
opportunities for reading discussion
Mutual Improvement uh along with the
factory girls the Journeymen The
Artisans bitterly condemned uh the
attack on their culture the same was
true in England incidentally where
conditions were much harsher there's
actually a great book about this by
Jonathan Rose called the intellectual
life of the British working class it's a
Monumental study of the reading habits
of the working class of what we think of
as dzie in England and he contrasts what
he calls the passionate pursuit of
knowledge by proletarian
autodidacts with a pervasive
philistinism of the British
aristocracy actually I'm old enough to
remember residues that remained among
working people right here in New York in
the 1930s who were deeply immersed in
the high culture of the day it's another
battle that may have receded but I don't
think it's lost well I mentioned that uh
dwey and American workers and Farmers
held one version of democracy with very
strong libertarian elements uh but the
dominant version has been radically
different its most instructive
expression is at the progressive end of
the spectrum mainstream Spectrum so uh
that is PE among people who are good U
wro Wilson FDR Kennedy liberals uh
here's a few representative quotes from
icons of the liberal intellectual
establishment on democratic theory uh
the public are ignorant and metalsome
Outsiders they have to be put in their
place decisions must be in the hands of
an intelligent minority of responsible
men namely us and we have to be
protected from the trampling and Roar of
the bewildered herd out there The Herd
does have a function in a Democratic
Society they're supposed to lend their
weight every few years to a choice among
the responsible men but apart from that
their function is to be spectators not
participants in action and all of this
is for their own good that we should not
succumb to democratic dogmatisms about
men being the best judges of their own
interests they're not they're like young
children you have to take care of them
we are the best judges of their own
interests so their attitudes and
opinions have to be controlled for their
own benefit uh we have to regiment their
minds the way an army regiments bodies
we have to discipline the institutions
responsible for what they called the
indoctrination of the young uh schools
universities churches U if we can do
this we can get back to the good old old
days this is complaints about the 60s we
can get back to the good old days when
Truman had been able to govern the
country with the cooperation of a
relatively small number of Wall Street
lawyers and bankers then we'll have true
democracy these are quotes from uh icons
of the liberal establishment Walder
Lipman Edward Beres Harold lasswell
founder of modern political science
Samuel Huntington trilateral commission
which larly staffed The Carter
Administration well the conflict between
these conceptions of democracy goes far
back goes back to the earliest modern
democratic revolution in 17th century
England that time as you know a war
there was a war raging between
supporters of the king and supporters of
parliament that's the Civil War that we
read about but there was more uh the
Gentry the men who called themselves the
men of best quality they were appalled
by the Rabel who didn't want to be ruled
by either king or
Parliament like the Spanish workers in
1936 Nei side they wanted to be ruled as
they they had their own pamp pamphlet
literature and they said they wanted to
be ruled by countrymen like ourselves
that no air wants uh it will never be a
good World while Knights and G gentlemen
make us laws that are chosen for fear
and do but oppress us and do not know
the people's sores that's 17th century
England uh the essential nature of this
conflict Which is far from ended was
captured uh nicely by Thomas Jefferson
in his later years when he had serious
concerns about both the quality and the
fate of the democratic experiment he he
made a distinction between what he
called Aristocrats and
Democrats the aristocrats I'm quoting
him are those who fear and distrust the
people and wish to draw all powers from
them into the hands of the higher
classes the Democrats in contrast
identify with the people have confidence
in them cherish and consider them as the
honest and safe although not the most
wise depository of the public interest
the modern Progressive
intellectuals the Wilson Roosevelt
Kennedy intellectual left uh those who
seek to put the public in the their
place and are free from democratic
dogmatisms about the capacity of the
ignorant and metalsome Outsiders to
enter the political arena there
Jefferson's
Aristocrats these vasic views are very
widely held though there are some
disputes namely who should play The
Guiding role should it be what the
liberal intellectuals call the
technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals the ones we celebrate as
the Camelot
intellectuals uh who uh run the
progressive knowledge Society should it
be Bankers or corporate Executives in
other versions should it be the Central
Committee or the the guardian Council of
Clerks all pretty similar ideas and
they're all examples of the uh
ecclesiastical and political
guardianship that the genuine
libertarian tradition seeks to dismantle
and reconstruct From Below while also
changing industry from a feudalistic to
a democratic social order the one that's
based on workers control Community
Control respect the Dignity of the
producer as a genuine person not a tool
in the hands of others in accordance
with a Libertarian tradition that has
Deep Roots and like uh Marx's old mole
is always burrowing quite close to the
surface and ready to spring forth
