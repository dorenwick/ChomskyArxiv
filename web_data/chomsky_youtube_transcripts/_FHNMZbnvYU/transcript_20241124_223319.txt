your view what's wrong with private
ownership as the means of
production we should not have uh
relations of hierarchy dominance
subordination centralized control over
the means of life people who give ERS
applies all that yeah how if you have
private ownership of the means of
production it means that first of all
the people it's not just one person it's
a Institution so you get like maybe it's
a corporation or private business or
something first of all internally it's
essentially a totalitarian institution
almost necessarily there's a group at
the top maybe a person or a group
they make the decisions they give
orders people down the hierarchy get the
orders transmit them at the very bottom
you get people who are permitted to rent
themselves to Sur survive that's called
a job a wage labor and you get the
outside Community who's allowed to
purchase what you produce and of course
they're very heavily propagandized to
make them want to consume it even if
they don't so that's the nature of the
system it's kind of about as close to
totalitarianism as you can imagine
private Enterprise works just the way
Milton Friedman says you give the worst
possible service at the highest possible
profit that's what it means to be in the
business if you try to be benevolent
you're out of the business because
somebody undercuts you so the nature of
the system is Insight goes way back to
Adam Smith is to be as mean and rotten
as you can uh to try to maximize profit
and market share and give the worst
possible service thing with hmos and
everything else the system
is is EXT is has unacceptable risk built
into it uh it's well known among
economists that markets are inefficient
from the narrowest perspective so to
make it simple suppose you and I you
suppose you sell me a car okay we may
make a good deal for ourselves we're not
taking into account the effect on him uh
it's what's called an externality and
there's an effect if you sell me in a
car a car it increases gas prices
increases pollution increases congestion
and that extends very broadly these iCal
externalities can be very large now in
financial institutions it's far worse
they're in the business of taking risks
if they're well-managed they uh they
calculate the potential cost to
themselves if there's a loss but the
important words are to themselves they
don't calculate in what's called
systemic risk the effect on the whole
system if I make if I go bust you know
and has a huge effect uh the result is
that risk taking is underpriced meaning
there's a lot more of it than there
would be in a reasonable system but in
your role as CEO of a corporation you
are compelled to maximize profit and to
ignore what economists call
externalities that is the impact of your
transactions on others well that's why
we have repeated Financial crises ever
since Reagan and Thatcher the
deregulation of the financial
institutions means that the people who
run them have to ignore what's called
systemic risk the risk that a
transaction is going to bring down the
system and since you ignore it you're
increasing the probability of it and
therefore repeatedly happens so we
repeatedly have Financial crises each
one worse than the last markets are
supposed to be magnificent because they
increase your choices actually they
restrict your choices let me think about
it for a minute uh suppose I want to get
home from work at night okay the market
offers me a choice I can have a Ford or
a Toyota it does not offer me the choice
of a
Subway what I want what's good for me
what's good for the environment what's
good for my children but that's not
offered in the market markets offer
individual
consumption and the enormous stress
addess on the importance of markets is
part of the way to drive people towards
looking for
yourself amassing as many Commodities
you can forget everything else uh in
fact uh if you think about it every one
of you's taken an economics course or
read about it then you know what markets
are supposed to be uh markets are
supposed to be systems in which informed
consumers make rational choices right
right I'm sure every one of you's turned
on a television set and what do you see
when you turn on a television set you
see that there's a huge industry public
relations industry which began in the
United States and Britain incidentally
huge industry which is designed to
undermine markets every ad is an attempt
to create an uninformed consumer who
will make an irrational choice right
huge e on the part of the business world
to undermine markets but to keep the
aspect that's useful for profit and
power namely separating people from one
another focusing on individual choices
not working with your neighbor by now uh
about uh close to half the stock is
owned by about 1% of the population and
the bottom 80% of the population hold
about 4% of the stock uh and it's it's
always and this and the corporations are
interl like a bank alone a big piece of
one Corporation I mean it's a it's a
massive system of highly concentrated
power uh given the rights of immortal
persons but without the responsibility
of person these are amoral institutions
in fact there are private tyrannies
which are amoral and required to be
aoral uh they move towards so they want
to avoid Monopoly because then they get
public service requirements but they
want to be very limited uh so just a few
of them which can have what are called
strategic alliances they can effectively
act together
