ch
that International
Affairs uh Obama's
major step contribution if you like was
to launch the most extensive uh Global
terrorism campaign that the world has
yet seen this is the Drone assassination
Campaign which officially is aimed at uh
killing people who the administration
believes uh might someday intend to harm
the United States and killing anyone
else who happens to be
nearby uh that's uh there's been really
nothing like that in in the past I mean
this is quite an innovation in the
history of international terrorism it is
also a terrorism generating campaign
that's well understood by people in high
places when you murder somebody in a
Yemen Village and some maybe a couple of
other people are standing there the
chances are pretty high that uh others
will want to take revenge and that
Dynamic has been carried out quite
effectively uh if you look at the
history of what the West calls terrorism
Jihadi style terrorism it
U 15 years ago it was localized in a
small corner of uh Northwest Pakistan
and Afghanistan and tribal areas now
it's all over the world uh every part of
the world has practically has some major
so-called terrorist campaigns going on
uh and it's a natural development that's
what you expect from assassinating
people in the tribal areas which are
already pressed to the Pressed very hard
by central government policies
uh otherwise in international Affairs
there's nothing much to talk about he uh
continued to on Israel Palestine another
major Obama commitment uh he continued
to support the Israeli policies of
illegal settlement and development in
the occupied territories the repeated
vicious attacks against Gaza uh he went
so far as even to veto a security
Council resolution calling for uh
implementation of what is official US
policy namely expansion of the
settlements which is a minor issue it's
the settlements not expansion of them as
an issue but Obama Ved that
