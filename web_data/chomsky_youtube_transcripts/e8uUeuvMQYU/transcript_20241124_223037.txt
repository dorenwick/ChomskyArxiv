start the talk
uh i would like all of you
to
believe mute yourself
but that would be
problem to all of us there will be
annoying we cannot hear professor not
from clearly so i would request every
single person
please we have a large audience
throughout the world people are watching
right now so it is
we are so fortunate
right now so like we just want to
request all of you to please look
yourself
unless you meet you will not be able to
hear professor trump's clearly so like
please please do mute yourself
[Music]
academician of the world and uh
it is
very very we are fortunate to have him
and he and so jesus
he is so jealous to agree to speak at
this occasion so without taking much of
the time that the organ
the talk will be organized in such a way
that
uh professor nomsky will be speaking
after my brief introduction uh it is
like 45 40 minutes one hour how long
whatever convenient for him it is up to
him to speak we may give like brief ten
minutes for question answers uh
professor my colleague senior colleague
my teacher professor indiana will take
two questions uh from the audience uh i
will request all the participants
because this is large participants more
than thousand people and it's
coming up like you know so it will will
may go up two thousand three thousand
people all around the world will be
watching this
talk
so like i will request the professor in
their husbands to take few questions and
then at the end professor shavana
our another colleague will propose vote
of thanks so this is the uh the
sequence of the talk uh by professor
nakshaki we are very very fortunate as i
said earlier to have him and two teams
there were we were so excited
our university
our
white chancellor our all assistants we
are so excited having heard the name of
professor nob chomsky and
for the audience uh like he visited
india twice in 1996 and in 2001 i
remember and gave series of talks at
different places including uh delhi
university genuine southern india
and so we are so fortunate to see him
and uh
uh as i i
want to say a few words about him before
that since the department of lingual and
telegram muslim university is organizing
this so i briefly will touch upon
uh the philippines about the illegal
muslim university which occupies the
unique position amongst universities and
institutions of higher learning in india
it was established in
1877 as anglo-oriental
college which have become
a full-fledged university in 1920 and it
was started by a great visionary and
social reformer subsidies ahmed khan
from its very inception it has kept its
door open to the of all communities
and from all corners of the country and
the world the light muslim university is
the realization of a vision which was
broad challenging and realistic around 3
30 3
are studying in this university and it
is
a residential university
tenu is a living symbol of composite
culture of india and evolved of its
secular principles
of our department of linguistics was
founded in 1968
since its inception the department has
been providing excellent teaching and
in-depth research in linguistics with a
special reference to urdu language
department of linguistics is one of the
very few departments in india which
offer a full-fledged undergraduate
course in linguistics
the university
grant commission which control all the
academic institutions in india
are recognized as scholarly
contributions of the department in terms
of teaching and research as well as the
quantum of individual projects
successfully carried out by faculty
members
and thus awarded a special assistance
program to the department of linguistics
the phase one and phase two of the
drsfe have been completed
so we give you what about the department
and about the university i welcome you
all to this great talk
uh by professor nelson if the people are
watching from across country many
countries from u.s from philippines i
can see from morocco from yemen from
pakistan from bangladesh so and all
around india so we are so fortunate
uh to have him uh the greatest scholar
with us
so i'm just
and we all know that the
professor nom domsky the father of
modern linguistics is one of the most
cited scholars in modern history among
his ground breaking book our syntactic
language and mind aspects of theory of
systems and the minimalist program each
of which has made distinct contributions
to the development of the field
he has received numerous awards
including theo enterprise in basic
sciences
the helmet metal and the best friendly
metal in computers and cognitive types
professor norm zamsky is candidate
credited with revolutionizing the
linguistic field by introducing the top
key hierarchy generative grammar and the
concept of a universal grammar which
underlies all human speech and is based
in the innate structure of mind and
brain
professor chomsky has not only
transformed the field of linguistics
from his work has also influenced the
field of cognitive science philosophy
psychology computer science mathematics
childhood educators and anthropology
application of his work can be found in
everyday life he formulated the
algorithm context free grammar which is
part of most computer programming
languages as well as programs that
appear to understand language
he also
challenged traditional notions of
learning
public intellectual in the world job
skills
has been the same biographies has been
interviewed countless times in popular
media and has appeared in over 20 films
and documentaries
he has written more than 100 books his
most recently in different
concentrations of wealth and power
professor thompson's fame has extended
into popular culture leading success as
one of you two to describe him as elvis
of academia
professor of his facebook page has more
than 1.2 million followers you can
imagine his popularity and the
generations of the linguistics he brings
we are fortunate to have
got the opportunity to interact with one
of the most influential scholars and
top leaders of the patent world
this is the real-time village for all of
us to have
his
speaking
from our department so thank you
professor noah for being so generous to
be here i
do not want to go longer because i can i
cannot
i want to say anything in introduction
because we less than what you are as a
great
genius of this century so i will stop
the introduction i know the people know
you all if i'll go along the entire time
will uh spend i will spend introducing
yourself which even won't be sufficient
so with this brief introduction i'm
going to talk about the safety words
about the abstract office talk professor
nob chomsky will be speaking on the
human capacity language and how
paleo anthropologist alexander must want
that store the human capacity to denote
the elusive quality that makes humans so
distinctive when we inquire through this
illusive quality we find two striking
properties language and thoughts
and this
comes in any way we can grasp and get a
story
a plausible conclusion that is that they
are identical language is a system for
generating thought and thought is what
is generated by language
that is the answer
that
resonates through intellectual history
until the 20th century and has been
disrupted in the generative enterprise
and independently in the study of human
evolution
so he will be talking on these lines so
with his brief introduction and about
his topic i would like to request i
would like to welcome
our professor
he will speak on the human capacity
language and thought thank you thank you
all and to professor nom chomsky
thank you very much
uh
a good place
to begin is at the beginning
that's twenty five hundred
years ago as
far back as detailed raven birds go
that's when the
priestess
at the delphic oracle
issued a pronouncement
defining our primary task
no release help
well the two-word aphorism
can be interpreted in many ways
uh given
what we now know today
and what should be over most in our
minds
a reasonable way to interpret
the oracle is in collective terms
as urgent advice
to try to understand
what kind of creatures we are
and we are indeed strange beasts
that once the
pride of the
of evolutionary history
the same time
the scourge of the earth
is challenged to find out how this could
be and an imperative to find out in time
so that we can
send off the worst and
aspire to the best
humans
very recently in the evolutionary record
two to three hundred thousand years ago
to blink of an eye and evolutionary time
and not surprisingly
there's very little
diversity among humans
the
slight differences
are what matter for life
the commonalities
we take for granted
for understanding ourselves
the proper stance is the exact opposite
what is deeply important
and most revealing
is what is common to us
distinguishing humans
so radically
from other life on earth
variation is superficial
that much is true on
pure intellectual grounds
but also
in its import on human life
it's not news that
we are at a unique moment in human
history
a moment when
decisions have to be made
quickly and decisively
as to whether
human society
will persist
in any organized form
we're living at a moment of confluence
of severe crises
existential ones
all are collective
no boundaries
we will answer them together
or not at all
in which case
the human experiment
will come to an inglorious end
it's a critical topic
that you'll have to put aside
for lack of time
for good reasons then
we should interpret the advice of the
oracle
collectively
what kind of creatures are we
what are the species properties that are
common to humans
apart from severe pathology
and are without significant analog
elsewhere in the living world
even among their
closest relatives
the higher eggs
these are the properties that
paleoanthropologists
call
the human capacity
well when we inquire into this question
i think we find
two striking properties
that satisfy
this austere criterion
language and thought
at least thought
in any way that we can grasp and study
it's language and thought
that enable humans to issue the
proclamation of the oracle
to reflect on its meaning
to seek to find the answers to the
questions it awakens in our minds
and the same is true of the most
mundane experiences of ordinary human
life
all common to humans
but in important ways
distinctive to the human species
well if inquiry
reveals
two distinct properties
that virtually define the species
the next question is
what relation holds between them
the simplest answer
would be the relation of identity
language is a system
for generating thought
thought is what is generated by language
now that in fact is the answer
that was given
at about the same time as the oracle
in classical india
by the famous
sanskrit scholar
artrari
one of the founders of the great
tradition
of indian grammar and philosophy
in his conception
quoting
language is not the vehicle of meaning
or the conveyor of thought
but rather its generative principle
thought anchors language
that language anchors thought
using language's thinking
and thought that vibrates through
language
in classical greece
at roughly the same time
a similar answer
was given by
aristotle
he
distinguished abstract words from
spoken words
the spoken words
vary from language to language
in ways
that he found of little interest
the former
the abstract words are the symbols of
mental experience
which is the same for all
these are the basic components of
propositional thought
of affirmation and denial
based on subject and predication
resonate through intellectual history
on to the
16th century
the spanish
physician philosopher
juan jorge
set the stage for the first cognitive
revolution which followed shortly after
he emphasized
what he called
the generative quality
of human understanding
unique to humans
the capacity that we constantly exercise
in normal life
and using language
to construct new thoughts
to interpret
those of others
partners also identified
a still higher form of intelligence
a form that enables
some
to create work of true intellectual and
aesthetic value
of the rest of us
lacking this talent
are at least able to enjoy and
appreciate it
sometimes carry it forward
another species property
that derives from the
language thought complex
forte also insisted
on the universality of language
structure
on the
brain for cognitive functions
and on the innateness of
functions
along with the
generative quality of human
understanding
these ideas have been revived
without any awareness of the long
forgotten history
in what is called the
cognitive revolution
of the 1950s
was a sharp break
from the then prevailing
structuralist behaviorist doctrines
these ideas flourished during the 17th
century
scientific revolution
which led to the basis for modern
science
a core part
of this revolution
was the willingness
to be puzzled about simple things
ordinarily just taken for granted
so why do rocks fall to the earth
while steam rises
why do we see a
certain visual presentation
as a triangle
scientists of the
17th century were not satisfied
with what they called the
occult ideas
that were invoked
to account for what happens in the world
they wanted to focus on
simple
phenomena
and find explanations for them
just as children do
with their incessant why questions
that's the stance that has always driven
under understanding forward
language did not escape
their attention
galileo
contemporaries
expressed their awe and wonder
about a truly remarkable fact
with a few symbols
each
of us can construct infinitely many
thoughts in our minds
we can even convey to others
who have no access to our minds
their most innermost workings
for descartes
this normal
creative use of language
employing this capacity
was
a foundation
for his postulating a
second substance
race kogi dance
thinking substance
relating language and thought
a substance unique to humans in
his metaphysics
galileo himself
regarded the alphabet
as the most spectacular
of human inventions
because it captured this marvel
galileo's amazement was echoed
years later
by god luck fraga
the founder of modern logic
modern philosophy logical philosophy
frey fragrant
quoting him
found astonishing
what language accomplishes
with a few syllables
it expresses a countless number of
thoughts
and even for a thought
grasped for the first time
it provides a clothing
in which it can be recognized by another
to whom it is also entirely new
the amazement of these
great thinkers
is entirely warranted
as is their insistence
on puzzlement
over what seems self-evident
the insight
poses
what we might call the
galilean challenge
how is this achievement possible
the challenge seems to me to
capture lucidly
the major task
faced by the inquiry
into the nature of language and thought
and
into the unique nature of the human
species
the galilean challenge
a rich tradition
of what was called general and rational
grammar
general because it saw
universal principles
underlying human languages
rational
because it sought to go beyond
description
to explanation
throughout
language was generally regarded
as intimately bound to thought
the common understanding was captured
simply
in the 19th century linguists
william dwight whitney
in his phrase that language's horrible
thought
that we now recognize
that speech sound does not have that
unique status
any sensory
facility will
serve
the great humanist
founder of the modern research
university
wilhelm von humboldt
went further
identifying language with thought
he characterized language as a
generative activity
and pondered the fact that somehow this
activity
makes infinite use of finite means
a basic feature of the
galilean challenge
humboldt's formulation
of the galilean challenge
brings to light
a serious gap
in the entire tradition
it failed to accommodate
aristotle's crucial distinction
between
possession of knowledge
and use of knowledge
contemporary terms
competence and performance the tradition
kept
entirely to use of knowledge
more specifically
use of knowledge and production of
speech
little was said about perception of
speech
it's a prime concern of modern
psycholinguistics
both
production and perception
access
the knowledge that is internally
possessed
well appropriate means
we're not available
to formulate clearly
and to investigate
the fundamental task
to unearth the system of knowledge
exists
in general language
what is called by language
with modern technical usage
this gap was overcome
by the modern theory of computation
which was created by
alan turing
of the great
early 20th century mathematicians
and was adopted
in the modern reshaper
forgotten distinction
between position and use of knowledge
made it possible to launch
serious study
of possession of knowledge for the first
time
that does not entirely result resolve
humboldt's puzzle of drug production
but it makes it possible
to carve out the domain
of feasible inquiry
the study of the generation of the
knowledge possessed
with finite means
an infinite scope
production of law of language
like other creative action
is beyond the reach of inquiry
in any fundamental sense
as is even
simple voluntary action
the distinction
between
generation and production of language
is fundamental
and commonly misunderstood
generation
lays out the terrain
here are the linguistically formulated
thoughts
production is an activity
which makes use of these thoughts
commonly in
innovative and
creative ways
that are not understood
in quartation terms
our use of
is
appropriate
to circumstances
but not caused by them
[Music]
[Music]
muted
your microphone has got muted please
unmute yours
your mic is muted
you connect
okay sorry
well let me just go back a little
uh the distinction between
generation
and production of language
is fundamental
commonly misunderstood
generation
basically
lays out the terrain
it is here are the
thoughts that are linguistically
formulated
production
is different it's an activity
that makes use of these thoughts
commonly does so in
innovative creative ways
ways that are not understood
in the
standard terms of
carticarki
oh
the
new tools of computation
made it possible for the first time
to develop
explanatory theories
of language
theories that yield an
infinite array of
hierarchically structured expressions
that constitute thought
that can be externalized in some
sensory motor
medium usually sound
that's what we call the basic property
of language
as soon as this
enterprise was undertaken
problems arose
the reigning
structural behaviorist consensus
had no real presence
everything essential was known
procedures of analysis
could be applied to any corpus of
materials
as soon as the search for explanation
began
it turned out that almost nothing was
known
virtually every sentence
poses new puzzles
furthermore the elements that are
postulated in the best theories
could not possibly be found
by a series of procedures
just as in every other branch of science
the driving force in inquiry is
imagination
conjecture
there's no algorithm for that
what's needed is the willingness to
challenge established doctrine
better
ideas
explanation in the language case
has to proceed at two levels
a generative graph
of a language
is a theory
that tries to explain its properties
the knowledge that's possessed by the
language user
at a deeper level
the theory of the shared language
faculty
is concerned
with the innate factors
that make language acquisition possible
the factors that distinguish humans from
all other organisms
modern terms that's called
universal grammar ug
it's adapting a traditional term
to a new framework
well ug has goals
that appear contradictory
it must meet
at least
three conditions
first
ug must be rich enough
to overcome
what's called the problem of
poverty of stimulus
that is the fact that what is acquired
demand
lies far beyond any evidence of
available
second problem
ug must be simple enough
to have evolved
under the conditions of human evolution
third
ug must be the same
for all possible languages
given the fact there's no biological
adaptation
to specific languages
well we achieve a
genuine explanation
of some linguistic phenomena
only if it keeps the mechanisms
that satisfy
the joint conditions
of learnability
evolvability
and universality
which appear to be at odds
the course of theoretical inquiry
has been driven by the goal
of reconciling
these conflicting requirements
these problems were
evident
at the outset of the
generative enterprise mid-20th century
we now know that they are considerably
more severe
than
what was assumed at the time
uh with regard to
evolvability
uh genetic studies
have shown
that humans began to separate
not long after their appearance at least
150 000 years ago
there are no known differences in
language faculty
so it must
already have been in place
furthermore there's no
meaningful evidence of
any symbolic activity
prior to the emergence of homo sapiens
well these facts suggest
that language emerged
pretty much along with modern humans
if so
we would expect
that the basic structure of language
should be quite simple
the result of some
relatively small
rewiring of the brain
that took place once
and has not changed in the brief period
since
the apparent peer problem
the apparent contradiction with
learnability
therefore becomes more severe
research on language acquisition
has extended the dilemma further
it's shown that a
child of two or three years old
has already mastered basic properties of
its language
including some
quite remarkable ones
does not exhibit this
knowledge but
experimentals that it has
furthermore
statistical study
of the data available to the child
shows that relevant evidence is
very sparse
these discoveries seem to require
that ug be
rich enough
in order to
overcome the enormous gap between
data available and knowledge attained
while the evolvability condition
demands the opposite
that ug be very restricted
and the problem of
endless
variation apparently endless variation
that lurks in the background
that's the conundrum
in the past
few years
some hope has finally emerged
to resolve this type of dilemmas
within
what's been called the minimalist
program
we can see how by looking at a
fundamental
and quite puzzling
universal property of language
problem the property called
structure dependence
to just
think about a very simple sentence
and its properties
which are mastered by
two-year-old children as experiments as
shown
to take the sentence
the boy and the girl
are in the room
notice notices are in the room
not is in the room
see that racist puzzles
the determined agreement
the child does not use the simplest
computational rule adjacency
rather the child reflexively relies
on something it never hears
the structure that its mind creates
the child then assigns
plurality
by virtue of the nature
of this abstract structure
the coordination
that problem quickly extends
to much more complex cases so take the
sentences
the bombing of the cities
was a crime
the bombings
of the city
were crimes
well to decide
whether to use
was or were singular or plural
we ignore
linear adjacency
we attend
only to the structure
a full non-phrase subject
but we have to go beyond that
to find the central element of the noun
phrase
bombing or bombings
far more complex computation then
linear adjacency
would be reflexively ignored
let's take it a step further
consider the sentence
the mechanic
who fixed the core carefully packed his
tools
is ambiguous
did he fix the core carefully
or did he carefully pack the tools
well now put the adverb carefully in
front of the sentence
carefully
the mechanic who fixed the core
packed his tools
so unambiguous
it means that he carefully practiced
tools
the adverb carefully
seeks a verb
but it cannot use the simplest
computation
find the nearly closest verb
it has to
eugene forces us
to ignore
that simple computation
and to select the more revoked verb
which happens to be the structurally
closest verb
as you see when you assign the structure
that our mind
tells us is the correct way
well goes without saying that none of
this can possibly be learned
so we therefore have a puzzle
the infant ignores
100
of what it hears
linear order
and attends only
to what it never hears
what its mind constructs
furthermore this is true
of all constructions in all languages
the only possible answer is that linear
order is simply not available to the
child
who is acquiring the system
that constructs thought
so why then does speech require
linearization
well the reason is obvious
the articulatory system
cannot produce structures
so the externalization process
must impose
linear order
on an internal system of generation of
thoughts which has no word
sign language
is less strictly linear
because of wider options that are
available
in visual space all the sensory motor
systems that are used for
externalization
have nothing at all to do with language
they were in place long before language
emerged they have not
changed true language is the internal
system
that generates thoughts
internal to an individual
coded as a recursive general process
somewhere somehow in the brain
so we now face the question
why does the language does the infant
reflexively ignore
100
of what it hears
why does it ignore
100 of what it hears
linear order
and attend only to what it never hears
abstract structures conducted by the
constructed by the mind
there is a straightforward answer
satisfaction of the basic property
requires a computational procedure
the simplest computational procedure
is what's called
binary set formation
called merge and recent work and it's
very easy to show
that if recursive generation is based on
merge
then structure dependence is
automatically imposed
and there's no linear order there are
many consequences
one consequence
is that certain thoughts become
inexpressible in speech
even very simple ones
to illustrate
shift from
conjunction
to disjunction
take the sentences
either john or mary
is in the room
either the boys
the girls or the boys are in the room
both fine
how about
either the girls or john
is in the room
no good
either the boys or john or in the room
no good
neither is possible
the thought is very clear
and if number agreement were based on
adjacency
easily expressed
but with structured abundance
the thought is inexpressible
in the simplest way
you have to produce some
complex paraphrase
this is one of
a great many examples of conflict
between
optimal design
and utility for communication
there are many others that are far more
serious than this one
they're always resolved in the same way
communicative efficiency
is always sacrificed
to put it metaphorically
when mother nature was constructing
language she was concerned
with optimal design
not with how the system might be used
if it turns out to be dysfunctional
so be it
it's worth noting that that's how
evolution works quite generally
we can distinguish
three steps
in
normal evolutionary change
the first step is
innovative
some disruption takes place
maybe a mutation
maybe a bacterium
accidentally swallows some other
microorganism
which would lead to eukaryotic cells
complex sills
the basis for complex life just an
accident
the disruption
introduces something new
then comes the second step
reconstruction
nature
redesigns the system
in the simplest way
satisfying natural law
and comes the third and final step
winnowing natural selection
reduces the variety
to the better adapted
the simplest solution
produced at the second step
might be dysfunctional
but nature doesn't care
and reconstruction
nature
seeks optimal design
it has no way to consider possible
functions
that's the general story about evolution
well language
seems to fit the normal pattern
so we can
envision an
evolutionary scenario that looks
something like this
some
small rewiring of the brain
yielded the
property the general property of
recursive generation
nature then took
the usual course of seeking the simplest
such operation
relied on natural law
in this case
principles of computational efficiency
the result is a system based on merge
which satisfies the basic property
its deepest
most surprising property
structure dependence
follows at once
with its ramified consequences
ug encodes the outcome
the infant therefore
reflexively ignores
everything it hears
and attends only to the abstract
structures its mind creates
fleshed out us thoughts
will in these terms
we can envy
[Music]
the diversity condition the third
condition
can be put to the side
in the study of the core system of
generation of thought
the variety of languages might be
localized
largely in
peripheral aspects of the lexicon
and externalization
perhaps completely
we may some
time learn
pretty much
aristotle's figure picture
research
seems to me to be tending in that
direction
would be a natural outcome the
property of stimulus
conditions on the core system are severe
sometimes clearly unsurmountable
as in the case of
structured abundance
furthermore the
sensory motor
eye language amalgam
poses a cognitive problem that can be
solved in many ways would not be at all
surprising to find
that it is the locus
of the complexity
the mutability of language
along with a variety
all superficial
if these ideas
are on the right track
again that happens to be the classical
conception from
2500 years ago
well if that's right
at least for eye language the conundrum
conundrum is largely reduced
to satisfy
the evolvability condition
that problem will be overcome
to the extent
that the structures of i language are
generated by the simplest operations
what's called the strong minimalist
theory of thesis
set outcome
as a prime goal of the theory of
language
that
interesting progress has been made
towards that goal
just in the last few years
notice that these
observations
reinforce the traditional view
that language is essentially a system of
thought
the modern doctrine that language is a
system of communication
that may have evolved from animal
communication
seems
quite untenable
well returning to the evolutionary
scenario
the winnowing stage
the stage of natural selection
may never have been reached
possibly because the system is so
tightly integrated
that it's
either all or none
that's increasingly what we find
when we investigate more complex cases
well instead of
going on to
further cases of genuine explanation
let's turn to how thoughts are fleshed
out
by language is a computational system
any such system
has primitive elements
atoms of computation
as computational procedures
to form new elements out of them
for language
the primitives or the minimum
meaning bearing elements
in an analytic language like english
so you have major books with
titles like
words and objects
w the equine
words and things roger brown
standard texts
philosophy of language and language
acquisition
for language generally
word is not the right concept
even for latin english if you look
closely but let's keep doing it anyway
it's close enough for english
these titles that i just quoted
reflect the standard view
that words are linked to mined external
objects
by the relation of reference
words refer to things in the world
for the sciences
establishing such a relation
is a norm
when scientists speak of
uranium or genes
or phonemes
they hope that there are such things
it also seems that
animal communication systems observe
this condition
with a one-to-one relation
between
signals say a call of a monkey and some
physically identifiable event but
there's good evidence that human
language does not observe
the referential doctrine
we use words to refer
that's an action
what the
eminent british philosopher john austin
called a speech act
but when we look closely at the meanings
of words it's very hard to sustain the
idea
that there's a word object relation
take a
standard example in philosophy language
supposedly logically proper name
say london
well i can perfectly well say
that i'm going to visit and again
after it was destroyed by fire
and rebuilt
50 miles
of the thames
with different materials and different
design
no one believes that there's a real
world entity with such properties as
these
the fact is that the word london is not
a proper name
it's rather a city name
and our mental
concept city has rich and complex
properties
carried over when we use the word london
in the speech act of referring
now that observation
generalizes to the whole vocabulary
the basic point recognized by aristotle
he discussed the word house
aristotle observes that it's an amalgam
of
matter and form
the material part is what a physicist
could identify
bricks timber so on
the form is a mental construction
the design
the intention of the architect
the characteristic use and so on
so something could look exactly like
the place where i'm speaking
my house
but it could actually be a library or it
could be a garage
or it could be a paperweight for a giant
these are not properties detectable by
physical examination
even earlier than aristotle
a similar point was made by
presocratic philosopher
heraclitus when he asked
how we can cross the same river twice
though its material component has
changed
it's a deep question
a little thought shows that under
radical material changes
it'll still be the same river
while under very slight changes it will
not be a river at all
maybe a canal
maybe even a highway if the surface is
hardened and it's used for commuting
that turns out to be true of even the
simplest words that we use to refer
what can be detected by observation
tells you little
about the meaning of words
while these features of language and
thought
raise new conundrums
all of this
[Music]
must be not about learning there's no
evidence for it
correspondingly
must be
shared
cross-linguistically in all languages
in fundamental respects
just as aristotle
assumed studies of language acquisition
have shown
that these items are acquired
on very few presentations
two or three
that implies that there may stun rich in
a strict substructure
what we call learning
is apparently a matter of
setting
relatively superficial properties
there are no analogs to such concepts
in all
existence
there's no record of their development
well here
we begin to reach the borders of
understanding
in recent years
there have been many striking
achievements
they open up new challenges
and new mysteries
it's not an uncommon feature of
scientific inquiry
endlessly fascinating
thank you
thank you thank you so much
for
you for the wonderful
talk
that we have delivered
uh i would like to include
best
diaz again uh for taking up the few
questions from the audience
and
thank you professor
thank you professor chomsky
for your invite insightful and
illuminating lecture
it was a pleasure pleasure listening to
you sir
a living legend
your presence has greatly enriched the
department of linguistics at emu
in fact i had a chance of listening to
your lecture way back in 1996
when you had come to delhi after a gap
of over 25 years
and that was on language and mind which
had generated an unprecedented
excitement among the academic community
i can see a similar excitement by the
number of participants
who wish to interact with you
however we are constrained not to
entertain all the questions
i will come with few questions i
understand
we are
short of time and we also have
considerations for the the conditions
that we have right now regarding
your
sustained lecture for such a long time
and i do not know how much would be able
to really take many questions
but we can assure the audience
that
the questions will be sent to you and
should you wish to respond to them at a
later stage they'll be most happy to
have your responses to their questions
which remain unanswered so with these
words i come to
specific questions that have been raised
here
the questions
there are some questions that will come
from the audience directly
i would request them to raise their if
and will take some from from those
questions
the question is that what do you mean by
the concept of competence and
in what ways do you think these
i'm sorry the questions are these
concepts have been applied in language
teaching
um
well confidence
and form of
just the modern
group
for aristotle's
distinction between
possession of knowledge
and use of knowledge
those are two different things
we
possess
knowledge of arithmetic
but
we use our knowledge of arithmetic when
we
solve the
equation or simply multiply numbers
but these are very different things
in our heads our knowledge of arithmetic
provides the answer
to every computation
if i take two large numbers say
491
8672
and multiply them
the internal knowledge my internal
knowledge gives an answer to
i can't do it
i can't produce that answer
without paper and pencil and a lot of
extra memory
that's use of knowledge
the internal knowledge is
the rules of arithmetic just yield all
the knowledge there is it's inside
coded in their heads
but to use the knowledge is a very
different thing and it's the same with
language
so my internal knowledge of english
yields an
infinite number of
complex sentences
i can use this knowledge somehow
incidentally nobody knows how
how you decide to pick out
a sentence from the infinite array in
your head
and decide to use it nobody knows
and well i can use it in some ways
shakespeare could use it in ways that
were far more
aesthetically
and intellectually significant
i can't do that i
wish did what he did at that capacity
but not the capacity to produce it
well these are all
various aspects of performance
very little is understood about
performance it's mysterious
that's true even of the simplest actions
trying to explain why i can
lift my finger let's say
nobody understands that either
why do i decide to do it this way not
that way for example
there are no answers to that in
neurophysiology
and certainly for the more complex
questions of use of languages or total
mystery
let alone what part they call the higher
form of intelligence
the use of language inward
aesthetically and intellectually
significant ways
well all of these are aspects of
performance
almost total mystery for us
competence the internal system
knowledge of arithmetic
knowledge of language
that poses many very serious
complex issues but in that domain we can
make progress and have made a problem
question also asked
how you can use this in language
teaching
that's a different problem
language teaching like any kind of
teaching
is about
95
motivation
if
anybody who's a teacher of children or
graduate students knows this
if the student is motivated
they want to learn
they can learn doesn't matter what
method you use if they're better or
worse ones but the main problems is just
make it interesting
the rouse motivation curiosity
too much of education
is the opposite
it kills curiosity
it dulls
interest and motivation
you know that's the wrong way
the right way is to cultivate
interest and motivation
the natural interest that everyone has
from
an infant on through adulthood to try to
understand
so
cultivate that
that teaching will work
thank you very much this is the question
that's there from
how generative generalizations of
minimalist grammar help language
acquisition
how does it help language requisite
it's a little bit
like asking a
biologist
when you study
the nature
organism
how does that help
train
an olympic champion
not directly
a trainer
of an olympic champion
would do better if they know something
about physiology and anatomy
but they're not going to get the answers
there
these are
practical applications of fundamental
knowledge
it's quite interesting if you look at
the history of science
until quite recently
biology had very little to tell the
medicine
the last century was actually the first
time
with the destruction
the development of antibiotics and so on
that
biology has much to tell to
medicine by now it has a lot to tell
so if you go to medical school today
you're going to learn fundamental
biology because now it has something to
contribute
but for millennia
had almost nothing to contribute
it was a it was an art medicine was an
art that you somehow acquired
that's even true in engineering
i'll just tell you my own experience
i got mit where i spent most my life as
the
world's leading
engineering science university
when i got there in 1955
it was an engineering school
you taught students how to build things
there were
great science and math departments but
they were service departments
who were providing tricks for the
engineers
ten years later it was a science-based
university
engineering was unemployed
if you wanted whether you wanted to be
an aeronautical engineer mechanical
engineer or whatever
you had to study the same basic science
because for the first
district
the sciences had reached the point
where they were really telling you
something fundamental
about engineering practice
if you wanted to carry out engineering
practice you better understand the
sciences
well
those are recent developments in the
most fundamental sciences
in things like my study of
humans
we're far from that so if you're
learning enough there's still a huge gap
between
what's understood about the nature of
humans and ways to apply this in
the art of
managing raising children so on
so this is another question as for
universal grammar all languages are
essentially the same in terms of grammar
how can this be tested
how can it be tested yes sir belong can
be tested by
detailed close investigation
of a wide variety
of typologically
varied languages
which is exactly what's been done
for the last roughly 50 years
soon as the earliest
work in the generative enterprise began
immediately
it began to be applied to
widely varied languages
most in the early years most of this
work was at mit later spread around the
rest of the world
very far around so now it's everywhere
but in the
1960s it was mostly mit
nmit very quickly became
the world center for study of aboriginal
languages
australian aboriginal languages
native american languages
african languages
was mainly the work of a
great
uh scientist uh kenneth hale
died a few years ago an old friend close
friend came to mit
in the 1960s and opened up all these
studies
after that it spread all over the place
so that's and what's been found
is quite striking
so languages that look on the surface
to be radically different from one
another turn out to have the same
fundamental principles when you study
them in depth
uh more and more that's what we're
discovering
even with the most wildly different
languages and that's what you'd expect
to find
otherwise it would be impossible to
explain
how any child learns any language
remember no child is biologically
adapted to learning a particular
language
you take a language from someone
by
the amazon
that hasn't had human contact for 20
thousand years other human gone to
bring him to
cambridge massachusetts
they'll be just like any other child
there go to mit and study quantum
physics
and conversely
take a child from cambridge
massachusetts
raise them in
the depths of the amazon jungle
to learn
all of the remarkable skills and talents
that every
child there has
how to pick the right kind of fruit from
a tree and so on
very complicated
there's no adaptation
which means that we come the child comes
to language acquisition
with only the information that this is a
human language
that's built in
and on the basis of that
with very little evidence very little
the child becomes a fluent native
speaker of the particular language
well just from
the general nature of that phenomenon
you can conclude with
air confidence
that all languages are fundamentally the
same
that the differences lie in some
superficial things
like how you pronounce this word or hey
i pronounce that word
uh does the verb precede the object does
the object received the verb
and it turns out that that's what that's
what we're going to have to find
and more and more we're coming towards
that
very different from what was believed
during the structuralist period
that point mid 20th century
it was
universally assumed
that languages can vary
in almost any possible way
and each one has to be studied
in its own terms
when you don't understand any topic
that's the way it moves
it looks in its own total chaos
incidentally the same as current biology
and each one has to be studied on its
own
i don't know that's completely false
the constraints on possible organisms
are very rigid
there are very few possible organisms
there are what are called laws of form
that just determine what constitutes a
possible living organism
this has actually reached the point
where it's been suggested seriously
that there may be a universal genome
single genome for all of life
with minor variations grounded up but
that's not
proven but it's considered a plausible
thesis and i think we're writing the
same in language
and as a general point
you approach some
phenomena complicated phenomena
it looks unintelligible
take a look at leaves blowing in the
wind
possibly be laws of motion that's just
too chaotic
well
this is proved the opposite
when you look at the simple cases
your puzzle about how they work
you can find fundamental principles
which expand
some cases over the centuries
and finally giving you a
grasp of how the world works in some
areas other areas remain very mysterious
like production of language
thank you
in the light of language i language and
e-language
can we say that the cognitive
linguistics is up to finding
correspondences between these two
conceptual frames of language
well what's called
cognitive linguistics
is pretty obscure field in my opinion
uh
maybe you can
make more sense of it than i can
all of linguistics is concerned
with the question of
what's the nature of the internal
language
how does it manifest itself in
the external systems
what's the process of externalization
you have an internal system
probably the same for all languages
it
is it can be externalized in speech the
usual way
can be externalized and signed
the language of the deaf
about the same same processes
same internal structure
can even be done by touch
telekiller type example it's very hard
but possible
sensory motor systems have nothing to do
with language at all
as i said they were there
millions of years before language ever
appeared they haven't changed
the internal system maps onto those
external things
it's done in many different ways
that's where the
apparent variety of language
applies primarily
seems that the internal systems are the
same
personally i
cognitively there are there is
interesting work in what's called
cognitive linguistics
uh
there are columns work on
somatic properties for example is quite
illuminating
but the
general field itself
doesn't seem to me to have
coherent formulation it's my opinion
it's a
confused way of looking at the problems
we're all interested in
thank you professor chomsky there are
two very small queries one is is head
movement still phonological
and second order what does the lexicon
contain
that's the first one was about head
movement head movement still being sent
phonologically
well this is
a little bit technical so it's for those
of you who
know something about the field
of the the operation of head movement
like for raising a verb to
tense or something like that
raising a verb the second position
that is
very common to you
but it's unformulable
there is no way in any known
uh generative procedure to formulate
that rule
look at it closely you can see why
it violates the extension condition
if you raise a verb depends
it forms a unit
in which according to the rules the verb
is a joint of the tense
it can't be
the tense is a joint of the verb says it
exactly backwards and furthermore it
violates extension
so you can't formulate it
that makes it look like a phonological
rule
on the other hand there are arguments
against that
namely it seems to be cyclical
so
a substantive root and a joint to a
verbal element
that can adjoin to a tense
that can move on to the
basic
clause forming element complementizer
step-by-step
do that so it looks syntactic
so it was a real problem
we just have for the first time some
answers to this
in
actually
discussed in a paper that just came out
today it happens in japan
a paper of mine on
the
modern and minimalist theory which
offers an answer to how this could work
through
other
appears in the journal of the japanese
linguistic society if you have
internet connections
thank you
[Music]
uh
okay
all right couldn't grasp the question
could you repeat it
no it was not questions it was for
just uh i was requesting professor
jasmine to take last two questions for
you
because we have received
because i can't hear it
yeah
i will take the question answer two more
questions for you sir
okay i'll i'll just uh since we have a
time constraint professor chomsky and
i've been asked by the chairperson not
to take more than two questions so i'll
take up two questions one is what role
does cognition play in acquisition and
development of language
cognition
is a very broad term our intellectual
cognitive capacities
play all kinds of rules
in doing anything
so when a child is acquiring language
and first of all
it has to somehow it has a
huge problem of
what's called extracting signal from
noise
uh when
if you were to speak to me and
today whatever
your native language happens to be
to me it would just be noise i would
just hear a lot of noise i wouldn't hear
anything
well that's what a child just
hearing noise
it has to pick the signals out from the
noise
what's the language that what part of
this noise constantly
it's a huge problem
uh children do it reflexively no problem
they're just built to do it
to pick it out it's part of their nature
pick out what's the signal what's the
noise
to try to duplicate that
with the
mechanical
computational algorithms extremely
complex
but children do it instantaneously
just the way uh
a newborn lamb
knows instantaneously
how to nurse
what why does it pick that out of all
the possible things that could happen
well that's the way organisms work
they're designed to do particular things
incidentally i picked the lamb example
because
my wife happens to have sheep and we
just had new lambs but so i watched it
but
all of life is like that organisms are
specifically designed to do specific
particular things
and they can do them in ways that we can
try to understand but are quite complex
so in the case of language acquisition
from the beginning picking out the
signal from the noise
on to determining
what a word is what a sentence is
how you get the universal properties of
such as structure dependence all of this
involves cognitive processes
but
we're built to do it other organisms
can't do it
we can't do what they can do
i live in the desert
there are ants out in my backyard
that can carry out
cognitive feats
that vastly surpass anything that humans
can do
navigational feats
humans can only barely duplicate with
complex instruments
and they have brains so small you need a
microscope to see them
well that's the way they're designed
uh
we're all different in our own ways so
yes of course cognition enters in the
specific ways that we're designed to use
[Music]
i think
he lost his connections
and so
uh i can request like he is moderating
the question answer so
uh one more question to ask for
professor not just if he's not getting
connected
uh then
i am sorry will not uh take any more
questions i can see there are more than
50 60 questions
in the
chat box and we cannot entertain you
otherwise it will take two more hours
for professor nonsense to answer those
questions
i have to go off to another talk i'm
afraid okay yes sure that's what i'm
saying so may i request their request
did i request professor savannah
to
formally thanks uh professor dobchovsky
professor
please
thank you professor
good evening
good afternoon and good morning to
everyone present here from across the
globe in different time zones
it is such an honor for me to get this
opportunity to propose a word of thanks
to the distinguished speaker and all the
participants in today's lecture
i personally
at behalf of the department of
linguistics amiga muslim university
would like to express a heartfelt
gratitude to professor norm chomsky for
this highly enlightening address on the
topic human capacity language and
thought emphasizing intricacies
involving thought and language that have
association with some kind of mental
organization which is unique to humans
this day will go down in the history of
this university as one of the most
cherished as today a thinker part
excellence and academician of the
caliber and status of professor chomsky
was amongst us and became a part of this
great seat of learning it is indeed a
red letter day for this university and
for all of us
thank you professor chomsky for taking
time out for us from your extremely busy
schedule
it was indeed an enriching experience
listening to your insightful and
thought-provoking lecture
we are extremely grateful to the
honorable vice chancellor of
university professor parikh mansoor for
his unflinching support for today's
program and all our academic endeavors
sir with your support and guidance the
department successfully series of a
lectures by eminent scholars from
diverse fields of linguistics including
today's address by a stalwart like
professor chum's
it is indeed my pleasant duty to show
our gratitude to the registrar of the
university mr abdul hamid ips for his
support and for always coming forward to
help the department in its various
activities
we would like to extend our thanks to
the dean faculty of arts professor sahir
mohammed
has been there whenever we need him and
for helping us organize this lecture
the chairman department of linguistics
professor

organizing lectures and webinars for the
benefit of students and faculty
his contributions
in the department is praiseworthy and
will go a long way in taking the
department to new heights
i will fail in my duty if i do not
propose a hearty vote of thanks to all
the participants who graced the occasion
and will lie with us today their
presence in
us speaks volumes for the intellectual
depth scholarly content and academic
value of today's event
we are also thankful to our senior
colleague professor intiya susana for
moderating today's event
his handling of the proceedings has only
added to the academic essence of this
evening
it is indeed a pleasure to extend a
heartfelt thanks to all the organizing
committee members and members in the
department without whose active
participation this wonderful event would
not have been possible
last but not the least we specially
thank the non-teaching support staff of
the department of linguistics for their
untiring efforts and for providing
technical help in bridging distances and
connecting us globally on one platform
thank you all once again thank you
professor chomsky
thank you thank you all
as chair of the department i would like
to
thank professor nam chomsky it is really
a privilege
