professor Chomsky it's a real privilege
to be able to hear you talk and I just
like to thank you for shaping and
continuing to shape the way that I view
the world my question relates to what
you've written and spoken about quite
extensively that the two dominant
threats that's posed to humans survival
climate change and nuclear war
I was just wondering to what extent
you've considered a third possibility
which perhaps is maybe not quite so
obvious the threat of digital companies
of digital or companies mainly working
in this places like Silicon Valley
working quite secretively on stuff like
the singularity theorem and the Internet
of Things which are purported to create
a kind of super intelligence that will
render human humanity fairly obsolete I
was just wondering what your thoughts
were on that and whether in fact it's a
bad thing at all well so what about the
development of supercomputers there will
be more intelligent than humans
singularity you know think over
everything will be superfluous and so on
okay I've been listening to the I've
been at MIT for 60 years since 1950 I've
been listening to this for 60 years the
line has always been in six months we
will have computers which will do XY and
Z we don't have there's a famous paper
by Alan Turing called how mushy
how to make machines think or something
title like that short paper 8 pages
around 1950 it's the basis for all of
this work on what's called the Turing
test trying to develop machines which
will think you know a machine that'll
defeat a grandmaster and chess you know
win a prize in a television program and
so on all of this work and you can win
$100,000 if you develop what they call a
machine a machine means a program and
it's not the machine if you develop a
program that will pass the so-called
Turing test you know full of human and
pull a jury of humans into thinking it's
a person not a machine all of this work
overlooks the brief sentence in Turing's
paper namely the questions whether
machines think is too meaningless to
deserve discussion okay he didn't bother
explaining it but it's pretty obvious I
mean you can develop what again it's
kind of sexy to talk about a machine but
remember a machine is just like in
itself that's kind of like a paperweight
doesn't do anything it's the program
that's doing something and the program
is just some kind of theory no
complicated theory so you can develop
theories that will do specific tasks
like its it was obvious in 1960 that if
he put enough time and energy into it
you could develop a program that would
win a chess game against a grandmaster
how by getting a hundred grandmasters to
sit around for years and years of
figuring on what to do in all possible
circumstances so on and so forth
program it and it'll do better than a
grandmaster if as a half an hour to
think of it the next move okay it's
completely uninteresting intellectually
of zero interest it's good for IBM and
they saw
a lot of computers that way but it has
no intellectual interest the same is
true of winning in a quiz show you know
you've lost a lot of data into the
machine it'll good better than a person
but getting a machine to do a program
again to do anything that's at all like
the creative activities that every
four-year-old child can carry out that's
quite different and I don't think
there's and we have any grasp even on
how to go ahead to do that so I think
one can have a fair degree of skepticism
about the PR on super intelligent
machines and singularity and so on
