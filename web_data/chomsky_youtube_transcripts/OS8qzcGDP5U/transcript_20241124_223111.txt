Welcome, friends, to another 
edition of Economic Update,  
this one at the beginning of a new year. So let 
me wish you all a happy, and a better, new year.  
The program, as you know, is about economics — 
about the income; the debts; the jobs we have,  
or don't — for ourselves, for our children. 
The economics of the world we live in. And  
I'm your host, Richard Wolff.
 
I want to begin by responding to  
questions many of you have sent to me, to comment 
about President-elect Joe Biden's economic team,  
and in particular the progressives that are 
said to be on the team and that are said to  
reflect the openness of Joe Biden to the 
progressive wing of the Democratic Party.  
Let me begin with some general comments here. 
 
First of all, the economic team contains a  
remarkable number of carryovers, or holdovers, 
if you like, from the Obama government that Mr.  
Biden served a few years back. It's as 
if the Democratic Party wants to suggest  
that Mr. Trump was a kind of aberration, a weird 
four-year interlude, and that now we're going to  
get back to normal, or we're going to get 
back to usual, or we're going to get back  
to business as it was before Mr. Trump. I find 
this frightening as a probability because it  
suggests that these folks don't understand 
that the policies followed before Mr. Trump  
played a major role in producing Mr. Trump and his 
electoral victory. Therefore, going back to them  
strikes me as having not learned the lesson 
these people claim they have learned. 
  
But let me turn to the progressives that are 
on the team. As best I can tell from my own  
knowledge, and I do know some of them, there 
are three: Heather Boucher, Jared Bernstein,  
and the new Secretary of the Treasury, Janet 
Yellen. It seems clear to me that Heather Boucher  
is the most progressive of those three, based 
on the work she has done, particularly around  
inequality. Jared Bernstein, associated with 
the Economic Policy Institute, is part of  
the progressive, sort of, Washington, D.C., 
establishment, and he has been a long time. 
  
Janet Yellen — I'm a little mystified 
why she's in that group. I can mention,  
on grounds of transparency, that she and I were 
students at Yale University, getting our PhDs at  
about the same time. I had the same curriculum 
she did; I had the same professors she did.  
I do know about her training because it was the 
same as my own. I was involved, when I was a  
graduate student, in the efforts to form a new 
economics association. It was called the Union  
of Radical Political Economists. A whole group of 
us were active in starting that association. It  
is still in business, it produces its own journal, 
it runs its own section of the American Economics  
Association. Janet Yellen, as a graduate student 
and since, has had absolutely nothing to do with  
any of that. Because I would know, since I have 
been involved with that all of my adult life.
  
It was revealed a few days ago that since her time 
as head of the Federal Reserve a few years ago,  
she has been giving speeches. She has 
earned, apparently, in the neighborhood  
of $7-8 million giving those speeches. And 
they include, apparently, big, fat fees  
from the Goldman Sachs company — something 
that got Hillary Clinton into some difficulty,  
you may recall, a few years ago. Not usually part 
of the credentials of progressives, for all the  
reasons you don't need me to remind you about. 
 
So these three progressives are what you have.  
What they will do on the Council of Economic 
Advisers, or as the Secretary of the Treasury,  
is an open question. Are they sensitive to 
issues of inequality? Absolutely. They say so,  
and I take them at their word. But these 
are also people who have never gone  
outside the consensus of Washington, D.C. And 
what does that mean? It means they do not question  
capitalism — ever. They do not raise the issue 
that maybe some of the problems of inequality  
have to do with the way capitalist enterprises are 
organized. You know, with a tiny group of people  
at the top — the major shareholders, the board of 
directors, the CEO — making all the key decisions,  
and resulting in (what a big surprise) giving the 
bulk of the money to themselves, in dividends,  
in huge salaries for the top executives. Isn't 
that a part of the problem? Well, you won't hear  
that from them. At least you never have before. 
 
Could they change? Absolutely. Could they become  
open to it? For sure. After all, Roosevelt 
became open, and he was a middle-of-the-road  
fellow just like them back in the ‘30s. 
But there was this difference in the 1930s:  
a massive movement from below. The CIO, the 
biggest unionization drive in American history,  
two socialist parties, and a communist party — all 
working together. That's what made the New Deal.  
That's what made a politician, middle 
of the road like Franklin Roosevelt,  
become a champion of real progressivism. 
It could happen again, but that will have  
to depend on whether a movement from 
below develops. It will not depend  
on these folks in the Biden economic team.
 
My next update is a kind of respect  
I want to pay to an enormously important 
development in Argentina in recent weeks.  
The Argentine Senate was under enormous pressure 
from a massive movement of the Argentinian people,  
led by the women of Argentina, who have been 
fighting this fight for a good six or seven  
years — and probably longer, but six or seven 
years in the public eye. The women assembled  
a powerful coalition,including many labor unions 
and many radical social movements. They put them  
all together, and what did they achieve? They 
defeated the government on a central issue:  
the right to an abortion if a woman wishes to 
choose that way of dealing with her own body. 
  
The government opposed them. The Roman Catholic 
Church — the dominant religious institution  
in that country — opposed them. They defeated 
the government. And they defeated the church,  
which went to extraordinary lengths, partly 
because the current pope comes from Argentina,  
as some of you may know. And the 
church went all out, and it lost. 
  
And what's the significance? A mass mobilization 
from below — the very kind of mobilization  
I mentioned a few moments ago as making it 
possible that there might be a progressive Biden  
administration, because otherwise there won't be 
and there isn't one now — that kind of a movement  
that I talked about hypothetically in the United 
States is already a reality in Argentina. They  
got the senate, to the surprise of many, to vote 
in favor. All women in Argentina will now be able  
legally to acquire an abortion up 
until the 14th week of a pregnancy.
  
Before this action in Argentina — one of 
the largest and most important economies  
in all of Latin America — only very small parts 
of Latin America had legalized abortion: Cuba,  
of course; Uruguay; Guyana; and 
some parts of Mexico — that's it.  
All the other main parts of Latin America 
were steadfastly in the control of governments  
and the Roman Catholic Church on the 
question of abortion. Already there are signs  
that in both Chile and Brazil — large Latin 
American countries like Argentina — the women's  
movements there have taken an enormous inspiration 
to take the same steps in their countries. Things  
are changing south of the border, and they 
will not be limited to questions of abortion.  
They will go far beyond that, to the rest of the 
social issues burning in that part of the world.
  
My next update for today has to do with another 
question many of you have written to us about.  
This is the disconnect that now exists between 
what is going on in the stock market — the place  
where the richest of our rich people hold their 
wealth — and the economic realities facing  
the rest of us. It is a stark difference, as 
many of you know simply from looking around the  
communities where you live, where you work, and 
where you shop. An analyst at Nomura Securities  
in New York recently put his finger on it. He 
says the stock market in New York City is, quote,  
“foaming at the mouth.” Well, another 
way of saying that is it's crazy. 
  
But you know, in its craziness it reflects a 
truth. And that truth is the growing distance  
of the one to five percent of people rich enough 
to care about what's going on in the stock  
market — and that's all it is. The majority of 
people have no stocks. The minority who have them  
don't have enough to make much of a difference 
in their life. (The 11 shares you inherited when  
Grandma passed is not making you a player in the 
stock market.) The core of people, very small,  
who control the bulk of the shares — 10 
percent of shareholders own 80 percent of  
the shares — they're the ones doing real well.
 
And let's give credit where credit is due. The  
government of this country — which is in service 
of this one to five percent at the top — the  
government has decided to deal with the depression 
we're in economically, with the COVID-19 collapse  
on top of it, by pumping money into the economy to 
beat the band. The Federal Reserve has pumped in  
many trillions of dollars. The Treasury has been 
spending money it doesn't have, by borrowing, and  
that ultimately comes from the Federal Reserve as 
well. So we have all this money being created. 
  
Because the mass of people are poor in America 
now, and can't borrow, that money doesn't go in to  
produce more goods and services, and hire people 
to produce them, because the people of America  
can't buy this stuff. Millions are unemployed, and 
everybody else is scared to death. So where does  
the money go if it doesn't go into producing goods 
and services since the demand isn't there? It  
goes into the stock market, where it bids up the 
price of stocks — which is what the rich people  
are happy about because it makes them richer 
still. That's why the billionaires in America  
amassed another $2 trillion while the rest of 
us were struggling with the COVID-19 disaster.
  
It is a society ripped apart by its inequality. 
That's a story that never ends well, when a  
society makes the rich richer while impoverishing 
the mass of people. We're on that road,  
and Mr. Biden better get us off, or else 
we will have another Trump before long.  
Look, the crises of this society are 
multiplying. It's a period of decline,  
unless mass action turns it around.
 
We've come to the end of the first  
part of today's show. Before we move on, 
I want to remind you about our new book,  
The Sickness Is the System: When Capitalism 
Fails to Save Us From Pandemics or Itself.  
Go to democracyatwork.info/books to learn more or 
to get your copy. I want also to thank our Patreon  
community for their invaluable support. And if you 
haven't already, go to patreon.com/economicupdate  
to learn more about how you can get involved. 
And now it is my pleasure to urge you not only  
to stay with us because we'll be right back, 
but to let you know that our guest today,  
who really needs no introduction, is Noam Chomsky, 
talking about where we are and where we're going.  
Stay with us; we'll be right back.
 
WOLFF:  
Welcome back, friends, to the second half 
of today's Economic Update. I am really and  
genuinely honored and pleased to be able to 
welcome to our microphones and our cameras  
Professor Noam Chomsky. Noam Chomsky 
is Institute Professor Emeritus in  
the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.  
He is also the Laureate Professor of Linguistics 
in the Program in Environment and Social Justice  
at the University of Arizona. His work is widely 
credited with having revolutionized the field  
of modern linguistics. He is also the author 
of numerous best-selling political works,  
which have been translated into literally 
scores of languages around the world. He has  
a new book, released in January of 2021, called 
Consequences of Capitalism. Thank you very much,  
Noam Chomsky, for joining us. 
 
CHOMSKY: Glad to be with you.
  
WOLFF: Good. Let me start off with the question 
I know many of our viewers and listeners have:  
What difference do you think the new Biden 
administration will make in the basics  
of American domestic and foreign policy? 
With a particular addition: Do you think  
that the Trump years, now ended, will be seen as 
a kind of temporary aberration, an interruption,  
or is it more logically a part of an 
evolving American position in the world?
  
CHOMSKY: As far as Biden is concerned, I think 
the answer to the question will depend on the  
level of popular activism that works to press 
him towards a more, somewhat more, progressive,  
social-democratic stand. If he's left, if 
there isn't that pressure, he'll revert to the  
Clintonite, DNC, Wall Street-oriented, neoliberal 
programs of the past 40 years. But with pressure,  
he could change. And it's critical, especially 
on truly existential issues, like global warming,  
for example. We can't delay on doing something 
about that or everything else is essentially  
moot. He could be pressed, but it'll have 
to be pressed. It won't happen by itself.
  
As far as Trump is concerned, I don't think 
he's going away. He won't be sitting in the  
White House, but he'll be basically, I presume, 
trying to run kind of an alternative government,  
in combination with Mitch McConnell, the 
real evil genius of the Trump administration,  
whose goal very likely will be to try to make 
the country ungovernable, the way McConnell  
openly and proudly tried to do with Obama — make 
sure that the serious problems can't be dealt  
with properly. There'll be chaos, and they can 
blame it on the government, probably try to roar  
back into power. Trump himself has the voting 
base of the Republican Party in his pocket. A  
large majority of Republican voters say he's their 
savior, he's the future of the Republican Party. 
  
I don't think this is going to disappear. 
It has deep roots, many deep roots. It's not  
unique to the United States. The same, 
similar kinds of anger, resentment,  
contempt for institutions are taking place 
in every country where the neoliberal assault  
of the past 40 years has operated, severely 
damaging the general population, causing enormous  
inequality, undermining democracy, leaving 
people angry and frustrated. It's taken many  
forms. In the United States it’s combined with 
underlying — Trump was a genius at tapping the  
poisonous undercurrents of American society and 
culture, like white supremacy, crucially. He was  
able to bring them to the surface. They're not 
going away either. It's the form in which the  
resentment and anger — which are quite justified 
— about what's happened for the past 40  
years, the form in which it's being expressed. 
 
And we shouldn't overlook — well again,  
I was just going to say we shouldn't overlook 
how serious this is. You've probably talked  
on the program about the Rand Corporation 
study that came out a couple of weeks ago  
where they tried to estimate the transfer of 
wealth from the working class and the middle  
class — in their terms, the lower 90 percent of 
income level — transfer of wealth from them to the  
very top of the wealth ladder. That means 
the top fraction of one percent. But their  
estimate is about $47 trillion. Not small 
change. And that's a serious underestimate;  
doesn't take into account everything that 
happened after Reagan opened the spigot:  
tax havens, destruction of unions, and so on.
  
WOLFF: Let me continue this line with you for 
a moment, if I could. This kind of extreme  
inequality, which has been building, as 
you say, for 40 years or longer and is now  
almost accelerating, even though it has been 
going on for so long — that's a kind of story  
in human history that doesn't end real 
well. Do you think that the growing anger,  
bitterness, rage, envy, whatever you want to call 
it, will continue to be useful to the right wing  
more than it has been to the left in developing?
 
CHOMSKY: Well, I'm old enough to remember  
an earlier case of this, the 
early 1930s, my childhood,  
when something similar was happening. The 
system had broken down — very severe depression,  
much worse than now — and there were essentially 
two ways out. One way out was fascism,  
which, we should remember, reached its hideous 
peak in the most advanced country in the world,  
the country which was the peak of Western 
civilization in the sciences, the arts, regarded  
as the model of democracy: Germany. That became 
the depths of human history within a few years.
  
The other possible way out was social democracy, 
which happened in the United States under the New  
Deal, under tremendous popular activism 
and pressure. CIO organizing, militant  
labor actions, political activity, swung the 
balance. And it's a very delicate balance.  
So as far as your question is concerned, we're 
not in 1929, but there are some similarities,  
and it could go either way.
 
WOLFF: Any chance, in your view,  
of the Democratic and/or Republican parties 
being the place where any of this kind of  
left-wing alternative emerges (and I'm not asking 
you to predict), or does it need an independent,  
a third, a different kind of political party or 
formation to get it done? How do you see that  
question that is on so many people's minds now?
 
CHOMSKY: Well, as you know, of course, to form a  
viable third party under the highly regressive US 
political system is extremely difficult. It's not  
out of the question. It should be attempted. 
Tony Mazzocchi’s efforts at a labor party — great  
labor organizer and environmentalist, Tony 
Mazzocchi, back in the ‘90s — might have  
gotten somewhere. It could be revived now. It's 
going to require a revival of the labor movement.  
That's going to be crucial for it. 
 
The other possibility is to  
try to move the Democratic Party a little towards 
the social-democratic side. What's called the left  
here is a strange notion. So Bernie Sanders is 
called a radical. His views are too extreme to be  
tolerated in the United States. What are his main 
views? Universal health care — can you think of a  
country in the world that doesn't have it?
 
WOLFF: Right.
  
CHOMSKY: Mexico . . .
 
WOLFF: . . . Canada . . .
  
CHOMSKY: . . . Europe — everybody 
has it. Free higher education:  
Mexico, Germany, Finland — almost everywhere. 
Those are considered too radical for Americans.  
One of the chief correspondents of the 
London Financial Times, Rana Foroohar,  
associate editor, very good journalist, 
commented sort of semi-jokingly  
that if Bernie Sanders was in Germany, he could 
be running on the Christian Democrat ticket,  
the right-wing party. That's what's called way 
too far to the left in the United States. So yes,  
a move towards moderate social democracy, a 
return to something of the New Deal style,  
would be a major step forward. But it's not 
left. It's a step towards moderate sanity.  
And that can be achieved, I think.
 
WOLFF: In the interest of the waning minutes  
that we have, I wanted to ask you a question 
about political strategy, theory, philosophy,  
since I know you have been concerned 
with that most of your life.  
The relationships between Marxism and anarchism, 
as impulses, as movements, as traditions, let's  
call them, have been on again, off again, allies, 
enemies, and everything in between. Do you see  
either of those traditions, or both of them, as 
playing an important role, now and in the future,  
in the situations you've just described?
 
CHOMSKY: The traditions yes, but the words,  
probably not. The United States is a very unusual 
country. We can't ignore the fact. It's a shame,  
should be overcome, but it's a fact. 
I don't know of any other country,  
except extreme right-wing dictatorships, where 
a person can't identify himself as a socialist.  
The term “socialism” in other countries is 
kind of like saying “I'm a Democrat” here. If  
you're a communist, you can run for a political 
office. Maybe people won’t like it, but in the  
United States these are terms of opprobrium. We 
have such a well functioning propaganda system  
that ideas that are normal in comparable countries 
are considered utterly beyond the pale here. So  
terminology is — you have to be careful with it. 
 
But the ideas, yes. I think most of the  
population, judging by attitude studies, 
pretty much supports these attitudes and views.  
Now, you maybe have to approach 
them with different terminology,  
but yes, you can. Take the common thread of 
left Marxist and anarchist thinking, that  
working people should control the work environment 
and the enterprises in which they work. That's an  
old American view, so common that it was the 
slogan of the Republican Party under Abraham  
Lincoln. It was the main driving force for the 
most effective radical movements in American  
history, the Knights of Labor, the populist 
movement of the late 19th century. I don't  
think that's very far below the surface, and I 
think that can be recovered. And that is the lead  
driving element in the left 
Marxist, anarchist tradition.
  
WOLFF: Noam Chomsky, I wish we had much more time. 
I am very grateful for the time you have given us.  
I know I speak for my audience, both the listeners 
and the viewers. Yours is a lifetime of commitment  
to something that a whole new generation is 
learning they want to commit to. And I want, on  
their behalf and for myself, to thank you for all 
that you have done, including being with us today.
