we are joined today by noam chomsky and
vijay prashad to talk about their book
the withdrawal
iraq libya afghanistan and the fragility
of u.s power it's re really clear
throughout the book that
the terms are set by the united states
the conversation is set by the united
states and the
military and economic interventions
serve as internal and external
discipline so they are externally
disciplining anybody who dares you know
break or deviate from any of the rules
set out at any moment and they're
internally disciplining you know allies
in other countries who generally follow
along but it's showing constantly the
might of the united states and what
happens if you
step a toe out of line
speaking to what you were saying with
the china threat
this has recently been in the news
because of nancy pelosi's visit to
taiwan and i'd like both of you to
comment on that but you also talk about
in the book um
about the way that china is trying to
create systems that
can meet or match or
um
in some way contest u.s power and that's
both economic um
with the um
belt and road initiative you talk about
the shanghai cooperation organization
china has been doing development in
africa and from what i've read in the
mainstream news
the line is the chinese don't mind
working with corrupt leaders so they're
fine
to you know build these um
infrastructure projects down there but
this seems like it gets to part of the
core of the idea of the china threat and
there has been in the last week or so
some escalating tensions can you talk
about
pelosi's visit to taiwan and more
generally
what is the threat from china is it an
alternative
global
banking system like the swift system is
it a way of checking u.s sanctions is it
a way of checking u.s military power can
you speak to that
well with regard to pelosi
this was a
very
reckless uh
act of
personal aggrandizement
obviously trying to
beef up her cv and
show that she can be as tough as the
craziest lunatic male that you can find
there was no other reason for it for 50
years there's been
a basic agreement about taiwan
it's called the one china policy
it's agreed that china's part of
taiwan's part of china
and that
china and the united states will stay in
a state of strategic ambiguity as it's
called
the tacitly agree that neither of them
will do anything to overthrow the
status quo by force
okay that's kept
for 50 years of
peace
few breaks um
very successful policy
uh in recent years the united states has
been
increasing provocations
which china responds to the same in this
case
pelosi's visit was a major provocation
china didn't shoot down our plane
as they could have they simply responded
by
a demonstration
that china can close off taiwan
blockaded
so that it will
uh they will strangle it it's just it's
a trading it's a rock in the ocean
lives on trade
uh china surrounds it with military
force it's stuck it'll collapse so china
carried out military maneuvers showing
that
they also
[Music]
impose some sanctions
on taiwan and
also breaks with the united states
simply to show we're not going to be
pushed around
the sanctions are
probably more serious than they look
so one of the things that china
uh
imposed was apparent we don't have all
details but it seems
that they imposed the ban on export of
sand to taiwan
well that doesn't sound like much until
you think for a minute
sand
taiwan's a rock
if they want to build something they
need concrete
concrete is based on sand
so china's saying well
you fool around we can
undercut your economy
very easily we don't have to invade
that's basically the message
now we have to recognize that the u.s
provocations go way beyond taiwan
uh the united states
recently has been running a huge naval
operation multinational naval operation
rim pakistan
with
all threatening china in the pacific
major
operations
the us's
established what it calls
a
sentinel states to encircle china
hostile states run by the united states
biden provided precision weapons which
hadn't been there before to be able to
target china
us nuclear submarines
have the capacity to destroy china and
affect the world
but
they're all surrounding it they there's
an agreement with australia which
one of australia's leading strategic
analysts called ben fernandez called the
sub-imperial country
which serves u.s power in the as a base
for u.s power in the region
there's a deal to provide
uh
the alka steel it's called provide
australia with nuclear submarines which
can
seriously threaten china and the south
china sea
claimed to be able to just sink its
fleet if they want to
monitor chinese operations there uh
the quad so it's called is uh
south korea
and
japan
no australia japan united states and
india india is a reluctant partner
doesn't want to participate in this game
but
the idea is to surround and circle china
with hostile powers
which will prevent it from
breaking out doing anything
that's constant severe threats
uh what's the threat of china
uh
i think it's what i said before
they're there
actually the
most former australian prime minister
paul keating
well-known international statesman had
an article in the australian press
asking what actually is the threat of
china what are we worried about
he ran through the reasons and none of
them make any sense i said the real
threat of china is china is there
it's there and it refuses to follow
orders
here i think we can go back to the
godfather image take say cuba
why why does the united states devote
such extraordinary efforts to torture
and destroy cuba
i mean there's no precedent for it in
in history in fact like right now
cuba has a huge fire
it's getting support from mexico from
venezuela
not the united states
you have to strangle and torture the
cubans
well we know the reason
i go back to state department records in
the
1960s very explicit
the threat of castro
is his successful defiance of policies
going back to the monarch doctrine
in 1823
which stated the intention of the united
states to dominate the hemisphere
do it then britain was too strong but
they understood sooner or later
the us would be able to do it
and in fact in 1898
the united states did intervene in cuba
what's called here the liberation of
cuba what in fact was the prevention of
the liberation of cuba from spain
u.s intervened to prevent it
turn cuba into virtual colony as soon as
cuba broke out of that 1959 acts began
since then they've been carrying out
successful denying defiance
and the godfather doesn't accept that
it doesn't matter whether there are any
resources or not
just to
and i had a comment on what vijay said
about
the congo
my own feeling is even if the congo
hadn't had uranium they still would have
killed the mumba
because the congo is the richest most
powerful part of africa
if it succeeds in developing it'll bring
all africa along with it
the u.s not having that
so the obama was
the mumbo was assassinated the belgian
got there first
cia had him on their hit list
then they installed a
kleptomaniac murderer who would follow
u.s orders just make sure that
congo doesn't move towards successful
defiance or anybody else
well that's china china is not going to
be pushed around
they
have
several thousand years of history they
went through a century of humiliation
ended with the maoist
revolution
they're not going to accept it again
uh the build and road initiative is a
huge initiative of investment and
development you're quite right they're
perfectly willing to work with anyone
corrupt non-corrupt just build this
system which is china based
includes most of asia already
moving to africa even moving to latin
america
u.s backyard u.s can't stop it moving to
the middle east
even israel
so china owns
half the haifa port you know the u.s
doesn't like it but
doesn't have the ability to stop it the
united arab emirates is a key to the
chinese what's called maritime silk
route which reaches to the
red sea onto the
way of moving towards europe
um which will
probably want to join this it's much too
rich and oriented to avoid
china's just moving steadily slowly no
violence
investment development the u.s can't do
anything about it it's going crazy it's
part of the reason for the hysteria
about china now i mean the hysteria is
just beyond discussion
so it takes something like
the united states is collapsing from
within we all know that
the bridges are collapsing the subways
don't work nothing works the whole
system doesn't work
so we need
spending to rebuild the united states
well finally congress got together
and did agree to a bill
for some construction of infrastructure
not because the united states needs
bridges because we have to out-compete
china
it's the china competition bill
i mean this is pathological
you know but it's shows what when the
godfather is in trouble he goes crazy
just to again build a little on what
gnome was saying
first i just want to say from a personal
standpoint
um you know i i think it's important for
intellectuals um
different kinds of people to interact
with each other across all kinds of
barriers i've been a great proponent
of interacting with people that one
doesn't agree with i think it's uh
it's a good part of the human experience
so
you know for the past i don't know
decade more than the past decade
i've developed very close relationships
with intellectuals in china i've held
conversations with them
you know i've spent time talking to
zhang vewe
leading intellectual
he was the translator of deng xiaoping
spent a lot of time talking with
somebody i deeply respect wang hui
teaches at xinhua university and so on
these connections by themselves have for
some people
been a red rag to the bull
because they claim that any contact with
china is somehow
has you
you know in fact influenced by china as
if for instance i don't have my own
brain
um in other words
it goes back to a debate from an earlier
period
when
george w bush borrowing from samuel
huntington you know began to use the
kind of clash of civilizations
rhetoric
um hyped up
between christianity and islam at the
time
now we're seeing a kind of clash of
civilizations rhetoric
between the so-called west
and
russia china and so on
you know at the time when george bush
began to talk in this clash of
civilizations way
leading figures in iran
sent a letter to the united states
government in fact directly to george w
bush
where they said
rather than a clash of civilizations
can't we have a dialogue across
civilizations
strikes me that
many of the western governments led by
the united states have lost the appetite
for both diplomacy and dialogue
strikes me that you know the
demonization of people
substitutes for
a mature attitude toward them look
frankly
the united states knows that in many
areas of economic life
high-speed rail green technology
even now some areas of computerization
certainly telecommunications
chinese firms can produce
goods
as good as the united states you know as
efficient as the united states and of
course cheaper than u.s firms even when
u.s firms produce these goods in china
so apple phones produced in china
are much more expensive than huawei
phones rather than
merely compete commercially
the united states has decided to utilize
its diplomatic military and ideological
force to intimidate china into stop
developing its own technological
capacity
and you know there used to be a familiar
word for that which nowadays doesn't get
used in polite conversation much
the word for that was imperialism you
know you're using extra economic force
to gain advantages
why can't the united states get its act
together produce better phones produce
better technology at a cheaper price
produce green technology why can't it
just compete with china
you know
in the marketplace well it can't and it
knows it can't
and therefore it is willing
to destroy the world in order to
maintain its inefficient economic
domination of the world and i want to
underline the use of that word
it is willing
to push its inefficient economic
domination of the world
rather than
take some lessons from other people not
only the chinese but other people who
are producing things perhaps better
cheaper and differently but you can't
again drawing from the word gnome uses
often you can't get the godfather to
learn new tricks
the godfather's trick
is to go to somebody's stable
take their favorite horse
cut off its head and put it in your bed
that's what the godfather knows the
godfather doesn't understand how to
convince or how to learn and that i
think is something young people in the
united states it's a lesson to take from
this
is that learn how to do things better
learn how to talk to other people
don't use your muscle to maintain your
power because that is bringing the world
near destruction
or well annihilation okay and i'm not a
i'm an optimistic person
but i'm afraid for that i'm afraid this
attitude
is really bringing us to the brink of
a war we can't imagine
