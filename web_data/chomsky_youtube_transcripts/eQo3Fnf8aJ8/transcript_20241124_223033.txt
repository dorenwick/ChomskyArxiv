progressive magazine in madison
wisconsin and a room of one's own
bookstore
and thank you all for joining us tonight
we'll be speaking in just a moment with
uh professor noam chomsky and uh
renowned journalist david barcemian
the
book that has recently come out of their
interviews together chronicles of
descent which covers uh a period in the
1980s and 1990s

there earlier there's a new book coming
out this august called notes on
resistance which will be new
interviews coming up and by the way you

sent to your home
it's also a place on our website where
you can subscribe to the progressive
magazine this is our latest uh
cover the brand new april may issue is
just out in the mail right now
particularly covering uh environmental
issues and
as we always do covering the people that
are doing something about it the
movements and the organizations and the
individuals that are working to address
the climate crisis
well i'm very pleased to begin our
program by introducing my uh
longtime friend and colleague david
barsamian who has been as we just noted
interviewing
noam chomsky since 1984. and
david i think that you and i have known
each other
about that long as well so uh welcome to
the program david barcelona joining us
from boulder colorado
hi norm it's great to be with you and
to uh well have this terrific event a
room with
with the bookstore and the magazine of
course and i'm very excited about having
this book out
it's actually three books in one
chronicles of dissent keeping the rabble
in line and class warfare
spanning this two-decade period
which is i think
leading to
chomsky's political thought and
philosophy
that we've seen play out since those
early interviews in the 80s the
depredations
uh
capitalism uh the continued undermining
of democracy the concentration of uh
wealth and income
uh and the rich getting richer and the
all the problems with uh
neoliberalism
gnome was on all of those topics and
more
from a very early point and so this book
brings together you know lots of
information uh it's really interesting
that it almost didn't happen the first
interview
because i was having some technical
difficulties and i had to hang up and
finally i figured out how to do it
and that was the very first interview
back in 1984
and as i say noah must hold the world
record for
doing interviews he's always been so
gracious and accommodating and willing
to talk to people as he has done
so many times with me over the years
and we should mention that
professor chomsky is actually finishing
up another interview right now
with a different uh outlet and so he's
going to be joining us in just a moment
but uh before we get to that um david
tell us a little bit about your work
with alternative radio which has now
been going for
close to 40 years there in boulder
colorado
bringing voices
not only the voice of noam chomsky but
of so many other public intellectuals to
the
to the airwaves in community radio
stations and some public radio stations
around the country
well i was not very happy with the media
and the media landscape in the united
states in the late 70s
and i hooked up with a local community
radio station here in boulder colorado
kgnu and i started learning how to do
radio doing interviews uh editing
formulating questions producing
etc and that led to uh national
syndication of my program alternative
radio
in the mid 1980s you know featuring uh
voices like of course noam chomsky and
howard zinn and edward syed and ekbal
ahmed and arundhati roy and vandana
shiva a whole host of
activists intellectuals scholars
people who are making a difference and
people who have been literally locked
out of the media who have had you know
very little opportunity to be in front
of microphones or in front of cameras so
i saw alternative radio as a kind of an
electronic umbilical cord
connecting with those voices and
connecting people
with those voices because
part of the way the system operates here
in the country is to isolate people to
think that they're the only ones out
there thinking these thoughts about
capitalism or you know imperialism etc
but in fact they have many many uh
allies
so alternative radio is is now in its uh
36th year
uh just did a program on extinction
rebellion a very militant group uh in
england and uh they have their uh
acolytes here in the united states uh we
just did a debate with uh
varufacus janis vadofakas the greek
politician and economist he was talking
to the financial times editor jillian
tet about can pat capitalism be fixed so
every week there's a new program and
people are invited to go to the website
alternativeradio.org
alternativeradio.org
but also i really want to encourage
everyone tuning in to support the
progressive magazine
this is a magazine that i've been
connected with for
many many years i'm very proud to say
that many of my interviews have appeared
in the progressive
i was very close and inspired to
the previous publisher uh erwin knoll
who did such an incredible job there
at the magazine
in madison
so it's it's an ongoing project
it depends on people just like
you and me uh you know there's no big uh
you know corporate uh sugar daddies in
the wings that are supporting us we
depend on you so please support the
progressive get a copy of this book
and
you know
do what you can to support independent
media thank you so much david thank you
very much and noam chomsky has now
joined us and i'm going to bring him on
the screen and
welcome to uh our event professor noam
chomsky coming to us from uh arizona uh
and uh so we have a a geographic cross
section on the program tonight and i'm
actually going to
disappear from the screen and leave
leave the two of you who have been
speaking with each other about so many
different topics for uh
more than 35 years and all of that being
uh collected this current book and the
forthcoming book so let's uh let's give
a warm welcome now to professor noam
chomsky
hi hello there gnome how are you doing
pretty good sorry apologies for being a
little late i was
solid interviews all day and they keep
running a little bit over
i know the syndrome well let's start
with your favorite newspaper the new
york times
i noticed that in many of our interviews
uh you begin with a lead story that you
saw in the times how has the newspaper
of record been covering the war in the
ukraine
well the
morning new york times is
always a
source of
information and uh
fury
mixed
so
what
what's being left out in the ukraine
story
on ukraine
well i think the new york times i
applaud them they had
a very fine editorial
on ukraine
which infuriated me
fine editorial
in which
for the first time ever as far as i can
recall
they quoted
the wording of the nuremberg tribunal
i don't remember an earlier occasion
very self-righteously
quoted the wording which says that
aggression
is the supreme
supreme international
which differs from other war crimes
in that it encompasses
i'm getting a lot of noise from
somewhere do you have it
um yeah
norm is is the line clear
can you hear me know
yeah let me repeat what i said i'm
applauding applauding the new york times
editor editors
for quoting
i think for the first time
the wording of the
nuremberg judgment
which
sentenced
those accused of
mostly hanging
because they committed
the supreme international crime
which differs from other war crimes
in that it encompasses
the accumulated evil of the whole
everything that follows
so for example in
it encompasses
the
uh
instigation of the
ethnic conflicts that didn't exist
before
which are tearing
which then tore the country apart and
are
carrying the region
it
encompasses
it encompasses the rise of isis
with all the atrocities that followed
however unfortunately that's not what
they were talking about
they were talking about somebody else's
carrying out the supreme international
crime
and they were properly
indignant about it
the official enemy
president putin did carry out
last february the supreme international
crime
uh
comparable in character not in scale
to
the invasion of iraq
numerous other acts of aggression which
i could mention
uh so yes it's probable to denounce it
with a great self-righteousness
forgetting the fact
that
when the u.s carried out
the supreme international crime
actually on a much greater scale
they were praising it
they thought it was fine
in fact
maybe they said it might be a mistake
maybe
we didn't think it through properly but
it's certainly not a crime
and if i try to find
i'll just take that
one example because it's so egregious
but
for that example
the uh
most recent
international crime which the u.s
carried out the most egregious one
is never criticized in the united states
in fact
what's called a criticism
is when
president obama
says it was a strategic blunder
if uh
some russian official today
says
that the invading
of ukraine
is a strategic blunder which of course
it is
but we don't praise them for it
in fact we condemn them bitterly for it
and for not agreeing with the new york
times editors that it was the supreme
international crime
oh yes i
applaud the fact that they
finally said it
and
occasionally they do
phil enemies
be nice if it comes back home sometime
in that respect they're very much like
the soviet press
which is very indignant about american
crimes
often accurately
i don't praise them for that
i don't think you do
we can go on
so for example
let's talk about something that isn't in
the new york times but is quite
important
or any other newspaper as far as i know
i don't think the u.s press far as i'm
aware
has ever reported
one of the most important
policy statements
of the biden administration
related to the iran the ukraine conflict
september 1
19 20 21
a couple of months
few weeks before the invasion
this is a
statement on
the u.s ukraine strategic partnership
september 1st 2021
it
calls for
providing ukraine with
advanced anti-tank and other weapons
within
with i'm now quoting
a robust
training and exercise program
in keeping with ukraine's status as a
nato enhanced opportunities partner
goes on to
finalizing a strategic defense framework
that creates a foundation
for the enhancement of u.s
ukraine strategic defense and security
cooperation
again within the
nato enhanced opportunity
or trim
will
may not have been recorded in the united
states but
you can be pretty confident that
russian intelligence read it off the
white house official
web page
maybe i don't know
but it's possible that this was
a factor
leading to the decision
to move on to the
supreme international crime possibly
you can imagine
you might we might try a thought
experiment
we might imagine say
that china had established
a huge
military system
with many
other
advanced countries as part of it
the most advanced countries in the world
chinese-based
military system
aimed at the united states
and supposed that china approached
mexico
and said
we are now
finalizing a strategic defense
framework with mexico
which will
be the foundation
for providing advanced weapons to mexico
and a robust training and exercise
program with the people's liberation
army
in keeping with
mexico's status
as a
enhanced opportunities partner
joining our
international uh
military system
how would the united states react
well we don't have to say because
as soon as the first
word of this
was expressed
that mexico would be blown away
well that's what we're telling russia
and there is a history
not out of a blue
okay
well i can see why maybe the united new
york times and other papers decided
not to publish this
but again
we can be pretty confident that
the circle around putin did read it
and could draw the conclusions that we
would draw
if
inconceivably
something was done like that with
a chinese
a non-existent chinese huge military
system and say mexico
in terms of
the historical background of the
of the conflict
uh
talk about what was called uh nato not
expanding one inch to the east
this is where representations made to
gorbachev as the soviet union was
collapsing the warsaw pact dissolving
talk about that background which has
gotten very little notice in the media
well since there's been a lot of
evasiveness and
sometimes even lying
about this
i would suggest
that anyone interested
look at the
authoritative
national security archive
online
which has the exact documents
full
exact documents
with the precise wording
these were agreements
between
george h.w bush
james baker secretary of state on the
u.s side
mi phil gorbachev
on the russian side
also
against your gunship helmet coal
in germany which was directly involved
the agreement is unambiguous
explicit
no vacillation clear unambiguous is
gorbachev agrees
to allow
germany to be unified
within nato
hospital military alliance
a little bit of history about germany
and russia which
i don't have to repeat
it's quite a concession on the part of
russia but he agreed
with the condition
stated explicitly and unambiguously
by the us side
affirmed by the germans
that nato will not expand
one inch to the east
meaning east germany
george
h.w bush the first bush
lived up to that promise
didn't abrogate it
when clinton came into office
he began to vacillate actually the best
account of this i know is by
one of the most
respected and astute
members of the us
diplomatic service
ambassador just freeman
who was directly involved in
all of these issues at the time and has
remained so
in a recent interview he describes what
happens he himself had been
working on trying to institute what was
called the partnership for peace
which would be a system
that president bush
advocated and helped initiate
a system that would bring
russia into some kind of
accommodation with the west
it was a loosely formed partnership
which had a
limited nato connection but didn't
require
nato membership it was limited
association but a move towards
integration of the region in a peaceful
alliance
well
it was in being developed up until
clinton
by
1994 ambassador freeman describes
clinton started vacillating
talking as he puts it talking out of two
sides of his mouth
to the russians he was staying we're
living up to the agreement
to the ethnic voting blocks in the
united states
like the polish community he was saying
don't worry we're going to bring poland
into nato
clinton was a political animal he had
his eye on the elections
1994
96-98
uh he got a very angry reaction from
boris yeltsin
who remember was his close buddy
uh yellston was his favorite in russia
in fact clinton intervened directly
and proudly in fact in the 1996 election
to ensure
yeltsin's uh
election
yeltsin bitterly protested
italy protested again in
1996.
clinton disregarded it
1997
probably with an eye on the 1998.
yeah but
he incorporated poland
hungary slovenia into nato
russia objected
didn't do anything about it
uh many other actions which i don't have
time to review
humiliating russia consciously
uh
george w bush ii
he tore the whole thing to shreds
they just invited in
every country that wanted to along
versus border
russians protested
didn't matter we were the boss we won
the war they lost we'll do we feel that
uh the 2008
uh
bush this is the second bush
made the
reckless decision
to invite ukraine into nato
it was vetoed by
france and germany
but it stayed
on the table under u.s pressure
and remains so
leading ultimately
to the
biden statement that i
quoted
from 2021
and throughout the period
moves towards
incorporating ukraine more closely into
nato
this was against the advice of every
high-level
u.s official
who had any acquaintance with
uk with the eastern european situation
defense secretary william perry
clinton's defense secretary
came close to resigning in protest
out of clinton's decision to bring the
countries into nato
george cannon
famously he's now being quoted
warned against this is extremely
dangerous
same was true of other high level
officials
jack matlock
ambassador reagan's ambassador one of
the leading russia specialists
strongly opposed it mourned against it
current head of the cia
william burns also a russia specialist
warned against it
also his predecessor as cia director
stansville turner
just about every
again every high level diplomat who knew
anything about it and a
long list of government advisers
warned against this all the way they
pointed out that
russia will tolerate a lot
but they have a red line
they're not going to tolerate
a
nato membership
for
georgia
and ukraine
right within their
geostrategic heartland
that was understood on all sides
us went ahead
most recent step
was the
september 2021
uh
policy statement that i read
that i quoted from before
well doesn't justify
uh putin's carrying out the supreme
international crime there's no
justification for that
but it's worth thinking about
and it's also worth
thinking through the
thought experiment that i mentioned
about the
unimaginable
inconceivable
possibility of china and mexico doing
something similar
well
talk about also
the
trump administration withdrawing from
the inf treaty
in 2018. that had a big impact on moscow
sorry
could you repeat that the inf treaty
in 2018
that the us withdrew from
you're not hearing me
i'm here it's not clear i'm afraid
maybe it would help if you put it up in
the chat can you do that
i think let's see
yeah i was asking you about the about
the inf treaty
about the
inf treaty the us withdrew from in
2018.
the 2018
yeah
sorry what one second
does that mean
yes
that was a direct one of many directions
to russia
now we're up to donald trump
uh the two
uh
republican presidents in the
in this millennium have
been
hearing abort
what's left of the arms control regime
started with george w bush
i think it was 2004
dismantled the
abm treaty
that banned
anti-ballistic missiles
a
very
dangerous move
and a major threat to russia
because the point of it was to allow the
united states to place
abm
systems
virtually on the russian border
these are basically
first strike systems
they can't possibly deter a first strike
everyone knows that
it's conceivable they might deter a
retaliatory strike
every strategic analyst on all sides
knows that they're a first strike weapon
furthermore they can easily be refigured
easily
to include offensive missiles so they
were a major threat to russia
bush dismantled the treaty it's also a
threat to us but that's not a
consideration
uh
donald trump came along
and used his famous wrecking ball
to destroy
whatever else he could
one was the
treaty you mentioned
the inf treaty
the reagan gorbachev treaty of 1987
which banned
short-range missiles in europe
this was a major step towards
international peace
missiles
five to ten minutes
from moscow
pershing missiles
are a major threat to peace
remember that
russia is a
weak country
it's a poor
weak country its economy is on the scale
of
italy and spain
it happens to have major weapons
but nothing much else
it's early weren't its warning systems
for
under attack are old-fashioned
radar-based systems
only reached the horizon
gives russian
analysts a couple of minutes to decide
whether a
warning is real or an accident and there
are many accidents
well the inf treaty
improved that enormously by banning
short-range missiles
trump got rid of it
also
got rid of the open skies treaty goes
back to eisenhower the last conservative
president
which uh who
the open skies treaty gave both sides
information about the other's plans also
a major contribution to world peace
uh
he was about to destroy
the new start treaty
the last remaining treaty which puts a
limit on nuclear weapons
fortunately
he was voted out just in time
biden was able to
save that treaty
literally by a few days it was
meant to expire on february 5th 2021 so
that remains but trump did what he could
to destroy the remaining treaties
including enhancing threats to russia
and he tried to make it very clear to
russia that he meant these threats
so when the
in august
2018
when he dismantled the inf treaty
immediately
within days
the u.s launched missiles
violating the treaty
telling russia
i'm not just talking i mean it
i'm putting dangerous tree uh missiles
developing i've developed dangerous
missiles aiming at you
a couple of minutes from moscow
that was the word to mosque to moscow
of course they reacted
they're not nice guys themselves by any
means their criminal leadership we saw
it again in the invasion of ukraine
but they're also
trying to defend themselves if
china
put missiles in
mexico
aiming at washington
we wouldn't like it very much we'd do
something about it
talk about
the
position of china india and israel
on the invasion of ukraine
well
morgan you can get a sense of this a
good sense
by looking at a map
a map of sanctions
who imposes sanctions on russia
it's a very interesting map
take a look at it you can pick it up on
the internet
uh the
sanctions
are imposed by the english-speaking
countries
by europe
and by those who
apartheid south africa called honorary
whites japan
its former colonies
south korea and taiwan
that's sanctions
not the rest of the world
the rest of the world is condemning the
invasion
as a crime
but basically asking
what's the fuss
this is what you guys do all the time
we're the victims of it
we know about it so yes we deplore it
we condemn it
and we're glad that you finally see that
there's something wrong with
violent aggression
in violation of the numeric principles
in international law
glad that you see it but we're not
getting excited about it
that's basically the
global south
by now the
last more or less civilized part of the
world
uh
well what about china
it what about india
india is just standing aloof
they're not gonna they don't want to
antagonize russia
they don't antagonize china they have
their own interests
so they deplore it
but don't go beyond that
take china
china
pretty much the same position
if you look at the chinese press
it's actually supporting russia it's
repeating chinese propaganda
russian propaganda as far as i can tell
uh
the
we can't really tell because the united
states has banned
all
russia-based uh
systems of
so-called information systems so we
can't get it directly but you can read
al jazeera
which reports
russian public
the chinese and russian public
information so china's
seems to be pretty much reiterating the
russian propaganda line
but like the rest of the global south
they're standing aloof
now china
unlike
india and other countries could play a
role
a significant role
in bringing the ukraine crime to an end
they could begin to take part in
serious negotiations
which might
lead to
what everybody knows is the
possible outcome
they're not doing it
well we
might crit others
should criticize them from this
but americans are in no position to
criticize them
because they are taking the same
position as the united states
the united states is refusing
to enter
into negotiations which might
lead
to an outcome to a peaceful outcome to
the problem
quote
ambassador freeman again
again one of the most respected figures
of the diplomatic service as he put it a
couple of days ago
the american position
is to fight to the last ukrainian
but to do nothing
to
move to
terminate the crisis and he goes on
further
to say that it's worse the united states
is actually accelerating the crisis
he repeats what anybody who thinks for a
minute would know
when
president biden
accuses
uh biden accuses putin
as being a war criminal
says your only choice is to go to the
hague
when that's reiterated by
prime minister boris johnson
your only choice is to go to the hague
your back is to the wall no way out
when he does that he's telling
putin
and his
circle of hard men
that you might as well go for brook
you've got no choice
no matter what happens you're finished
don't no chance to escape
so
might as well use
the capacities we have to destroy
ukraine and may be threatened in nuclear
war because you've given us no other
choice
i happen to be quoting ambassador
freeman pretty much paraphrasing but
it's pretty obvious
any analysts in the world can see it
so china
is basically following the us position
but not as extreme as the united states
it's not pushing for the destruction of
ukraine and the move towards
a
possible
uh international
war meaning terminal war
well what china's doing is bad enough
but we're not much positioned to
to
charge them for it we have to pay
attention to what's happening here
which we can do something about
it's criminal for the united states to
be taking this position
we may ask why
china and the united states are taking
the position that they are
namely
uh
fighting to the last ukrainian
and in the u.s positions
in the u.s case even accelerating the
destruction
well i can speculate but a
possibility is that
chinese and
american leaders are
not too dissatisfied with the course of
the war
in china's case
it's driving russia
into the hands of china
to become a subordinate
to the expanding
chinese
global system
mostly a
investment in
a
loan system which is huge bringing in
much of the world
now russia's being brought into it as a
subordinate
weak country declining
criminal kleptocracy
which does have lots of raw materials
and can provide them probably at
bargain prices when western markets dry
up
so for china that's fine can also
provide heavy weapons
what about the united states
well
putin and his
criminal
foolishness
provided the united states with an
enormous gift
he handed the united states europe
on a silver platter
he thrust europe deep into the pocket of
the united states
if there had been
anyone in the kremlin
with a limited resemblance to a
statesman
he would have seized the opportunity
to draw
europe france and germany
draw them
into
an accommodation with russia
in something like the
gorbachev vision of a
european common home
they have plenty of reasons to do that
commercial relations
security reasons
very much to their advantage
us of course is strongly opposed
but
might not have worked but a statesman
and the kremlin would have tried it
and even had some opportunities
with macron's
limited efforts that
interchange with putin but instead
they did what you expect of
violent autocrats
reach for the guns
don't think about
a
diplomatic settlement that would require
statesmanship
gift to the united states
very harmful to itself
remember that
not talked about much here but this is a
issue that has been alive
all throughout the cold war
back to the end of the second world war
have been a major issue about the status
of europe
europe's had choices
one choice
was to join in subordination to the
united states
within
what's called the atlanticist framework
meaning basically nato
us sets the rules
gives the orders europe obeys
that's one possibility
the other option
was for europe to move
to
become what was called a third force
an independent
force in world affairs
not subordinate to the united states
that was basically
charles de gaulle's proposal
uh the uh
uh
furrow as he put at a
europe from the atlantic to the euros
including russia with no military
alliances
us was strongly opposed
came
became
historically
uh
apparent
in 1999
1990 1991
when the soviet union collapsed
the discussions that we discussed
earlier
gorbachev
proposed again a european common home
no military alliances
accommodating
russia
and
the west within a
commercial security framework
independent of u.s control well
putin didn't try
it might have succeeded
it would have averted the invasion of
ukraine
and led to a much different world
a better world in my opinion
uh
but
russia instead
moved it once to criminal aggression
and the united states i'm sure is
applauding
because
it gave the united states exactly the
gift that it wants
a subordinated europe
and totally obedient to the united
states
now moving towards
militarization
uh
great joy in the offices of
lockheed martin the other arms producers
you're
getting massive arms that
doesn't need for any purpose except
enriching
arms manufacturers
the fossil fuel companies are overjoyed
the ukraine invasion is an enormous gift
to them
it gets these
annoying environmentalists out of there
here
as they are now saying openly
they want to be loved they want to be
hugged as they put it
because they are now
free to
expand the use of fossil fuels and even
get lauded for it because they're
saving civilization
by
racing as quickly as possible towards
destruction of the environment
that's the world we're living in
okay
we can pretend it's otherwise but that's
the way it is
so the u.s
u.s
hawks
military system
fossil fuel industries
other major parts of the corporate
sector are delighted
china
probably sees that it's to its advantage
so the us is therefore
continuing
to fight to the last ukrainian
avoiding the chances
to do something to end these horrors in
fact escalating them
and china is not using
the measures that it could
to try to help put an end to these
horrors
that's what we're facing right now
certainly the war
in ukraine has
actually pushed in deep into the back
pages very important reports coming from
the un ipcc
uh in the last few weeks those those
things have been relegated to page 12 or
18
the back pages of the newspapers these
are very critical developments about the
future of humanity and the planet
well
the future of the human species
and in fact life on earth
is in a very
fragile situation now
a couple of
days ago
i think it was april 4th the
ipcc the
international
community of scientists
came out
with another
formal statement
assessing the state of the environment
the most dire statement
they have made so far
extreme statement
warning that we must begin
right now
to cut back
substantially
the use of fossil fuels
fixed amount every year
until within a couple of decades we have
ended their use
if we don't do that we're heading
directly
to
tipping points
irreversible tipping points
where processes will begin to take
shape that can no longer be controlled
and will lead to
the kind of environmental destruction
which will
make life
not worth living for those who manage to
survive
that's the warning of april 4th
to say that's in the back pages and
quickly disappearing
and the front pages are
we have to increase
fossil fuel production
we have to load
hug the fossil fuel companies
because they're saving civilization
by maximizing the production of fossil
fuels
we have to build
new facilities to
provide
liquefied national gas to
uh
europe
has nothing to do with ukraine but
russia won't even be available for years
but we have to prepare for it
we have to race for disaster
um and the most
evil demon you can imagine
couldn't have put together a situation
like this
but that's the reality
where do you see
uh
nato
evolving into as a you know a military
alliance uh threatening uh russia and
other countries to its east
sorry i couldn't hear could you say it
again
nato's evolution into a kind of strike
force for u.s
imperialism
i'm afraid i can't
hear it
uh can you hear me now
could you put it in the chat can you
hear me now okay
yeah could you say it again yeah i'll
speak up yeah uh the evolution of nato
into a military well it is a military
alliance but how that threatens the
interests of russia
it's only the united states hasn't and
its allies that have national security
interests
designated enemies such as russia or
syria or north korea they don't have
national interests
nato as a strike force for imperialism
what what about that
well nato
during the period when the soviet union
still existed
you could claim
at least with some limited credibility
that nato was a defensive alliance
not very much credibility in my opinion
but at least it wasn't observed
with the collapse of the soviet union
that ended it's not a defensive alliance
there's no soviet union no soviet threat
that was actually recognized
right away
by the first bush administration
it's very interesting to read their
public
positions around
1990-91
there was a new national security
strategy there were budget
proposals and they're very interesting
to read
what they say is well
soviet unions collapsed but we have to
maintain
an advanced
and expand our military force
not because of the russians
but because of
what they called the technological
sophistication
of third world powers
i'm not making this up
because of the technological
sophistication of third world powers
we have to maintain this
massive military system
we have to maintain
what they call the defense industrial
base that's a euphemism for
high-tech industry
which rests very highly on government
subsidy so we have to maintain that
and the most interesting part
was intervention forces
we have to maintain
intervention forces aimed at the middle
east
and then comes this interesting phrase
where the
serious threats we faced
could not be laid at the kremlin's door
in other words
sorry folks
we've been lying to you for
70 years
it wasn't the russians that made us have
major intervention forces aimed at the
middle east
it was
what we call
radical nationalism
moves towards independence
that we don't like
that's it and we have to maintain
intervention forces for that
there was a brief period when the cloud
lifted
and you could see
stated clearly
what policies were
didn't last long
pretty soon the cloud came back
with nato being a defensive alliance
although its actions were offensive
its actions were
bombing serbia
in 1991
purposely a russian ally
bombing undertaken in a
manner to be of maximal humiliation to
russia
the russians weren't even informed
uh
there was a pretext for the bombing
pretext was we it's humanitarian
intervention we have to bomb the stop
serb atrocities
and in order to back up this story
there's been a huge propaganda campaign
which inverts the chronology
claims that nato intervened to stop the
serb atrocities when in fact the serb
atrocities which were very real
were the anticipated and predicted
consequence of nato bombing
that is
substantiated with solid
documentation
from the best possible sources
osce observers on the ground many others
but it doesn't matter
the story that's needed
is inversion of the chronology so that's
what you read
so this was straight nato aggression
with no pretext
uh
no we're running out of time so just in
the moments we have left talk about the
importance of such independent voices as
the progressive magazine and how vital
it is to public discourse add another
sentence about that
uh
then came further interventions but
let's look at nato's official policy
official policy
nato's official policy is it must
protect
energy sources
throughout the world
energy sources and pipelines
that means nato can do anything anywhere
around the world
that's not a defensive alliance
and its activities
show that
the nato bombing of libya
in violation of security council orders
that
nato itself had instituted not defensive
in fact just a fraud
strike force for imperialism of course
okay sorry to interrupt go ahead
talk about in the moment we have left
the importance of independent voices
like the progressive magazine
this one
independent voices like the progressive
magazine and their importance
you still can't hear me
i'm sorry but sorry and here okay yeah
we're having independent voices in the
world
yes
in like the progressive magazine
well the global south is an independent
voice
in fact the leading independent voice
uh what they're saying is uh in the
united states of course there are
independent voices we're right now
celebrating one of them
the progressive magazine
long history
back to
fighting bob
as a independent voice independent
critical voice
there are some others
democracy now
in these times
intercept
uh
there are independent voices and they
make a big difference
they had better be kept alive
they're at the margins they don't get
major contributions from big
corporations
they're not
owned by uh major
super-rich magnates like rupert mood or
they have to be supported by
individuals who
hope that
democracy and
human rights
and
decency can somehow survive this
onslaught
so those are independent voices
plus the books that you have in your
hand
indeed
indeed chronicles of descent a
collection of uh three books that we did
in the 1980s and 1990s keeping the
rabble in line chronicles of dissent and
class warfare
