hello everyone sorry for the delay there
was a little bit of a question there
what we were doing
thank you carly dr gosh esteemed poets
thank you very much nice to be here my
name is winston riley
i'm here with the u.s solar coalition
but specifically i'm here to introduce
the man that i know a lot of you have
been waiting to hear from
he's also been waiting for us all this
time patiently and i've been
emailing him and i want to tell you just
a little bit about
dr chomsky and why i'm here to introduce
him
as i drove away from boulder last year
i thought that
he would be an excellent speaker for
this group
because
not only has gnome been
working in so many different capacities
for at least 20 years he's had two
significant warnings
for our species
one is the danger that we face because
of climate change
and the other is
a nuclear
accident or provocation
so
i've been told to keep the introduction
short and now i understand why because
we're running out of time
i've never seen a
introduction for dr chomsky to be held
to a minute but
i'll do my best
i think the reason is is because i was
told everyone at aces knows
about dr chomsky
so
you don't need a lot of background
biographical information
i still think it's appropriate to
furnish a little of that but i will tell
you a few things that i'm sure you don't
know
first i'll explain that
there are two people i love born in
1928.
my mother
clarissa riley
of lee's summit missouri
dr chomsky
my mom will be 94 in september
and none will be 94 in december
i will say
that a lot of us didn't realize
who he was we would read books or watch
videos
about political commentary or global
phenomenon
or the cia or
whatever
but you have to dig in to find out that
it was 65
years ago that he published
syntactic structures
and that's also when he started teaching
at
mit
that was a breakthrough
[Music]
phenomena the work
it led to universal grammar theory
generative grammar theory chomsky
hierarchy theory and minimalist
program theory
if you get a chance to go read about his
work in linguistics it's very
fascinating and the way i sort of think
about it is
he realized kids pick up language
not so much from behavior but from
something that's sort of built in
and it's really phenomenal it was
controversial at the time
and he was
it was debated
whether he could be right about his
theories
well as it turns out gnome's theories
are testable
and so the brain trust at mit
started working on it to
decide
and other places too and it's held up in
these 50 some years
or actually 60 some years
and uh then there was you know
a lot of you know that he went to jail
many times as a protester of the vietnam
war
he's written 150 books and he's on i
don't know thousands of videos
and now i want to tell you a part that
you don't know
how i came to
get to call him as a friend
it was
18 years ago that
at my yoga studio in springfield
missouri we screened the corporation i
hadn't seen it yet
and gnome was one of the narrators of it
and it
virtually changed my world right then
and
the internet wasn't something that was
available really for us at that time so
i went to the library i got to find out
more about this guy i hadn't known who
he was
and so the books that were there by noam
i checked them out one after another and
the first one i got i think was
manufacturing consent
and again
my paradigm
changed everything changed and i knew i
had it all wrong about
the world and what was going on
and in that book that he wrote with uh
ed herman i think
uh
his email was in there
and i'm like
would he answer
and so it was about 16 years ago i
believe that i sent him an email
and i explained to him that my filter
now has
so differently changed my perspective on
the world because of him
and i was astounded that later that day
he wrote back
you can imagine
i'm just one of
i don't know thousands of people that
must write him emails and i think he
writes back to every one
he's probably going to kill me to tell
you that
so if you understand uh
the work i mean
to write 150 books do you know how much
you must have to read
he reads
the guy doesn't party i mean he just
works
and
so
i just want to
say something that was a thought given
to me by my friend steven strong he said
you know we all
owe
dr chomsky an enormous gratitude for his
contributions to civilization
and that's correct and thank you steven
for giving me that thought
so ladies and gentlemen i'd like to
present from somewhere
else
then here he's going to come to us on
this big screen
ladies and gentlemen doctor professor
noam chomsky
[Applause]
thank you very much
it's
difficult
to overestimate
the importance of
this conference
other events like it
in fact
impossible to do so
there's no need for this audience
to take time to discuss the fact
that we are
at a unique moment
in human history
decisions that must be made right now
will determine the course of future
history
if there is to be any human history
which is very much in doubt
there is a narrow window
in which we must implement measures
to avert
cataclysmic destruction
of the environment
measures that are quite feasible
as shown in
your invaluable work
and that of others
the facts are clear enough
they raise two questions
one of them
immediate and
compelling the other
probing more deeply
i'll return
to the latter
after a few words on the
immediate crisis
which is severe
the crisis is coming to a head
in washington
in the most powerful state
in world history
what happens in washington now
will determine the fate of the world
for reasons too obvious to review
what is
happening right now in washington
should cause
profound concern
it's not secret
some of it was exposed in the
lead article
in the new york times last sunday and
probably saw it it's a fine report
by energy
environment correspondent
carol devenpo davenport
she reviews a
long
carefully executed campaign to destroy
organized human life on earth
it's an outrageous comment
for which i do not apologize
because it is completely accurate
the campaign
has been carried out
meticulously for years
by the
energy system
it's an enormous institutional structure
consists of course of the fossil fuel
industries
banks other financial institutions
substantial part of the
legal community
and other
centers of private and state power
it also has an international base
it's called nato
it's little known that
post-cold war nato
formally undertook an expanded mission
quoting it
to guard pipelines that transport oil
and gas that is directed for the west
and more generally to protect sea routes
used by tankers
and other crucial infrastructure
of the energy system
i'm quoting
nato secretary
up the hope sheffer
outlining nato's mission
at a nato conference
well the campaign
has a political base in the
republican
party particularly since 2009
the year before
presidential candidate john mccain
included a climate plank in his
campaign program
was insufficient
given the gravity of the situation but
it was a start
republicans in congress were also
exploring such options
the
huge koch brothers energy conglomerate
got wind of this
quickly went into action
for years they'd been working hard to
ensure that the party
never veered from climate denialism and
they weren't going to tolerate this
deviation
they launched a huge juggernaut
bribery
intimidation
[Music]
an enormous lobbying
campaign fake citizens group
and all-out assault
the efforts were successful
you know the consequences i
don't have to run through them
with this in mind
let's return to washington today
and davenport's
column
on sunday
reviewing the
long and carefully planned campaign
of the energy system and its
ramified associates
now reaching consummation
the supreme court
now properly reactionary
is about to consider a case which
if approved
will constitute a major step
towards preventing the government
from enacting measures to restrict the
use of fossil fuels
or to limit the effects of
environmental destruction
if approved it will also serve as a
precedent for others
that are winding their way through the
legal system
relying on a variety of
intricate artifices
designed by the
high-priced law firms that are
making their own crucial contributions
to the project of
destroying organized life on earth
we note again
the extremism of this church
which is
mitigated by the fact that it's plain
truth
campaign has
received the shot in the arm
from the increase in gasoline prices
the major contributor to inflation
accelerated by putin's criminal invasion
of ukraine
the euphoria in the executive offices
of the fossil fuel companies
is matched only but what you see in the
offices of the
weapons producers
they no longer have to face the
annoyance of
fending off
environmental activists
they're now praised for pouring poisons
into the atmosphere
and urged to do more
accelerating the march to destruction
in a sane world
the reaction would be different
we would seize the opportunity
to move much more rapidly
to sustainable energy
and save
coming generations
from a miserable fate
the temporary problem of infectation
severe
indeed
can be
overcome for those who are suffering
from it
by fiscal measures
and more beyond
so options
for example include
turning the fossil fuel producers into a
public utility
economist robert polland has done
some of the main work on climate issues
has shown
that the fossil fuel producers could
literally be purchased by the government
for a fraction of the sums that the
treasure department poured into
compensating
financial institutions
for losses during the early stages of
the pandemic
well there are many options and we're
not limited to those that
cater to the existing energy system
and the grim fate
that it is designing
for the human species
quite consciously
with meticulous planning
now there's a lot more to say about
these topics
which i'm sure
will be elaborated in many productive
ways in the coming sessions
i'll
leave them here
and just turn
briefly to the
deeper questions
questions about
human nature
still more generally about higher
intelligence
humans have unique talents
no comparison
anywhere in the animal world
the two most sadient of these
are thought and language which are
intimately linked
as far back as
classical greece
classical india
two and a half millennia ago
it was recognized
that language is what generates thought
and thought in
a recognizable sense
is what is generated by language
well these talents
enable humans to reflect on what they're
doing
to plan for the future
to evaluate the choices and decisions
to consider the likely consequences
and how they rank
on a moral scale
one speech special feature of humans
that we can and should contemplate
is their capacity for destruction
that was evident
long before
modern humans appeared
two to three hundred thousand years ago
it's a flick of an eye an evolutionary
time
one indication of the capacity of
proto-humans for destruction
is the
steady decline
in the weight of mammals
as the larger ones were eliminated by
more talented killers
of course everything changed when
modern humans appeared on the scene
not at once
for most of their history
homo sapiens
lived in harmony with nature
as those who survived the
depredations of the powerful
still do
precariously
the agricultural revolution
ten thousand years ago
brought changes
the industrial revolution of the
past past few hundred years
even more so
the question
concerned but posed by this history
concerns a
dreaded cat gap
that that
obtains between our
technical capacity to destroy
our moral capacity to control this
impulse
that question
burst into published consciousness
on august 6
1945
a date that no one my age is
likely to forget
i certainly don't
that day taught two stark lessons
first
human capacity
had reached the level
where it could destroy everything
not yet
but it soon would and in fact it did a
few years later
in 1953
when the united states then the soviet
union
exploded thermonuclear weapons
the second lesson
was that very few
seem to care
remember then vividly
the horrible news was announced
there was relief
that the awful war
was over
then everyone went back to their
business
the dread gap
was immense
it was not known then
but the same years
marked a sharp acceleration
in destruction human destruction
of the environment
so sharp that the
world geological organization a few
years ago
identified those years as the
onset of a
new geological epoch
called the anthropocene
that opens a new gap a new phase
in madrid gap
between
technical capacity to destroy
and moral capacity to control this
impulse
well the immensity of the gap
is revealed greatly
by the recent exposure
of the intense
campaign
by core institutions of our society
to destroy
organized human life on earth
and with it
the millions of other species
that we are
wantingly destroying
in the ongoing
extinction
you're all famous you're all of course
familiar
with the famous doomsday clock
said every year by a distinguished
panel of analysts who assess the
state of the world
set the hands of the clock
a certain distance from midnight
meaning termination
the clock was first set
in 1947
seven minutes to midnight
1953
when humans had
demonstrated the capacity to destroy
everything the minute hand was set at
two minutes to midnight
since then it's oscillated
that's recognition
of the threat grew
analysts began to take global warming
into account
midway and to
president trump's term in office
the minute hand was again set
at two minutes to midnight
first time since
1953
by the end of his term
the analysts abandoned minutes
turned to seconds
100 seconds to midnight where the clock
stands now
the clock will be set again in january
good case can be made
that the second hand
should be moved closer to midnight
the primary concerns have been
the growing threat of nuclear war
and the failure to prevent
legal global heating
in the last few years a new concern has
been added
the deterioration
of the arena of rational discourse
which is all too apparent
unless we can use our capacities for
thought
in an arena of rational discourse
there's no hope of closing the dread yet
in time to save ourselves
there is
a still deeper question
which merits a final word
concerns
the famous
fermi paradox
in brief
where are they
fermi was a distinguished astrophysicist
he knew that there are a huge number of
planets
that have the conditions to sustain life
to lead to higher intelligence
and that are within the reach of
advanced human communication
but with the most assiduous search
we can find
no trace of their existence
so where are they
well one response
that has been seriously proposed
and cannot be dismissed
is that higher intelligence
has developed innumerable times
but has proven to be lethal
it discovered the means for
self-annihilation
but did not develop the moral capacity
to prevent it
perhaps that's
even an inherent feature
of what we call higher intelligence
well we are now engaged in an experiment
to determine
whether this grim principle
holds of modern humans
there's not much time
to find the answer
or more precisely to determine the
answer
as we will do
one way or another
that cannot be avoided one way or
another
we will determine the answer
or more accurately
you will determine the answer
like it or not
faith has placed
the current generation in a position
will where it will determine
whether we march on to disaster
or whether the human species
and much other life on earth can be
saved from a terrible
indescribable
fate
the means are available
you're in the lead in developing them
and demonstrating how they can be
implemented
it's an incredible challenge
there's been nothing like it in human
history
which will proceed to an inglorious end
unless
you can lead the way
to facing and overcoming
the challenges that lie before us
thank you
