terrorist primary primary weapon is fear
fear is used as a reason to increase
military spending and to violate civil
liberties however
terrorism can never be completely
eliminated
how can this catch 22 situation be
changed
well i think we can take long steps to
eliminating terror
one very simple step is to stop
participating in it
i mean that would
and i'm not joking i mean people now
talk about the war on terror as being
declared by
george w bush in 2001. that's totally
false it was declared by ronald reagan
as soon as he got into office the core
of american
foreign policy said was going to be
a struggle against a state-directed
international
terrorism and then comes all the fancy
rhetoric
plague of the modern age you return to
bat barbarism and so on
then came ten years of massive terror
by the u.s outland that's why it's never
talked about
i mean hundreds of thousands of people
were killed in central america
uh well over a million in south africa
where the united states supported the
reagan particularly supported the
apartheid regime
as part of the war on terror he even had
to override
congressional sanctions by the late 80s
to keep supporting them and the reason
was explicit
the african national congress is i'm
quoting
one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world
that's mandela's african national
congress as you probably know
mandela himself only got off the
terrorist list a couple years ago
he had a special dispensation to come to
the united states
middle east tens of thousands of people
killed in a war on
in the terrorist war i mean the worst
terrorist atrocities there were
run by the united states so for example
the worst the peak
of interest in the media in
international terrorism was 1985.
that's when media editors picked
terrorism in the middle east
as the leading story of the year and it
was fair
the worst terrorist act in the middle
east was in lebanon
a truck bombing which killed 85
roughly 80 people women and girls when
they were leaving a mosque the truck
bombing was
set up to go a big truck bomb to go off
when
people are leaving the mosque hundreds
injured
but that's not part of
the doesn't enter the uh the story of
terrorism for very simple reason it was
organized by the cia
they were trying to kill a cleric
quietest cleric sheikh and they missed
they just killed
you know 80 other people a big fuss a
couple weeks about ago about a
bombing and lebanon which killed some
people and yeah it's terrorist act
didn't come close to this
the next major terrorist act in that
year was
the israeli bombing of tunis on
no pretext just you can kill them it
killed about 70 people you know smart
bombs the whole business
the u.s participated by not informing
its tunisian ally
that the bombers were on their way us
six fleet pulled back
in fact they have to fly over the
mediterranean refuel
of course the us knew it and informed
them
the third major terrorist act was
what shimon peres the great dove he was
prime minister
called the iron fist operations in
occupied southern lebanon was illegally
occupied in violation of security
council
orders and there was resistance so
israel
carried out major terrorist operations
against what they call
terrorist villagers in southern lebanon
that was the third major terrorist act
none of these entered the discussion for
the usual reasons
the reason that it was picked in that
year was because there were
palestinian terrorist acts in which one
american was killed
okay that's a different story so yes
there's an easy and
you can easily extend this but a major
way to stop terrorism is to stop
participating it
and that goes right to the present take
say the
global assassination campaign if anybody
else was doing that
we just call it state terrorism
unimaginable state terrorism
and it elicits terrorism and response
so you bomb a village in you know
waziristan and
kill a couple dozen people pretty soon
their cousin or uncle wants to come back
and kill you
and this is normal and we have plenty of
evidence that it's all over
i mean take say one of the cases where
terrorism was actually ended
not just reduced but ended a serious
case a recent case
in northern ireland ir the ira was a
terrorist organization
they were carrying out pretty serious
actions
no joke you know practically killed the
whole british cabinet once
i was in northern ireland in 1993
went from dublin to belfast it was a war
zone
i met a lot of people and had contacts
one of the people i met
was an ira hitman who was underground
he had just broken out of a british jail
and he was in some
place where he was secure so i was able
to meet him there through some
civil rights activists and we talked for
a couple hours i basically asked him
what
one question what do you think you're
doing
by killing protestants and british his
answer was very simple
they killed my cousin i'm going to kill
their brother
they're going to kill my mother i'm
going to kill their children
and that's how it's going to go well
a couple years later this guy was on the
negotiating team he's now in the
government
what happened is here the united states
played a good role incidentally
under u.s pressure the british
finally got it into their heads that the
way to
deal with the rising cycle of ira
terror was not by more violence but by
paying some attention to the legitimate
grievances
and they were there and as soon as they
started doing that
terrorism declined the negotiations
started i was in belfast
a year ago there's tensions like
ethnic tensions in any city but there's
it's a peaceful city
not a war zone that's the way you deal
with
the minor amount of terror that they do
and dealing with a major amount of
terror that you do yourself
is by stopping it the final word of
thanks
