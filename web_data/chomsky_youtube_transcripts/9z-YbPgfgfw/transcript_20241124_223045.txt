welcome to another episode of the
watchdog as you know each week here on
mint press we are going against the
grain giving coverage to stories which
are routinely ignored by the mainstream
media for that reason we hope you will
like share and subscribe
off the back of this video
and we also hope that you will support
us on patreon if you can
this week we are joined by the legendary
philosopher dissident and linguist noam
chomsky noam thank you very much for
joining us how are you
okay happy with you
so to start with my understanding is
that you've maintained a sharp
separation between your linguistic and
your political ideas
why is that
well one reason is because they're
distinct
uh
another is
as a matter of principle i don't think
we should
introduce
if i'm giving a
lecture on linguistics i don't think
it's appropriate for me to
subject the audience to my
uh ideas about
the political world there are some
kind of abstract connections i've
discussed them now and then
mainly about
what we learn
about fundamental human nature
from the study of our
most distinctive properties what
distinguishes humans from
the rest of the animal world is
basically
language and thought
and the two are pro
arguably identical
language is the
instrument for constructing thought
thought is what we construct and
language
so by looking at
the nature of these systems we
can draw some
if not conclusions at least hints about
what
the common good should be what's good
for human beings
and there is a history of doing this
going back to figures like rousseau uh
delhamphon hobo to others with some
reason i think
now
uh julian assange put it the following
way he said privacy is gone it will not
come back short of a very regressive
economic collapse which
would reduce the eco the economic
capacity of civilization
now when the arpanet the precursor to
the internet was being worked on and
invented as described by yashya levine
in his book surveillance valley there
were actually occupations and protests
institutions like mit
he really positions the internet as
being invented for counter insurgency
purposes following u.s defeat in vietnam
now as someone who has lived the
majority of their life without the
internet and wrote manufacturing consent
before the internet existed as far as i
know or at least before it existed in a
public way
how do you think the invention of the
internet has changed the ability of
power to reproduce itself
well the
internet
as for surveillance i
presume that what we're now saying is uh
being sent to
utah or wherever the energy stores
things and
probably to uh
israeli uh
centers as well maybe a couple others
but
going back to say the 60s there was no
internet
we were invo those of us who were
involved in
resistance activities
i did want to keep some things secret
we took for granted
that the groups that we were working
with were probably infiltrated
just about every group was infiltrated
and you could usually
tell who the infiltrators were
if someone in the group was
dressed up like a
hollywood version of a hippie
and
was yelling off the cops and so on
there was a fair chance you'd see him at
a
federal trial testifying for the
prosecution
so you got kind of sensitized to this
when we were doing things that involved
real human concerns like
helping a deserter get out of the
country or something we never did in a
group
we always did it with affinity groups
two or three people who knew each other
and trusted each other and we could work
it out
so there was there was
there was constant surveillance
sometimes it was so overt it was almost
a joke
but it was there
and now of course it's much more extreme
so yes i think assange is correct
there's
basically no way to
ensure privacy
somebody can always be looking in
if the nsa could be
reading
miracles uh private email
then they can look at ours
actually i don't really feel it's that
much of a problem
the fact is they are overwhelmed with
data
that they have nothing to do with
i've actually seen this come up in
federal trials where i was co-defended
now the fbi had a ton of information
about the defendants
which easily could have
led to prosecution
then use it
because they didn't understand it
because they didn't
know what was going on
they were looking at things from
their perspective which is a distorting
perspective and uh they couldn't see
what was actually happening actually we
saw this in the case of 911.
there was a ton of information
but they just couldn't use it you have
to understand it's
kind of like science or politics or
anything else
you're swamped with information
the talent is
to pick out what matters
and that requires
understanding perception
which
fortunately for us the
spooks don't have
do you view the internet as in some ways
a double-edged sword in that there is
use for building social movements but at
the same time it is really um
adept at getting to the nooks and
crannies of people's private lives and
it renders basically everything visible
and that there's a huge disparity
between access to information between
the powerful and those in society who
are atomized
um how do you view it do you view that
as being use um for social movements
well first of all we should be
a little cautious about it it's true
they have a ton more of information
than we do but that doesn't give them
better access
you have to understand the information
you can have
i know scholars
serious scholars who know everything
about a certain domain
where they work in and who understand
nothing about it
okay
you have to it's quite different to have
information and to be able to access it
uh we all know this you know
you're overwhelmed by the in without the
internet you're overwhelmed by data
but
what matters is being able to see
through it and see what's significant
as far as the social media are concerned
i should say
first of all i don't use them myself
i think they're a disaster
but they are kind of double aged
so take say glasgow a couple days ago
there were huge demonstrations in the
streets very important the most
important thing the only important thing
that happened at glennsville
i'm pretty sure they were organized
through social media
that's usually the way it's done
and it can be very effective
you can also reach people like we're
doing right now
way out at the margins which can reach
people which they're not going to get
through
the mainstream
so it has positive aspects
and it has a downside
one downside is
what you mentioned
you're
an open book
uh
to power systems that have the resources
to
look into what you're doing if they
want to do it
uh but probably even worse than that is
that the
social media have had a tendency to
drive people into
self-reinforcing
bubbles of
common belief and understanding so you
don't
you tend to lose
contact what's happening outside your
circle
we see that over and over
that's the way a lot of these
weird conspiracy ideas develop you just
talk to people who share your beliefs
they
reinforce them presume you don't see
anything else
and you collect huge amounts of a lot of
people collect enormous amounts of data
which are totally meaningless
uh which support whatever
weird belief they have
you know countries run by
sadistic pedophiles who were
involved in torturing children
about 25 of republicans
if you're in those circles and
that's what you read and you find this
little
tidbit of data that tidbit of data and
put them together pretty soon you have a
construction you can actually believe
we see a lot of that now quite a lot
and it's very harmful
it's
it's preventing the
proper treatment of the pandemic
it's even much more serious than that
it's preventing
efforts to deal with the
truly existential crisis of global
warming
take
the trump years
pulls through that among republicans
during the trump years
regarding
global warming as a serious problem
declined by about 20
and it's not just a serious problem it's
an urgent problem
well that's lethal
lethal for human survival
and if all you're doing is looking at
fox news and breitbart and
listening to trump and
his acolytes and congress humans which
you believe
i
also it struck me um
with the
conferences in glasgow we're in a
situation where the u.s military
pollutes more than 140 countries put
together
but yet
military emissions
were not present in any of the
negotiations they were completely off
the table
do you think there's any way that
without the involvement of emissions by
the military
we can
turn
the
turn our fate away from the disaster
that we are living through and headed
towards an even worse one
is that possible without the inclusion
of military emissions
that's a very serious problem
as you say it's
at the level of many
medium-sized countries
and not only that but the military
greatly increases the threats to us
greatly increases them and every
strategic analyst knows that
so upgrading
a fixed position
icbms
minute man
it's not a threat to anyone else it's a
threat to us
and it's well known and understood and
they continue to do it
these are fixed position
meaning they're targeted by any
potential enemy
meaning if there's any
threat even threat warning of potential
nuclear war
there's a strong temptation to send them
off
it's use them or lose them it's called
that greatly enhances the threat of
nuclear war
everyone knows it but they keep
expanding them in fact they're being
expanded right now
over the advice of just about every
strategic analyst
and it's done for
crass political reasons
uh some
congressman in a rural state
wants the emplacement
in his state
because you pick up a couple of jobs and
a little bit of profit from businesses
that way
so let's destroy ourselves
now this is happening on every front
it takes a
your right to point out to the uh
the military
emissions but a lot more happened at
glasgow which is quite intriguing
so for example there was a lot of
excitement about
the fact that the
big financial institutions you know
blackrock all these guys
said that we have
130 trillion dollars
that we're ready to put into
dealing with global warming
and john kerry the u.s negotiator was
ecstatic that we finally have
the magic of the market working for us
you know
how can we lose
the market the holy market is going to
work for us
130 trillion dollars for
deal with global warming
until you start reading the footnotes
we will use 130 trillion dollars
if we are guaranteed
that there's no risk
by the
international financial institutions
so we'll do it the way the market
actually works
not the market that they teach you about
in econ 101
but the actual market
the bailout economy
the one where
business wants to be sure
that the poor
and the working people suffer the
ravages of the market but they are
protected
uh they're protected by not only
bailouts but via
implicit government insurance policy
in the case of larry fink and blackrock
by a guarantee that it'll be riskless we
only make profit we can't lose anything
you know that market we now have on our
side and we know how that market works
okay see these things are just kind of
under the radar
this one was actually pointed out in a
good analysis by a very
fine political economist adam twos and
the british press
but
that's the kind of thing you have to
look for
so yes military missions are
important
uh carrie's excitement about
the magic of the market
turns out to be the real life market
not the imaginary one
also the scary thing about blackrock is
they are the top shareholder in shell
and while they are clearly part of the
problem
they are have presented themselves as
the solution but when we look at the
fire grenfell tower in london
we see that the
cladding and the insulation was applied
to the building off the back of kyoto
agreements and the government's
obligation to lower carbon emission and
what happened was you had
brofama which was an insulation lobby
um
basically get the government to
subsidize them insulating buildings the
problem was is that companies like
arconic who put the cladding on grenfell
with six millimeters of polyethylene in
the middle of it its top shareholder is
also black rock
and of course they put essentially
solidified petrol on the side of this
building and now we have a crisis across
the country where hospitals hotels
cinemas schools
and by some estimates about a million
leaseholders are now trapped in flats
which they can't sell which they're
expected to still pay a mortgage for
which have flammable solidified petrol
um insulation on the side of it so
in a situation where neoliberalism
has you know
climate change is one of the ways in
which neoliberalism kills people
deregulated
building uh
construction industry is another way in
which neoliberalism kills people when
our situation is as deregulated as this
when you know there are those that say
uh the green new deal will require um
you know a huge amount of lithium
extraction extraction is responsible for
50
of um
[Music]
carbon emissions
when the situation is as deregulated
as this is
um
what can we expect
well if we let the
institutional structures
function freely
we can expect disaster
uh unregulated capitalism
is a suicide pact
that's been
understood by the business world for
hundreds of years
they've never accepted capitalism
they've always demanded
a powerful state to intervene in their
interests
that's as old as capitalism
it goes back to
adam smith
they
pointed out that
what he called the masters of mankind
his day that was the merchants and
manufacturers of england
they make sure
that they control government policy
and they
ensure that it's
that the
actions of government
uh are
that as he put it
their own interests are most peculiarly
attended to
in other words we get what we want from
the actions of government which we
control
and then he added however grievous the
effects may be on the people of england
and of course their victims elsewhere
that's 1776
not a new insight
that's the way the institutions function
they will never permit capitalism
they'll never permit markets because
they're too destructive and they know it
so they want to control
the institutions of power
in their own interests
what's called
take a look at what's called
neoliberalism
what we've been subjected to for the
last
45 years or so
reagan thatcher basically
uh you look the word up in the
dictionary
sounds very nice
market principles everyone has a fair
chance
you look at the practices of
neoliberalism
bitter
unremitting class war
and it shows up in the outcomes
so just to give
one example
the
brand corporation super respectable
tried to do a study of the
what they call the transfer of wealth
from
the lower 90 percent of the population
to the very top
actually fraction of one percent
during the past 40 years
their estimate is roughly on the order
of 50 trillion dollars
from the poor and the working class a
large part of the middle class
to the super rich
well that's class war
uh deregulation is part of it
they really you read in economics text
says deregulation's great it leads to
more competition
turn to the real world better for
consumers and so on go to the real world
it leads to monopolization
because the big fish
eat the little ones
right now for example just to make it
personal
for about
two months my
wife has been trying to get a
badly needed upgrade on our internet
good luck
let's see if you can get through the uh
recorded phone calls
and the missed appointments and
this and that which you can do if you
have a virtual monopoly
especially when you have a state that's
trying desperately to prevent economic
development
so we happen to be in a
a away from the town center
where you don't have
high-grade internet
uh you have it in the business center
but you go
10 miles outside you lost
you couldn't make a deal with china
to get
high-grade
huawei 5g internet
not allowed to do that we have to punish
ourselves
uh because you're not allowed to deal
with that
those terrible uh
yellow people over there
i mean
actually there's a
pretty interesting article in the new
york times this morning by
benjamin applebaum good economist
who
studied
reviews the effect of
trump's tariffs
in the last uh
during his four years extended by biden
turns out as
any reasonable person would assume
and as many economists pointed out
that they're paid for by americans
and in fact now they're paid for by the
global economy
as he goes through the production of
chassis for trucks
not allowed to get cheap chinese ones
that might help china develop
so therefore we have to get american
ones except they're not produced here
or if they are they're too expensive so
therefore you have
supply line
crashes
because ships are standing outside the
los angeles harbor and there's no trucks
to move the commodities
but yes we hurt china a lot yeah
i also remember your appearance on the
firing line with william buckley when he
in a sort of a veiled threat he he said
that if you lost your temper he would
smash you in the goddamn face
looking at william buckley it's quite
interesting because in the 1950s he
actually worked as an undercover agent
for the cia what is the extent to the
revolving door between the intelligence
services in the united states and the
media today
well there were exposes in the 60s
of large-scale
cia penetration of media
came out in the ramparts left-wing
journal and
got investigated and so on
i
don't know if there's anything like that
now and i frankly don't think it's
needed
because the
shared assumptions
are so
overwhelming that
it's probably not needed uh buckley
didn't need a
cia connection to have his beliefs
in fact he probably went well to the
right of the cia
which tends to be
moderately liberal sometimes
i think the real issue is the
set of
shared assumptions of
intellectual political
cultural elites they don't vary very
much
somewhat in fact
a long time ago i think it might have
been
c wright mills back in the 50s
said that the united states is a
single party state
the business party
with two factions
democrats and republicans
back in those days they were not that
different
now they're pretty different the
democrats have moved slightly to the
right
but the republicans have gone way off
the spectrum
they're not a political party in the
sense of
parliamentary democracies anymore
sometimes the shamelessness is
almost indescribable
like
you probably followed kevin mccarthy's
uh
long
discourse to try to hold up the
biden bill i think he talked for eight
hours
uh one of the things he said was
charging biden for failure to deal with
the covid crisis pandemic
this is the spokesman for the party
that has been doing everything they can
to make it worse
blocking mandates blocking
uh
claiming that it doesn't exist
arguing you don't have to have vaccines
barely a majority of republicans have
been vaccinated so first what we do is
devote all our efforts
to making the pandemic much worse
than we blame somebody else for the fact
that it's not under control
this is comparing
shamelessness to a
indescribable degree not the first time
the most striking case which was barely
commented on
is what happened with the withdrawal
from afghanistan
uh trump arranged the withdrawal
worst possible
way
total
lack of concern for afghans
told the
taliban do whatever you like no
conditions
just don't shoot at americans anything
else is okay
you look at the republican party
this was hailed
as a magnificent achievement by our
amazing genius leader
it was featured on their web page
in fact they kept it featured on their
web page
until the debacle
when pop biden pursued a
actually better version of what they'd
been hailing
and it turned into a predictable
disaster at that point they took it off
their web page and started denouncing
the democrats and even the generals for
carrying out what trump had arranged
i mean
this is not a political party anymore
it's a
it's just a gang of uh
out of control
uh
uh
i don't know what i want to want to use
them where you make it up
well i mean here we have
someone that trump quite proudly
described as britain trump i'm not sure
exactly if his grammar was correct but
boris johnson as a pedaler in the same
way trump was of horizontal hatred and
vertical solidarity
we have seen the scapegoating of
refugees and migrants in the same way
that the trump administration and
seemingly um
consecutive u.s administrations have
done in at least policy um
uh
in a you know from a policy perspective
but today we have seen at least 30
people drown in the english channel
trying to reach
this country what is your
analysis or estimation of british prime
minister boris johnson
boris johnson is not my favorite
character
in fact his treatment of refugees
regrettably
is that of the entire european union
european union crimes against refugees
make what trump did look mild
it's much worse
it's one of the worst crimes of the
modern age
i mean there are
thousands of people dying in the
mediterranean
trying to flee from africa
where europe has a certain history
destroyed africa for centuries
people are trying to flee from the
wreckage
the europeans are saying
go drown on the mediterranean
in fact europe is
in the poorest country of africa nigeria
that europe has set up
military bases to try to assist
the
niger
security forces to prevent africans from
getting anywhere near the mediterranean
don't come anywhere near us
we destroy you for a couple hundred
years
we enslave
your
male
female your able-bodied population
destroy you we prevent you from
developing
we murder and slaughter you
but don't come anywhere near our shores
okay
uh this is
i don't think there are words to
describe this
it's uh
it's beyond my capacity to describe
it's a hideous crime
what the united states is doing
is bad enough not far from where i live
incidentally
i live
about
70 or 80 miles from the
southern border you go into the
harsh very harsh desert
right between where i live in the border
there's corpses of
people fleeing from
the wreckage that we created when we
destroyed their countries and are still
doing
and
you have a border but there are people
very good people
and right here in tucson where i live
who go out into the desert
it is very harsh
temperature can be
120 degrees
very harsh in the harsh brush
clinton
purposely
closed off the
points of easy access where people could
ask for asylum to drive them into the
harshest most forbidding areas and still
flee
and uh you know then there could be
helicopters flying over them to scatter
them
so that they get lost in the desert and
die their
border patrols that come by to destroy
water bottles that are left by
citizens trying to help them now the
whole thing is so you know at the
concentration camps for children the
whole thing is a horror story
and of course it's going to get much
worse
as
the climate crisis increases
refugee flow is going to
escalate
exponentially
places like south asia
are going to be literally unlivable
if we continue in our present course
same with much of the middle east it's a
huge disaster now
much more coming
and it's known
and nobody's doing anything about it
except
the good people
who are going out to try to help them
and rescue them
which shows that there is something
in the human character that could save
us
same as the
kids on the street in glasgow
that's the hope
in this context um
very popular
u.s writer
i won't play any stronger than that
jordan peterson has described racism or
thinking about racism as low resolution
thinking he's also described the
university
as being
in the throes of a sort of woke
dictatorship of leftists dominating
these institutions as if mccarthyism
never happened as if the spike ops
infiltration of a thousand political
groups in this country 99 percent of
them being of the left including the
national union of students including the
national union of teachers as if none of
this happened at all
what is your estimation of jordan
peterson's ideas
well peterson is
correct from his point of view
but you have to understand that for him
anything
to the left of attila the hun
is left
so yes in other words anybody who has
one
spark of decency
the minimal consent for other people
willingness to pay the slightest
attention to the facts is the leftist
totalitarian so it's true that they've
taken over everything
but
this is
where he gets his cult following from i
don't understand if you want a
good analysis of him the best one i've
seen is by
nathan robinson and his
journal
current affairs as a very careful astute
analysis of the
peterson cult and what keeps it going
but the fact of the matter is that
the universities
tend to be
by international standards
basically
middle of the road mildly conservative
you have to understand we have to
understand that in what's called
left in the united states is called
right in other countries
take for example what's being debated in
congress
uh right now
uh
maternity leave
uh the united states is joined by
half a dozen pacific islands
in lacking paid maternity leave
they go to brazil the next largest
country in the hemisphere
hardly a leftist paradise
four months of paid maternity leave
two months more
optional under social security
uh plenty of countries have paternity
leave
not the united states
almost every country has
paid vacations
a month or more
not the united states
in fact
one of the
editors of
the financial times world's leading
business journal
london
uh
quipped a while back that if
bernie sanders was running in germany
he could be running on the
right-wing
uh christian democrat program
which in fact is true
his main themes
universal health care
free higher education
i have them in germany have them
everywhere
have in mexico
just here
so what's called too radical for the
american people
is supported by right-wing parties
elsewhere
so from that perspective you can call
the university's left
namely uh
most of the faculties probably
mainstream democrat
you know clinton obama democrat center
right
call that lift but by u.s standards
that's left
you've also gone on record making the
point that the toxic legacy and cancer
rates in fallujah are worse than those
in hiroshima
can you explain that for us please
well i don't remember the exact words
but there is a
definite toxic legacy
using uh
poisoned weapons and so on
now there have been studies for example
of
some of the major battlefields like
fallujah
with a very high incident of
cancer we don't have a real estimate
because
we don't investigate our own crimes we
investigate the crimes of enemies with
intensive
so
you want to study shriver nature you can
every
small piece of bone that anybody could
dig up is investigated when it comes to
our crimes
not allowed to investigate them clinton
for example
blocked investigation
of the uh
east timor crimes which are
apparently the worst sin second world
war we supported them all the way killed
a third of the population when they
finally had
liberty they
wanted to
investigate
deaths during the
last paraxism of atrocities clinton
stopped
when we
bombed the
alchefa the pharmaceutical plant
produced half the pharmaceuticals for a
poor country that couldn't replenish
them
nobody knows the cost clinton board
investigation
in fact
we don't even know the number of people
killed in vietnam because we don't
investigate it
how many people
are victims of
our chemical warfare in vietnam
well we have some measure for american
veterans
not much
nothing for the vietnamese that's not
our business
we're just in the business of killing
poisoning
not reckoning what happened and it's
we're following an ancient script
britain never investigated its
atrocities
france never investigated them
uh only defeated countries have to
investigate them not
not the victors they can pretend it
didn't happen
as we know china today is surrounded by
about 400
u.s military bases there seems to be an
escalation over the south china sea
could you give us your analysis of that
situation
well that's a very interesting situation
the
united states
first of all with regard to the
law
china is
violating
international law
in the south china sea
they are violating a
judgment of an international tribunal
that opposed to their fortifying uh
at small islands their tiny islands
but the united states is not a very
strong position to
complain about that
because the united states is the only
maritime power
which refused even to ratify the law of
the sea
so we have no standing
there are problems in the south china
sea
and they should be dealt with
by diplomacy
and negotiations with the regional
powers in the lead
the united states has no business there
it's now sending
naval armadas
into the south china sea as a
provocative action
britain
the vassal of the united states is
following along obediently and doing it
as well the united states and britain
just made a deal with australia
to supply australia
with a fleet of
nuclear
submarines
vastly enhancing the threat to china
china has about
four
uh old
noisy diesel submarines in the south
china sea its main maritime
area to reach the outside world so we
have to send australia
nuclear submarines to enhance the threat
while we're sending naval armadas
always talking about the great china
threat
what is
i should say that these submarines
uh
they even they do not even have a
strategic purpose
they're there for intimidation
they're not even going to be operative
for about 15 years
by that time of course china will have
built up its defenses
to counter them
which just
increases the level of threat and
provocation
same when britain sends a
uh
aircraft carrier in to try to pretend
that it's still a major power
and follow the bidding of the united
states
uh the
uh
the the claim of the united states
is that we have to preserve freedom of
navigation
freedom of navigation doesn't even arise
there is absolutely no threat to freedom
of navigation
none has been posed has been implemented
what's going on
is a
technicality
in the law of the sea
which the u.s does not rather has not
ratified
but let's put that aside there is a law
of the sea
one of its provisions is to provide
every maritime country
with a 200 mile
economic exclusion zone
eez of every country maritime country
there's a question
what outside operations are allowed in
the eez
the united states claims that military
and intelligence operations are
permitted in them
china
says no he says freedom of navigation
but no military intelligence operations
china is instantly joined by india
which recently
uh strongly objected to u.s
military intelligence
operations in its economic zone
well there's an obvious case
for diplomacy and negotiations
that's all that's at stake
you look at the wording of the law of
the sea it says
uh in the eez there can be no foreign
threat or use of force
so it's a question how to interpret
those words
are military operations a threat of
force
u.s says no china and india say yes
that's the issue
okay
is the answer to that issue
sending in a naval armada
and creating a
nuclear submarine that applies to pride
nuclear submarines
in fact the
former prime minister of australia paul
keating
who's in
highly regarded international statesmen
uh he had a recent article
in the australian press
this is right in the claw of the dragon
you know the ones were supposedly
endangered
uh he asked what is the china threat
he was criticizing the
nuclear submarine deal he says we don't
want this just endangers us then he says
what is the threat of china
it's a question that's very rarely asked
we just scream about it but what is it
and he runs through the various
arguments shows that they're nonsense
and it concludes what i think is correct
the threat of china is china's existence
it exists
as a major power
which the united states cannot push
around
and cannot intimidate
and does not follow you as orders
that's intolerable
any mafiadon can explain that
so europe is okay because europe follows
u.s orders
when the united states
imposes
vicious murderous sanctions on iran
europe objects but it abides by them
because you don't step on the toes of
the
godfather he's dangerous
seriously dangerous not just military
force
us can throw anybody out of the
international financial system
which the us runs
so you don't offend the godfather
uh take a look at the u.n votes on the
cuba blockade
uh 184 to two
united states and israel israel has to
vote with the united states
so it basically
unanimously opposed the united states
everyone abides
by the
blockade
not china
can't intimidate them
that's unacceptable
so we have to destroy them to prevent
them from developing to try to undermine
their economy to send nuclear submarines
to threaten them because they exist and
you cannot tolerate defiance
that's a major principle
of international affairs
that britain acted the same way when it
was running the world
france and its
smaller domains
uh that's imperial power
for the united states it's basically the
world
the u.s has the kind of imperial power
that
had never existed before
[Music]
no you may not have been aware of it but
at one point during the campaign against
corbyn you were very unfairly folded
into it when a key antagonist of jeremy
corbyn actually ridiculously
asserted that you were a promoter of
anti-semitism her name rachel riley a tv
celebrity in this country do you have
any response to rachel riley in this
ridiculous assertion
well i think from a certain point of
view the charge is correct
uh the point of view was explained by
abba eben
the
highly
praised regarded israeli
at that time foreign minister is really
diplomat very much loved and honored in
the west
mainly because he had a nice oxford
accent
so he was a real gentleman
but back in
1972
he wrote an important article
it's worth reading
it was an article in the liberal
uh american zionist press the american
press of the american jewish congress
which is the more liberal
jewish organization
it's called congress weekly i think it
was 1972.
very important article
he was instructing american jews on
their
duty their responsibility
said your responsibility is to show
that any critique of zionism
by which he meant the policies of his
government
any critique of those policies if it
comes from a non-jew is anti-semitism
if it comes from a jew it's jewish
self-hatred
and he gave so it's a hundred percent
uh he gave two examples of
uh what he called neurotic jewish
self-hatred
one was iaf stone
who was a strong supporter of israel but
critical of its policies the other i'm
proud to say was me
so i'm consumed by
neurotic jewish self-hatred that's why i
criticize israeli crimes
but
heaven's point is
a hundred percent
of any criticism of israel
is either anti-semitism
or neurotic jewish self-hatred which we
can get rid of
so that commentator was actually correct
since every criticism of israel
anti-semitism
can't criticize it and if you criticize
it your holocaust is undeniable
if you oppose
israel's invasion of gaza where destroys
the place and kills
thousands of people for a holocaust
denier it follows directly
so there's a certain logic to it
and the attack on corbin from that point
of view was correct
he did
speak up for palestinian rights so he
isn't any semi
because how can you claim
any rights for people who israel is
crushing under a jackfruit
can't do that
it's anti-semitism
but evan is not from the right
incidentally he's speaking from the
left liberal side of the
zionist movement
his government at that time was the
labor government
the
golden mayor government
noam thank you so much for your time
