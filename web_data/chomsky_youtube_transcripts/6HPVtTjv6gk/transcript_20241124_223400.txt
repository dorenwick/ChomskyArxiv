well there is of course the connection i
mean silicon valley
wouldn't exist without
massive
government
spending and
in fact initiative silicon valley after
all feeds off of the existence of
computers the internet the i.t system
satellites
you know the whole
microelectronics and so on but
a lot of that comes straight out of the
state sector of the economy
and silicon valley developed it but
it didn't
they expanded they
turned it into commercial products and
so on but
the innovation is on the basis of
fundamental
technological development that took
place in places like this you know on
government funding
so of course there's at least
and that
continues i mean the
silicon valley also benefits from
as all of industry from
highly protectionist policies patent
policies and things like that which come
out of the government that's part of
what was involved in the sopa conflict
you know
so there's an intimate relationship but
the cultures are
completely different i think
that washington basically works for the
corporate sector
and silicon valley's
at least
technically is supposed to sponsor
initiative and creativity whether it
does or not it's another question
well the internet since it's publicly
created
ought to be publicly controlled
it's
you know after all the internet
originated
around 1960 wasn't
privatized until 1995 it's 35 years in
the public domain during the hard
creative development period
and it should be
publicly controlled
but of course washington is not a system
of public control
it's mainly a system of corporate
control
so
yeah nice we ought to have a free
internet but that means having a free
society
and there's fundamental questions there
i
i don't know what it means to say that
the internet ought to have a voice in
washington
the internet is something created
largely by public funding
what does it mean for it to have a voice
in washington
well tech
technology provides means for
expression and
interchange and so on but
so yes it should be free and open
but there are a lot of constraints on
how it's used um we should not
want to permit uh
providers for example to have any
control over
uh access i'm going to take google say
you know and
i can use it you can use it anyone else
can use it
but we all know that it's designed
so that
it
a
private private power
can influence significantly
uh how you access it
so the first
things that you see when you look up
something on google
could be uh
dependent on
you know the amount of advertising or
something else
it's not uh it's you know of course it's
gonna be
since it is a profit-making institution
it's going to reflect the
uh
interests and concerns of those who
fund it which is advertisers
and so you don't uh
and you're you know you can go to the
50th thing on
a google list and maybe that's the one
you want but the ones you're going to be
directed to are the big funders
well
you know
i mean the similarity is that
concentration of capital
influences virtually everything that
goes on
it influences the
the way the media function it is
very powerfully influenced the way
government works
and it of course influences
the way
corporate sectors
elements like say google or amazon
present
the materials that reach the public
so yes there's a kind of a
you know in a society that has very high
concentration of
of capital narrow sector of the
population that's going to influence
everything
in different ways
well i i think individuals have a right
to privacy
but that ought to include the right
to
prevent
private institutions
from monitoring
what you do
and building up a personal profile for
you
so they can direct you in particular
ways by their
control of the
effective
you know the control over the internet
and that doesn't happen of course
private companies can make a personal
profile
direct you to things that
they'll say that you'd be interested in
but it's their choice not your choice
and
i think that has a lot of dangers as
does government surveillance which is
way too high
so yes there's i think they're all kind
of intrusions into
private rights that are
the make use of contemporary technology
i mean technology
can be used that way it can be used in
other ways technology can also be used
so that individuals will private
individuals will
have access to the way
centralized decisions are being made so
take say wikileaks
i mean wikileaks is a democratizing
force it's giving
individuals
access
to decisions
and thinking by their representatives
in a democracy that ought to be
reflexive but
on the contrary wikileaks is being
heavily
under heavy attack by
by the government and corporations are
participating in that like by closing
down their websites so that's
but you know the julian assange
shouldn't be
the subject of grand jury hearings he
should be given a medal
he's contributing to democracy
i think it's just hatred of democracy i
mean you know i spent a lot of time long
before the technology revolution
there were there was declassification of
documents
and i've spent quite a lot of time
studying
declassified
internal documents
and written a lot about them in fact and
anybody who's worked through the
declassified record
can see very clearly that
the reason for classification
is very rarely to protect
the state or the society from enemies
and most of the time it's to protect the
state from its citizens
so they don't know what the government's
doing
so it's kind of internal defense
which raises a question
should we even have the classification
system
why shouldn't these things be open i
mean there are things that you know you
want to keep secret like the
characteristics of your latest fighter
plane or something like that
but most of what's done
i think is kept secret so the public
won't know
and i think the same is true of whatever
wikileaks exposing and what wikileaks is
exposing is kind of superficial in a way
you know like say the pentagon papers
that's material that went much deeper
that went to internal government
planning back for 25 years and
those are things that the public should
have known about
in a democracy they should have known
what leaders are thinking and planning
about
a major
event a major enterprises like the
vietnam war was kept secret from them
uh wikileaks is providing information on
you know what um
ambassadors are
sending to washington things like that
i mean maybe some of that
has a right to some kind of secrecy but
there's a heavy burden
and i think it'd be pretty hard to meet
i mean i've read everything from
wikileaks by any means but
the parts that i've
read and seen i think are things that
the public should know
it seems that there
so there's a difference in content in
what wikileaks revealed and what the
pentagon was totally different and but
but the medium was different because i
know you were involved in
publishing i was involved in people as
well right yeah but also i had them in
advance and i could write about them and
actually when dan ellsberg was
underground i was one of the people
there were a number of people who were
giving out materials to the press
and but wikileaks happened through the
internet which wasn't really anticipated
that no wasn't there
so do you see a difference in the way
that they were distributed and that
itself being a kind of threat rather
than the content so much
that it has such much more yeah it's
different but i think it's basically the
same threat
the threat is that the public will know
what
the government's up to
and that's you know in any system of
power is going to want to keep free from
public surveillance
that's natural
it shouldn't be but it's very natural
it's worse than that they should they
help shut down the sites
you know they refuse to let them their
own sites be used for distributing and
things or even for payment
at the beginning so
yeah i think that's a kind of a
contradiction if you like
i mean i don't think it's hard to
explain
they're in both cases supportive of us
government positions pretty much
it's the other way around
it's minority rule and
majority
limited rights the fact that
you know set up that way if you read
the framers of the constitution say
james madison
he was pretty clear about it
you look at the
minutes of the constitutional convention
which we have
madison who was the main framer
felt that
then
proceeded to develop a system in which
as he put it
power would be enhanced in the hands of
the wealth of the nation
the more responsible set of men
the men who recognize the need to
protect the rights of property owners
that's why in the constitutional system
the most powerful part of the whole
system is the senate
the senate was wealthy people
and
it was not responsive wasn't elected you
know it was chosen through legislators
or legislatures which themselves are
under
private influence powerful influence
and they were remote from the population
and that's where the
power was supposed to reside
uh the uh
and madison was the house of
representatives which was closer
to the population
had much less power
the executive was
more or less an administrator not an
emperor like today
and uh
and the reason for it was a fear of
democracy and it was pretty frank so for
example
madison pointed out in the discussions
at the constitutional debates the
constitutional convention
that
democracy would be a danger he used
england of course as the model i said
suppose that in england
you had everyone had the right free
right to vote
i said well in that case the
the poor
and propertyless
people who are the great majority
would use their voting power
to
take away the rights of property owners
to carry out what we would call land
reform to say
and obviously that would be unjust so
therefore we can't england shouldn't
have the
real freedom of vote and we shouldn't
either
because as he put it
at one of the primary goals of
government is
to protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority
to make sure that the opulent maintain
their rights
and the constitutional system was
structured so as
to ensure that outcome now of course
plenty of battles about it the last
couple of hundred years have been
struggles about this
i mean even the uh
you know like
the fifth amendment the constitution
fifth and sixth amendments that talk
about personal rights you know right to
a
speedy jury trial and so on and so forth
but what do they mean by person
well they certainly didn't mean
individual of flesh and blood
like native americans obviously weren't
persons they don't have any rights
blacks
no rights in fact they were three-fifths
human according to the constitution in
order to
give slave owners more voting rights so
that's
you know african-americans
women
didn't have rights
in fact in the
women were covered were
the the the british common law which was
kind of taken over
under british common law that women were
property
a woman was the property of
her father or her husband and that
remained true through right into the
20th century
and it wasn't until
1975 that
women had a guaranteed right to serve on
federal juries
so
and poor whites didn't have
rights you know no kind of property
you know all kind of restrictions on
voting so
the person meant
you know relatively well off free
a white man
white man you know
over the years of course that's extended
but
in many complex ways
the
14th amendment after the civil war and
principle
gave
former slaves
they were considered they brought into
the category of persons
theoretically
but if you actually look uh
most of almost all the cases brought
for personal rights under the 14th
amendment were by corporations
freed slaves
couldn't couldn't do it in fact they
were
you know they were pretty much driven
back into something like slavery by a
north-south compact that
allowed the slave former slave states to
criminalize black life which made a
criminal force that was basically
used as a forced labor force up until
the 1930s i mean
you know so yes
in theory there's a
you know there's kind of like a formal
democracy but and in many ways these
were real achievements it was an
improvement over the feudal system and
more advanced than anything else in the
world but
not
nothing that we ought to call a
democracy
well you know
like most technology the
internet is uh
has
mixed effects
um it's a neutral instrument
and most tech you know technology can be
used to liberate or to enslave a
hammer doesn't care whether it's used by
a torturer or a carpenter you know and
the internet is kind of like that i mean
it's very valuable i use it all the time
i'm sure you do
it gives you enormous access to things
you're looking for
but
it's you know it's kind of like um
let's say the
library of congress
i mean you can go into the library of
congress and find information about you
know just about anything but that
doesn't do you much good unless you know
what you're looking for
i mean if you want to become a biologist
let's say
it doesn't help to be able to go into
the
harvard biology library and
all the information is there for you you
have to know what to look for
and the internet is the same just
magnified you have this huge mass of
information but what what is it that
matters what doesn't matter what makes
sense what doesn't make sense
you have to have a framework of
understanding and of interpretation in
order to even make use of the
information
and
you know our whole
educational and cultural system is not
designed to provide those
intellectual tools so people are often
lost
and the internet often becomes a
kind of a cult generator you know
people get
strange you know somebody puts up some
weird thing somebody else thinks it's
yeah maybe think that's the way things
work and pretty soon you have some cult
going
that it's not the fault of the internet
it's the fault of a
system of it's it's fault of a
social
cultural system that doesn't educate
people properly and in fact on purpose
they don't want to educate people
properly
you know
it's different of course but
if you look at
just take
ease of interchange among people
i mean the the internet of course your
email is faster than letters
right
on the other hand
the transition from
sailing ships to telegraph
was far greater
than the shift from
the postal service to email
you know that was a fabulous change it
meant instead of if you sent a letter to
england instead of waiting a couple of
months for a response
you got it instantly
that's a huge change
and
every one of these changes of course
increases
opportunities uh
also increases means of control and
domination
so it is kind of like a hammer you know
of course it's different but
the technology itself it doesn't you
know
it doesn't determine how it's used
depends on the social cultural economic
context in which the
technology is made available
superficially
very superficially so take social media
and take a look at the way they're used
i mean a lot of the way they're used is
very constructive a lot a lot of things
are done that couldn't be done before
on the other hand a lot of the effect of
social media
is to set up
extremely superficial contacts among
people
so there are people i mean i
thinking of
actual cases of
you know adolescents let's say who think
they have
500 friends
because there are 500 people on their
facebook account but these are the kind
of friends
whose
relation to you is that if you say you
know i bought a sandwich they say did it
taste good you know
that's a kind of interaction but
very different from having a real friend
you know somebody you can actually talk
to
and i think
so it has
it's a mixed story
i mean i don't you know don't say it's
bad but it makes things very different
actually i can
see it
you know i don't use the social media
but i can see the effects in my own
correspondence so i got a ton of
correspondence used to be
hard copy now
take a look this
very
very limited amount of uh hard cop you
know actual letters that people write so
it's mostly email
uh recently
i didn't notice it but bev pointed out
to me because she you know passes
through her before it reaches me she
cuts out a lot of junk
she pointed out that a lot of the
letters that are coming in there a lot
of our queries or comments or something
a lot of them are one sentence long
and she
concluded she's probably right that
these are from twitter
and if you look at the nature of those
one sentence letters
you can see most of the time it's
something that
you know came to somebody's mind and
somebody's you know walking down the
street have a thought and
send it out if they thought about it for
two minutes
they wouldn't have sent it
very commonly i get queries
you know somebody
they saw somebody saw something of mine
on
youtube
but it didn't of course if there's a
talk on youtube then they're a footnote
so they want to know you know why'd you
say this
well you know if they'd bothered to look
up something in print
they would have seen why i said that
and i often when they ask for source for
evidence i said well just take a look
and then
mention something you can read
that usually ends the conversation
the idea that you might want to read
something
like
that's too much can't do that
i'll often get
questions from say high school students
saying you know i i have to write a
paper and next thursday on uh
french revolution whatever it may be
what do i say and
i'll usually i tell them well you know
here's something you could look up
and the next question routinely comes
back how can i find it on the internet
and if i say
sometimes these come from like prep
schools
you know places with good libraries
educated students privileged students i
said well you know walk across the
street to the school library and look it
up
i don't have time you know
i want to be able to get it instantly on
the internet and not have to think about
it
well there's that phenomenon as well i
mean i'm not
offering this as a critique of the
internet it's just that
there are a lot of
factors involved
it's just it it does offer plenty of
possibilities
it also has it can have a kind of a
cheapening effect and i think both exist
and
it's true of everything say the same
about the printing press
well
my own feeling is that a corporation has
no right to have any
uh political or social influence
why should it you know
it's i mean i happen to agree with the
anti-government
uh
you know the anti-dictatorship
policies
but it's i don't think it's the role of
general electric uh
to support them or oppose them
now they do of course but i don't agree
with that
you know they're different they're
involved in producing different products
they're different kind of people running
them but
you know
there is uh
but but the principle is the same a
corporation is not shouldn't be have the
right i mean
under american law
as it's developed over the past century
uh corporations do have personal rights
but i think that's a
very negative development corporations
are
a corporation is a state-created
institution
state-supported institution
it's a concentration of private power
there's no reason why it should have the
rights of persons
i mean there are questions whether it
should even exist
like what who should corporations
be responsive to the management of a
corporation
i mean theoretically they're responsive
to the shareholders
but why not to the so-called
stakeholders
the workforce and the community i mean
perfect
nothing in economic theory opposes that
those are
the social and political decisions
yeah i don't think i mean it's true that
contemporary technology permits
forms of decentralization
uh it also permits uh centralization
it's uh
it depends how you use the technology
and there
look i mean contemporary technology
could be used for example
to
eliminate
uh
ownership and management of corporations
could be used to provide
say let's say a fact of manufacturing
let's say apple computers
in principle information technology
could be used
to provide
direct information to the workforce
uh
you know
on the ground so that they could
democratically decide what the
corporation would what the company would
do what the business would do
eliminating the role of management could
be used for that
and
people aren't developing technology for
that purpose they could be
i mean there are
groups that are talking about this
the participatory economics groups for
example but those are possibilities for
technology which
don't
you know don't tend to be used because
of the way power is concentrated
to all kinds of possibilities including
for coercion like in china technology is
used to
control and coerce
here too to an extent not to that extent
no it's not false the same hope is true
for the printing press
printing press had a very liberatory
effect
it meant that
individuals small groups could
produce
radical pamphlets could use them for
organizing
the levelers
you know in england 17th century were
made use of the printing
printing press opportunities that
weren't available elsewhere that desktop
publishing
was a big innovation it meant that
small groups or even poor societies
could
do their own publication without the
capital investment involved in major
printing presses that's a big difference
and the same is true of
more advanced technology
can offer plenty of liberatory
possibilities can
but whether it does or not or whether it
serves for coercion
it depends on socioeconomic decisions
well you know same mixed story i mean
some people a lot of association on the
internet
is a
highly constructive it's people
interacting that are changing ideas
making plans
coordinating activities
take any of the popular movements
they're all
a lot of the organization now is through
the internet
we're going to have a demonstration we
want to have a meeting
done through the internet on the other
hand i think that's all to the good
uh on the other hand a lot of the inter
uh probably
you know i thought of the percentage but
i'm sure the great mass of internet use
is uh
it's pretty superficial in interaction
among people
which is
not necessarily a bad thing i mean you
know
a teenager
wants to talk to her
friend that's fine but
it does it i think it probably
contributes to atomization
which is a threat to the society
there's a big difference between
tweeting to your friend
about something that's happening and
having
a real
personal relationship with people
and i think it probably has the effect
of
you know weakening
personal associations one of the
one of the real problems of the society
now
is it's far too atomized
what sociologists call secondary
associations
groupings that of people who get
together think things through you know
come out with plans and so on like
unions or true political organizations
they've
disintegrated
and people tend to be atomized it's uh
you get down to a society of
social units based on
an atom the atomic element which
consists of a person and it's
their computer that's not a society
that's going to
be able to
function freely and democratically
and
the tendency is there it doesn't have to
be but
it's something to worry about
