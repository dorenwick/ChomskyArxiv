Professor gome
Chomsky gome Chomsky is an Institute
professor and professor ameritus of
linguistics at MIT widely considered one
of the fathers of modern Linguistics

prominent critic of US foreign policy
and the nature of American support for
Israel in particular Professor chsky has

language on nature and language and the
forthcoming hopes and
Prospects I have always considered n
jsky a rare and refreshing source of
clarity especially regarding Palestine
Israel I think I speak for many of us
when I say N jski is a tremendous
personal inspiration and I cannot
imagine a speaker who would generate
more excitement on campus
please join me in welcoming Professor
Nome jsky
[Applause]
[Music]
thanks now we can go
home uh well uh let me Begin by giving
credit where credit is due to uh someone
I rarely Praise In fact I can't remember
when I ever have uh namely the Jerusalem
correspondent of the New York Times
Ethan
Bruner uh had a good column this morning
it's worth reading he's describing the
uh the mood in Israel on Independence
Day and he points out that the mood was
uh unu unusually Grim in fact maybe
uniquely so uh he refers to quite an
interesting letter that was written by
one of the major Israeli
correspondence arish shavit
in it's kind of a Centrist correspondent
very influential it's an open letter
from shavit to prime minister bamin
Netanyahu and he says you know we don't
really know each other but uh I know who
you are you know who I am and I never
write letters to people in the
government but the moment is so uh
significant and dangerous that I just
have to write you the letter and he has
a long open letter uh the letter says
that you Mr Netanyahu or maybe the most
hated person in the world in Israel the
left hates you the right hates you all
my friends hate you uh I'm the only
person who doesn't hate you and of
course all the Arabs hate you and
everyone in the United States hates you
and the rest of the world and so on and
he says the reason is because it's not
your fault he says you know I really
like you I think you're a nice guy but
uh Israel's face maybe the worst crisis
in its history and we have to do
something about it and then he runs
through the
crisis uh the worst one
he
uh is just the general attitude in the
world toward Israel well he didn't know
it but the day after his letter appeared
there was a poll an international poll
by the Pew Research Center uh which
incidentally Ethan Runner also refers to
in his column and the poll uh A ranked
was a global ranking of countries as to
what people think about them in many
countries and Israel ranked way down at
the bottom in fact right next to North
Korea almost at the very bottom and and
attitudes uh so the uh uh the concern is
Justified of course it's a lot of
paranoia and
self-righteousness the world doesn't
understand us everyone hates the Jews
right about everything but there's no
point just we can't go along just
knowing that we have to somehow do
something that'll convince the world uh
there are U some striking analogies
which Brunner didn't bring up uh one of
them is South Africa there are a lot of
analogies drawn between Israel and South
Africa most of them of pretty dubious
quality but one makes a lot of sense it
has to do with the history if you go
back back about 50 years the mood in
white nationalist South Africa was very
similar to this uh they uh they were
aware of it they were aware that they're
becoming a pariah Society uh they
reacted uh very much the way Israel is
reacting today large scale International
Information
Systems effort to explain to people it's
not propaganda it's explanation just as
it's called in Israel to explain explain
to them that everything we do is right
and just and highly moral and you should
understand it and so on and also kind of
circling the wagons a lot of
defiance shifts to the extreme
nationalist right uh right alter
nationalist movements and a lot more
it's all very similar uh about that time
about 50 years ago the South African uh
foreign minister uh in a conversation
with the American
ambassador told him that we know that uh
there
are strong resolutions in the United
Nations uh denouncing us passed by most
of the countries in the world but he
said that doesn't really matter and his
words were what matters more than all
other votes put together is the position
of the United States in view of its
predominant position of leadership in
the western world so in brief there's
only one vote in the United Nations
that's yours as long as you vote for us
the rest of them we don't care about uh
that was an accurate observation then
that's pretty much an accurate
observation today and it became much
more so in the case of South Africa as
the uh decolonization proceeded remember
this is
1960 decolonization proceeded and uh
protests International protests against
aparte grew more intense well actually
the US continued to support the the
history is informative the United States
continued to support South Africa the US
government the aparte regime uh right
through the period of mounting protests
at home too uh that continued right
through the Reagan years into the late
1980s uh Reagan had to at that time he
already had to evade Congressional s
sanctions against South Africa in order
to make sure the US trade increased as
it did and he also had to uh ignore even
business opposition which is a little
unusual by then the business World by
the late 70s early 80s the American
Business world was starting to disinvest
they didn't like what was happening they
thought they were they should get rid of
a part heide uh but Reagan overruled it
and it was no small matter uh in the uh
South African crimes with us support
dwarfed the crimes that Reagan was
responsible for in Central America and
the Middle East which were pretty
awesome but in South Africa was much
worse I mean just in the surrounding
countries Angola and mosambi the South
African depredations were responsible
for killing about a million and a half
people causing $60 billion of damage not
a small thing and the US government
government not the population not even
congress not even business but the
government continued to support it right
through now they had a reason and the
reason is familiar a justification the
justification was the war on
terror what we're told these days is
that George Bush declared the war on
terror in after 911 which is not quite
accurate he redeclared it Reagan had
declared it when he came into office in
1981 so a centerpiece of US foreign
policy is going to be uh State directed
International terrorism the plague of
the Modern Age you R return to barbarism
in our time and so on that's all been
wiped out of history for simple reason
Reagan's war on terror very quickly
turned into a massive terrorist war with
enormous destruction and atrocities and
that's not a good thing to maintain
within history so it's kind of Gone Away
except for the real world so when Bush
redeclared it the original had been
forgotten uh defense of South Africa was
justified by the war on terror uh
1988 uh the Pentagon uh declared that
the uh African National Congress Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress was
one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world that was 1988
after everything that had happened uh In
fairness I should say that a year ago
last May uh Mandela finally was removed
from the US terrorist list so he can now
travel to the United States without
special
dispensation uh but that was 1988 and in
fact the aparte regime looked
unassailable the foreign Minister's uh
uh analysis in 1950 was pretty accurate
as long as they had that one vote the
world could be
disregarded well right at that time for
reasons which aren't exactly known US
government policy shifted and within a
two or three years A Part heite had
collapsed was gone that's a a lot to say
about what followed not so beautiful but
it was certainly a major victory for
freedom and Justice well those are
important lessons worth keeping in mind
and it's worth keeping in mind that uh
virtually without exception uh Israeli
actions and Israeli policies are in fact
joint policies they're us Israeli
policies Israel can go just as far as
the US permits just as far as it
supports it and no further when Israel
doesn't does something the US doesn't
like tells them loud and clear and they
withdraw quietly doesn't matter who the
president is under George W bush there
were some extreme examples uh that's and
in fact Israel relies much more on the
United States for diplomatic military
and economic support than South Africa
did South Africa was getting support
from other terrorist States like Britain
and others uh Israel in particular but
uh the uh but Israel is really not it's
much more dependent on the United States
and it follows that any meaningful
change in of the relations between
Israel and Palestine is going to have to
be based on a change here in the United
States now there have been substantial
changes in past years so a meeting like
this say would have been
inconceivable as recently as 5 or 10
years ago in fact it wasn't long ago
that uh when I and a couple other people
tried to talk about these topics we
literally had to have police protection
and the meetings were broken up even my
own University MIT you the police
protection meetings were broken up
couldn't talk about it it's all
radically changed uh particularly since
the Gaza attack last year which made a
big shift in uh attitudes and
understanding uh and it also means that
actions are now feasible that weren't
even thinkable up until recently for
example the kind that were taken with
regard to South Africa after Decades of
uh education and protest took a long
time but by uh
1977 uh Hampshire College I think it was
the first one uh did pass a divestment
uh uh resolution and by the early ' 80s
as I say it was even Congressional
resolutions there a crucial example in
fact is is just that divestment from us
corporations that are involved in
criminal actions in the occupied
territories uh there's that focuses
right where it should on our activities
focuses on us that's what we should do
anyway your responsibility is yourself
not other people's crimes and it's also
the decisive Factor uh in what's going
to happen uh that's what we can
influence uh there is a brown group of
brown students for justice in Palestine
which is called for U divestment from us
corporations that are involved in
criminal actions in the occupied
territories so other words it's asking
Brown University to keep to the law
international law in fact domestic law
uh that the actions are criminal is not
really in question the uh wall the
so-called separation wall which AO we
called an annexation wall that cuts
through the West Bank um as many of you
I'm sure know that was subject to a u
decision by the uh by the world Court
the international court of justice which
uh unanimously including the US Justice
uh in a separate declaration unanimously
concluded that uh the Geneva
conventions apply to the occupied
territories the Geneva conventions very
explicitly bar any transfer of
population from the occupying power to
the U occupied territor so that means
any settlement anywhere in the occupied
territories is just illegal uh de facto
in violation of international criminal
law the US judge judge bergenthal
declared that includes every part of the
fence that goes into West Bank territory
roughly 85% of it which is is there not
to defend Israel but to defend settlers
who were there illegally so the walls
are legal and the same is true of every
other settlement with regard to
Jerusalem which is the area of extreme
contention now the actions are doubly
illegal not only in violation of
international law but even in violation
of very specific Security Council
resolutions which the US in fact U uh uh
agreed to back in the late 60s and the
early '70s when the United States was
still part of the world and this issue
departed in the mid '70s
uh but those resolutions still stand so
that's dull
criminality uh and it was understood in
Israel so in late 1967 right after the
June 67 War uh isra when question of
settlement in the occupied territories
was beginning to be brought up uh
Israel's top legal adviser
Theodor meon who's a very distinguished
International lawyer he's on the
international commissions you know human
rights commissions and so on he informed
the government that the Geneva
conventions clearly apply to the
occupied territories and that any
transfer of Israeli citizens there would
be in violation of fundamental
international law the Israeli attorney
general uh seconded that uh and
interestingly the person who was really
in charge of the occupied territories
mosha Dean he was defense minister but
he was responsible for what happened
there he agreed publicly he said yes
it's in violation of international law
but we're going to do it anyway because
countries violate international law all
the time so we will too and he was
basically correct he uh he probably not
consciously but he was essentially
repeating what the South African foreign
minister said as long as the master
agrees it doesn't matter if it's in
violation of law the master happens to
be a criminal State anyway uh and if it
authorizes criminal actions we're okay
doesn't matter what the law say and that
goes until today uh very strikingly in
fact rarely rarely even gets reported in
fact mostly doesn't but as I'm sure you
all know the big issue the big intern
ational issue is Iran and its possible
pursuit of nuclear weapons capability
and you know a lot of Hyster about that
Obama just made a big speech in which
presented a new nuclear posture and said
us promises not to attack not not to
carry out a first nuclear strike against
uh countries that don't have nuclear
weapons with an exception he said there
there are out liers and the main outlier
as we put it is Iran so we can carry out
a nuclear attack against them even
though they don't have nuclear weapons
uh right through this period you know
Security Council resolutions and so on
there are other things going on so the
international atomic energy agency uh
which is responsible for you know
monitoring the nonproliferation treaty
last September it passed a resolution
calling on Israel to join the
nonproliferation treaty and open its
facilities nuclear facilities to
inspection Europe and the United States
tried to block the resolution but they
failed and it passed anyway well it
didn't really matter it wasn't reported
in the United States or in England one
or two notices here and there uh also
unreported except for the uh Mooney
newspaper in Washington the Washington
Times was that Obama immedi mediately
informed Israel that it doesn't apply to
them so they can forget about it uh at
the same time the security Council
passed a resolution which got plenty of
publicity it was described as aimed at
Iran so it was good it called on all
states to join the nonproliferation
treaty and to uh settle their
disagreements uh within the framework of
the of the UN Charter and the the
nonproliferation treaty meaning by
peaceful means well those Provisions
were directed against the United States
now there's only two countries in the
world that are threatening the use of
force which is also criminal take a look
at the UN Charter which bars the threat
or use of force and international
Affairs but across the Spectrum in the
United States the threat of force is
considered legitimate and often the use
of force so yes it's a criminal State
across across the Spectrum uh and so the
US and Israel are the only countries
that are threatening the use of force
and in fact preparing for it uh so well
they'll do it who knows but uh without
report here the United States has
recently sent uh to the island of Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean uh has sent
uh submarine tenders to care for nuclear
submarines the nuclear submarines are
undetectable and they can carry nuclear
weapons and it has Al also sent to Diego
Garcia um the biggest bombs in the US
Arsenal short of nuclear weapons what
are called massive ordinance penetrators
bunker Busters they're called they're
AED specifically at Iran nobody else
there a huge 13 ton bombs which are
supposed to be able to penetrate deep
into the Earth through you know
thousands of tons of reinforced concrete
it doesn't get reported here but of
course it's known to Iranian
intelligence and it's supposed to be
it's a threat of force actually the
Diego Garcia uh the re Diego Garcia is
an island which isn't talked about much
but it's crucial to us uh International
aggression it's the major base for the
bombing of the Middle East and Central
Asia and so on that's it's actually was
a British Island the British expelled
the
population uh on orders of the
master uh they appeal to be returned and
won in British courts but as Diane said
law doesn't matter if the master says no
so they can't return Diego Garcia is
part of Africa uh the African Union just
a couple of months ago established a
nuclear weapons free zone if anybody
were really interested in stopping
nuclear limiting nuclear proliferation
what they'd be doing is supporting
nuclear weapons-free zones around the
world well Africa finally had one but
they can't
implemented because of Diego Garcia the
United States and Britain loyally
trailing behind refused to allow the
nuclear-free
uh uh treaty to apply to Diego Garcia
because they intend to use it they do
use it for storing nuclear weapons and
might use it for attacking the
outliers that's inly not the only case
there's also a South Pacific nuclear
weapons free zone which also isn't
implemented because the US insists on
excluding the Pacific Islands which are
used
for BA bases where the US stores nuclear
weapons nuclear submarines and so on so
that's not implemented uh come back to
another important nuclear weapons free
zone in a moment anyway the outlier is
Iran now actually there are three
countries that have not ever signed the
nonproliferation treaty new nuclear
States uh Israel India and Pakistan all
developed nuclear weapons with us
support and are still doing so uh
Pakistan it's one of Ronald Reagan's
gifts to the world uh India it's
accelerated in the last couple of years
uh there's an under Bush that was a uh
us Indian treaty signed which is in
direct violation of all the
international conventions on non eration
it permits India to develop nuclear
weapons in secret and it permits the us
to help them by providing them with
nuclear technology now the story is it's
for civilian use but everybody knows
that the boundary between civilian use
and military application is quite small
and furthermore even providing it for
civilian use permits India to divert uh
uh uh its technology and research to
nuclear weapons as in fact it's doing
quite openly so immediately after the
security Council resolution I mentioned
India announced though it wasn't
reported here that it can produce
nuclear weapons with the same yield as
the superpowers the US and Russia Obama
quietly informed India that the security
Council resolution doesn't apply to them
uh Pakistan responds to India so they're
openly in fact developing new nuclear
weapons
facilities uranium enrichment and so on
those are the real threats of nuclear
weapons in the region the three
countries that refuse to sign the treaty
and that are backed by the US when they
openly defy the security Council the
international atomic energy agency and
so on not the out the outlier may be a
problem but that's a US issue and so the
US is not supported by the world on this
contrary to what you read so the call
for
sanctions what you read is Iran is
defying the International Community
International Community is a term that
has a rather technical meaning it refers
to Washington and whoever happens to
agree with it at the moment so the
International Community excludes the
majority of states in the world the
nonline former nonline movement which
vigorously support Iran's right to uh
develop uh uh nuclear power develop as
permitted under the nonproliferation
treaty everyone agrees it excludes uh
China and Russia it excludes India which
is opposed to sanctions excludes Brazil
which is pointedly opposed to sanctions
turkey the one major Middle East pow
doesn't want sanctions in fact even the
Arab League which the US is supposedly
catering to they just had a meeting and
uh declared their opposition ition to
sanctions call for diplomacy but
nevertheless the International Community
U steadfastly insists on higher
sanctions inly the American people
aren't part of the International
Community I haven't seen a recent poll
May opinion may have changed after all
the propaganda the last couple of years
but in uh 2007 a considerable majority
of Americans agreed with the world
outside the International Community that
is agreed that
uh Iran has a right same right as
everyone else uh to develop nuclear
energy well there the outliers there was
a meeting in Taran of uh 60 States
couple of days ago it's very hard to
find out who was there because nothing's
covered but there was a meeting and they
came out with a declaration calling for
an end to any nuclear weapons and they
called for establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
that's an interesting
proposal uh in this case the US
population is overwhelmingly in support
of it and so is just everyone in the
world who's ped at least very strong
support for a nuclear weapons free zone
uh that would mitigate and maybe
terminate whatever the alleged threats
are of Iran developing a nuclear weapons
capability they just called for it in
the Taron meeting I don't think it was
reported here uh there are two countries
that have a
particularly uh deep commitment to this
namely the United States and Britain the
reason is because when the US and
Britain invaded Iraq they tried to
provide a kind of a thin legal cover for
it and the way they did it was by
appealing to a security Council
resolution resolution 687 in 1991
which called on Iraq to dismantle its
weapons of mass destruction and the US
and Britain claimed they hadn't done it
we know that was false but that was the
claim and that justified their invasion
of Iraq well if you bother reading that
resolution you'll see that it commits
the signers to establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East uh
so the US and Britain over above all
others have a commitment to this and if
there was a real interest in
nonproliferation instead of just
rhetorical that's what would be pursued
well going back to Israel which is not
the only beneficiary of us criminality
India and Pakistan are too uh but in the
case of Israel they're immune from uh uh
the international atomic energy agency
Security Council and in fact a long
record of us vetos of Security Council
resolutions that uh uh charge Israel
with one or another crime actually the
US veto's resolution charging itself
with crimes too if we had a free
education system in the United States
everyone would know that the United
States is the only country that has
rejected a world Court
decision in the past it was one of
three uh Libya and Albania also hadn't
accepted them but they've since accepted
them so the US is in Splendid isolation
uh that was a world Court decision
calling on the United States to
terminate its uh a terrorist war against
Nicaragua of course Cally
rejected that went to the security
Council there were two resolutions uh
calling on the all states didn't mention
the US calling on all states to observe
international law the us vetoed both of
them uh France and Britain politely
abstained so there are are outliers in
the world but uh you know Iran's got an
awful government nobody doubts that but
there are other outliers maybe more
significant one certainly more
significant for us well uh it's kind
going back to Israel Palestine it's kind
of uh strange on the surface that the
conflict
persists why does it why is it called
unresolvable you know toughest problem
in the world I mean there are plenty of
problems in the world where it's hard
even to conjure up a solution ution to
imagine one in this case you can not
only conjure it up but everyone knows
what it is and furthermore the whole
world agrees to it outside of the United
States and Israel in fact it's even got
international law on its side supported
by the Arab League it's supported by the
organization of Islamic States including
Iran it's in supported by the relevant
non-state actors like Hamas uh the
resolution is it it the basic Contours
are very well known
uh two-state settlement on the
international border pre-june 67 border
uh perhaps with minor and mutual
modifications that was the official US
term back in the late 60s and early 70s
before the US departed from the world on
this issue so settlement on the
international border was a ceasefire
line so kind of messy with minor and
mutual modifications and various
conditions about Jerusalem refugees and
so on well well that's a uh solution but
much like the nuclear free weapons free
zone there's a barrier and it's right
here the US won't accept it and as long
as the US doesn't accept it Israel feels
entirely free to continue to violate it
now that's been going on since the
mid-70s in
1976 January 76 the uh major Arab states
brought a resolution to the security
Council a calling for a settlement
roughly in these terms uh recognizing
the rights of every state in the region
including Israel to live in peace and
security within recognized boundaries
and all the standard diplomatic
terminology uh it was vetoed by the
United States uh again in 1980 record in
general assembly is um similar uh a veto
by the United States is in fact a double
veto maybe a triple veto first of all it
doesn't happen and secondly it's vetoed
from reporting and third is vetoed from
history so you have to look pretty hard
to find find out much about this that's
what it means to have overwhelming power
those are some of the prerogatives
overwhelming power and a very obedient
intellectual class which keeps things
quiet you know doesn't make sure that
young minds aren't uh distorted by
knowing too much about the world uh the
uh uh but in fact in this entire record
of 35 years of us rejectionism there's
one exception and a very Illuminating
one it's in 2000 year 2000 it's not the
one people talk about uh everyone talks
about the camp David uh negotiations
which failed but that wasn't the end of
it uh after the collapse of of the Camp
David negotiations President Clinton
recognized that the US Israeli position
at the negotiations could not be
accepted by any Palestinians even the
most uh you know what are called
moderate ones Pro us ones uh so Clinton
and December of 2000 issued what he
called his parameters they were kind of
vague but somewhat more
forthcoming he then said that both sides
Israel and the Palestinians had accepted
his parameters both sides had had uh U
made reservations to them well they met
in taba Egypt in January
2001 uh to NE to try to iron out the
differences the reservations and they
made quite a bit of success in their
last press conference we we know a lot
about this it was internationally
monitored there's extensive reports from
Israel most of it in Hebrew but some in
English so we know quite a lot about it
uh they practically reached agreement in
their last press conference they said if
they had a few more days they could have
reached agreement on every issue pretty
much in line with the international
consensus you know tweaking it here and
there there were few issues still uh
Israel called off the negotiations
prematurely and that was the end of
formal
negotiations uh informal pretty high
level negotiations continued leading to
some agreements the main ones called the
Geneva Accord it was uh rejected by
Israel ignored by the United States so
that's down the tube uh all of this is
quite significant it means that uh a
resolution in terms of the international
consensus is feasible uh if the United
States will permit it uh unfortunately
there's very little sign of that well
meanwhile U the US and Israel are just
extending and deepening the illegal
occupation
in uh 2005 September August September
2005 um uh Israel made a sensible
tactical decision the right-wing
government Ariel sheron's decision
government decided that it doesn't make
any sense to keep 7 or 8,000 Israeli
settlers in the Gaza Strip which by then
had been half destroyed uh taking you
know maybe a third or more of the
resources in land and protected by you
know half the Israeli Army so he made
the decision to transfer the settlers
illegally settling in the Gaza Strip to
the West Bank which is much more
important uh now it could have been done
just like
that just flick of a wrist you know but
they decided to Stage what they what was
called a national
trauma so there was a huge trauma
perfectly completely farsal uh if the if
they'd want to do it quietly all I had
to do was announce that on August 1st
the IDF the Israeli Army is going to
leave the Gaz of strip at that point the
8,000 settlers would have climbed into
the buses provide trucks provided to
them and they would leave their
subsidized homes in the Gaza Strip to
subsidized homes in the West Bank but
you don't get any propaganda out of that
what they wanted was a trauma uh so it
was staged you know big front P pictures
on the front pages of you know little
boy pleading with the soldiers not the
destroy his home you know Boston Globe
and so on and shouts of never again and
so you know no more holocausts and it
was pretty effective actually it was a
it was a farsal repeat of a similar
stage trauma in 1982 when they had to uh
depart take settlers out of Egypt out of
the northeastern Shai there were
commentators in Israel who just
ridiculed it correctly like the late one
of Israel's leading sociologists bar
Kimberling died recently
wrote just just ridiculed the farce as
it should have been done but it played
it played where it mattered here so
never again we've got to hold on to the
Occupy of the West Bank well uh after
the withdrawal from technical withdrawal
from Gaza Israel maintained its total
control uh and it was pretty vicious it
picked up in intensity a couple of
months later when the Palestinians
committed a serious crime there was a
free election in Palestine in January
2006 and they voted the wrong way now
that's not acceptable you can do all
kind of things but not that uh you don't
vote the wrong way in a free election so
the US quite openly Israel too of course
uh uh turned to punishing the
Palestinians for this crime and it
wasn't secret like you can read it in a
column on the front page of the New York
Times right alongside another column
which is lauding our
magnificent Messianic pursuit of
wilsonian ideals and supporting
democracy and so on there's no
contradiction or well you may recall had
a concept which you call Double think uh
double think is the capacity to have two
contradict ictory ideas in mind at the
same time and believe both of them uh
that's almost a definition of the
intellectual culture but this was a
dramatic case and immediately after that
crime the punishment of the Gaza Strip
sharply increased got worse later I
won't go through the details but uh it's
pretty awful uh very Savage Siege
brutality and so on it
peaked December 19
2008 with the latest us Israeli Invasion
which was murderous and destructive uh
The Invasion uh the US is it's called an
Israeli Invasion it's a US Israeli
Invasion us arms us diplomatic support
and so on uh it it it was given a
pretext but every active aggression has
a pretext so you have to ask does it
mean anything actually the pretext was
that U Israel was defending itself
against rockets from Gaza uh that
pretext is accepted by the human rights
groups by the Goldstone commission by
about 100% of commentary it doesn't have
a particle of credibility Israel and the
US knew exactly how to stop the Rockets
there had been a ceasefire and during
the ceasefire Israel admits there was
not a single Hamas rocket Israel
violated the ceasefire a couple of
months earlier and the rocket started
Hamas called for renewing the ceasefire
Israel considered it and refused well
you know the use of force when you
haven't exhausted even tried peaceful
means is just pure it's just major war
crimes I mean the discussion about the
war crimes in gas is Trivial in
comparison so Israel in fact got a free
pass from the Goldstone report and
others well since then the savagery
continues I won't go on the details I'm
talking too long it's pretty similar in
the West Bank um the restrictions are
uh not quite as not as severe in the
West Bank as they are in Gaza which has
become basically unlivable that's the
point but they're bad uh but Israel has
finally understood in the West Bank that
it should do what every colonial power
has done don't punish the entire
population uh ensure that the Elites are
making out fine you go to any third
world country you know under colonial
rule or neocolonial Rule and there's a
sector of wealth and privilege which is
you know beyond anything that we dream
of and Israel's finally understood that
that's what you do so if you go to rala
you can go to elegant restaurants and uh
you know go to the theater it's just
like being in Paris and London you go a
couple of miles away and it's horrible
but uh uh that allows the the
journalists and others to talk about the
wonderful achievements in the West Bank
well when you running in fact Israel is
following finally the explicit
recommendation of Israeli industrialists
about 10 years ago who urged that Israel
should move from what their words from
uh colonialism to
neocolonialism it should establish the
standard neocolonial
structures like this took a long time to
realize it but they're doing it uh in
fact that's becomes even more like South
Africa South Africa relied on the banto
stands and it tried to keep them they
wer they were pretty awful but it tried
to keep them viable it needed them that
was their labor force uh so they kept
them going they tried to get
International recognition for them but
outside Israel no country recognized
them uh but uh that's uh Israel is not
doing it for all the West Bank it's uh
just doing it for the elite sector in
remala where the Palestinian Authority
is uh well if you want to maintain a
neocolonial system you have to have a an
iron fist see you need military force
and there is one it's called it's the
Army run by General Keith Dayton
actually that's the more mild of the
military forces but the better known one
uh US general run an army trained in
Jordan with us Israeli participation and
support and it keeps a grip over the
population in fact uh Obama the Obama
Administration was particularly
impressed by how well the Army worked
during the attack on Gaza during the
attack on Gaza there were no protests in
the West Bank which kind of surprised
everyone and that's attributed to the
power of the Dayton Army which prevented
any protests so Palestinians were of
course they can't demonstrate or
anything but they were not even allowed
to protest uh the destruction of the
other half of Palestine what's going on
in Gaza John Kerry in particular head of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
was particularly impressed with this he
said finally he said Israel may have a
legitimate partner for peace uh thanks
to the success of the uh General Dayton
Army and suppressing the population
sufficiently so they can't even protest
against massive atrocities well let's
turn finally to the options for
Palestinians what are they uh here the
discussion I think is pretty misleading
and you should think it through uh one
option of course is the international
consensus and there's a barrier the US
won't accept it uh but that's our
problem now a very common view you hear
it all over the place now from
Palestinians from Israeli d
from the you know supporters of
Palestinians here uh that the
alternative to that is that Israel takes
over the territories it becomes a single
state and you can have a civil rights
struggle an anti-ar heite struggle
within this single state in which
Palestinians will be roughly half the
population and that's many um of the
does including Palestinian leaders think
okay that's better than uh the Vanishing
to State settlement there's only one
problem with that logic those are not
the two Alternatives there's a third
alternative which isn't discussed the
third alternative is that the US and
Israel continue doing exactly what
they're
doing and what they're doing is very
clear has a name prime minister ahmer
called it convergence what you do what
Israel with us backing is doing is
taking over everything be annexing
everything behind the separation wall
some of the most valuable land all the
Water Resources that's quite crucial in
this arid region that takes over the
Jordan Valley you know more fertile
territory kicks out the
Palestinians uh and runs some Sant uh
settlement alence right through the
territories actually there three of them
big one east of Greater Jerusalem
Jerusalem's been sharply expanded
there's one that goes almost to Jericho
and two others to the north one taking
in the town of Ariel the other town of
kadum you take a look at a map and if
you look at a map it looks it doesn't
penetrate too deeply into the West Bank
but that's misleading because the area
where it doesn't penetrate is mostly
Rocky desert where you can't settle the
livable part of the West Bank is broken
up into four major cantons what Ariel
chaon in fact the architect of this
called the banto STS he was honest
except that they're not cared for as
well as the banto STS so Israel will
take those no demographic problem no pal
very few Palestinians if there are a few
you kick them out uh no problem of too
many non-jews in a Jewish State no civil
rights Struggle No apar height struggle
as for the Palestinians they can rot up
in the hills Israel takes no
responsibility for them they can follow
a proposal of uh mosha Dian back in ' 67
the defense minister was in charge he
said we should tell the Palestinians
that we have no solution for you uh
we're going to you're going to live like
dogs and whoever wants to leave can
leave and we'll see where that goes well
yeah that's the policy and that's the
real alternative to a two-state
settlement there is no alternative of
the kind that's being discussed because
neither Israel nor the United States or
in fact anyone in the world is going to
accept that uh rather they'll continue
doing exactly what they're doing
now that's not going to change unless
there are changes inside the United
States as in the current world scen it's
hard to see wherever where
else changes could come from and uh
that's kind of an optimistic conclusion
for us uh for people who oppose current
US Israeli policies because here is the
one place where we can influence what
happens and here is the one place that
matters that's where there going to make
it a decisive difference now there are
implications for tactical choices I
think they should be pretty obvious but
uh I'll stop there sorry to have gone on
too long
[Applause]
[Music]
take a look at the history of apar heide
it's suggestive not exact but suggestive
took Decades of education and organizing
things things like this before uh the
situation in the United States reached
the point where Congress the business
world you know general population was so
opposed to aarte that the Reagan
administration had to lie its way around
it
uh to try to keep to maintain the
support well okay that's one thing that
could be done another thing that could
be done is what began in the case of
South Africa and the late 70s uh namely
divestment um by then it already had the
support of uh a large part of the
population including even businesses and
pretty soon Congress uh but the
requirement that us corporations divest
from uh white nationalist uh firms in
South Africa which they themselves are
already beginning to do Under Pressure
here okay that can be done now that's uh
and you can go beyond um there were a
number of U International reports about
the Gaza uh attack one of the most
important was from Amnesty
International not exactly an extremist
organization uh they called on the
United States to withhold all armed
shipments from Israel saying that the
armed shipments violate international
law which they do and they even violate
us domestic law armed shipments are
supposed to be subject to the condition
that they are used only for defensive
purposes or for you know internal
security and the Gaza attack was had no
defensive purpose as I mentioned and
certainly wasn't for internal security
and they were used in commission of
Major Crimes crime of aggression lots of
other war crimes so there could be a
popular movement here to call on the US
government to live up to its own laws
and to terminate arm shipments and
there's lot of other things you know so
there's no shortage of things that we
can
do thank you um well you know it's no
deep secret I mean like we're doing
right now uh how did people just take a
look at the change just take the recent
years in the United States you can go
all the way back in history but how or
go back further how was slavery overcome
uh H how did women get the right to vote
you know how in the since the 1960s were
women's rights pretty substantially
established not perfect but totally
different from anything before uh how
were civil rights achieved how did
environmental concerns begin to be
addressed not well enough but at least
somewhat and every step forward in
history comes the same way and people
like you do something about it and
there's it's a very free country you can
do all sorts of things you're people in
universities are extremely privileged uh
students for example are in the moment
of their lives when they are most free
they're sort of out of parental control
they don't yet have the burdens imposed
on them to try to survive in a society
where incomes for the majority of
stagnation for 30 years because of
government corporate policies so they
don't so they're kind of free they do
lots of things that others don't have a
choice about okay do them yeah that's
fine I think that's one of the things
you can do but there's plenty more I
mean we all know that a vote doesn't
mean much thank you it doesn't a vote
yeah I mean in more democratic countries
than ours uh that's understood like take
say the poorest country in South America
Bolivia I mean they had a pretty
remarkable
election 2005 another one just last year
uh in which the majority of the
population
indigenous uh people the most repressed
people in the continent uh had by then
organized enough to enter the political
Arena and vote somebody from their own
ranks you know not some rich guy from
you know went to Skull and Bones Yale
but they've elected someone from their
own ranks they formulated the programs
which the president is following serious
programs and the voting was just one
moment in an ongoing struggle you know
it wasn't I go to the polls I push a
button and I forget about it for the
next four years it was there's just an
ongoing popular struggle about all kind
of serious issues you know access to
water
control of
resources comple complex questions of U
ethnic and civil rights in a complex
society and they're at it all day all
the time okay that's functioning
democracy we've got a long way to go but
we've had it in the past but it's kind
of been suppressed and it can be
recovered uh and that's what elections
ought to be just a moment in a process
which goes on from there
hi um first thank you so much for coming
I've learned a lot listening to um what
you shared with us my question is
specifically about um Iran and the
nuclear weapons and the discussion that
you were having with regard to Iran and
the International Community um I
definitely understand the idea of a
country obtaining a nuclear weapon or
developing one themselves out of a form
of protection or to be on the same I
guess International status as other
countries who are considered superpowers
on the same level as a superpower
because they themselves have nuclear
weapons but what do you do when a
country is openly trying to develop one
or obtain one and also open open openly
threatening to wipe out a country and
claiming that a country shouldn't exist
I mean those are two really big issues
that we're dealing with and I didn't
really think you address that and I was
curious what you have to say well what
do you do about countries that already
develop nuclear weapons outside the
framework of the nonproliferation treaty
and are daily violating resolutions of
the security Council and the
international atomic energy agency I
that's the much more serious problem but
that's a different situation because
that those countries aren't openly
threatening to wipe out another country
nor is Iran just take a look at the
statements the statements are that they
don't think they said in the actually
goes back toi at the time of the US
Iranian Alliance the Israeli Iranian
Alliance and Israel didn't care about it
then and it keeps being repeated the
statement is that you know in the course
of time uh Israel should no longer exist
well actually I happen to agree with
that too facts so to a lot of people in
Israel the ones who think there should
be a single Democratic State that's not
calling for wiping anyone out in fact
Iran has supported the uh International
consensus on the two-state settlement uh
actually there is there are two
countries that are not not only calling
for some Nation not to exist but are
destroying it namely the US and Israel
that's their position with regard to the
Palestinians and they're not just saying
[Applause]
it I stress they're not just saying it
they're doing it day by day that's the
meaning of the policies that are going
on right before our eyes in Gaza and the
West Bank
which we are supporting and paying for
so sure you shouldn't call for the
destruction of another nation and you
shouldn't Implement that actually the
official position of Israel backed by
the United States they've slightly
modified it but back about 20 years ago
their official
position the coalition government labor
leud was that there cannot be I'm
quoting it an additional Palestinian
State between Jordan and Israel
in other words they declared and the US
supported that that there already is a
Palestinian State namely Jordan I mean
the Palestinians object you know they
say no wait a minute that's not our
state but who cares about them we say
that's your state and there can't be an
additional one well that goes well
beyond calling for the destruction of
another country I mean it's it's
analogous to saying that uh if somebody
came along suppose Ahmad and the Jud
said Jews don't need Israel because they
already have New York okay I mean you
know we'd call that a Revival of Nazism
but that's the official you has been the
official US Israeli position so there's
a lot to be incidentally about Iran uh
nobody in their right mind wants Iran to
have nuclear weapons or anyone else but
it is well and it's a horrible regime
undoubtedly though there are worse ones
in the region which are our allies uh
but uh every everyone uh I'm not
referring to Israel I'm referring to the
other Arab State I mean comparison with
Saudi Arabia Iran looks like a civil
rights Paradise but uh the uh but it's
awful you know no doubt uh and and
there's a way to deal with it like for
example moving towards a nuclear
weapons-free Zone but uh among strategic
analysts including Israeli ones there is
no
real uh there's no real question about
why Iran is moving to nuclear weapons
capability which is not the same as
having nuclear weapons it's just being
at a point where you could have them
like most of the advanced industrial
world is in that
position you know Japan Italy all sorts
of countries uh the reason is very
simple actually it was described by uh
one of Israel's leading U um military
analysts very hawkish uh Martin F
crefeld A couple of years ago after the
invasion of Iraq he wrote an article in
which he said he doesn't know if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons and he hopes
not but he says if they're not
developing nuclear weapons they are
crazy that was his word they're not
developing they're crazy the United
States has just announced uh we're going
to attack anybody we feel like and
invade you if we can do it with impunity
so you better have a
deterrent well maybe they're developing
a deterrent uh no serious analyst thinks
that they could use nuclear weapons if
Iran had nuclear weapons and missiles
which nobody say wants them to have I
mean if they went as far as even loading
a missile the country would be
vaporized you know instantly even if
there was any suspicion of it well you
know the clerics may be hideous people
but they've shown no particular
inclination for suicide and destruction
of everything that they own and
everything they value uh same is true
about leaking nuclear weapons to others
if there was any suspicion that they
were doing that you can say goodbye to
Iran so chances they're using it or you
know probably at the level of an
asteroid hitting the Earth or something
like that uh but uh it's a serious
problem in fact if you look at the
Israeli
literature they're pretty straight about
it they say that the the real threat of
an Iranian nuclear weapon is not against
Israel but it's against
Zionism that is what they're afraid of
is that if the region becomes too
dangerous people in Israel are just
going to
leave you people who have the capacity
to more educated wealthier and so on
because they won't want to live in a
region with that threat and in fact
immigration is a pretty serious problem
immigration of the educated and the uh
you the trained educated sectors so they
don't want to face that threat it but I
don't think any serious strategic
Analyst at least I've never seen one who
uh thinks that this's the threat that
Iran might use a nuclear weapon I mean
dude total
suicide thank
you first thank you and uh good evening
Dr chamski um my question is concerning
the uh well just getting information how
do we how do we inform the intellectual
classes where do you find your
information and how do you
you how do you access truth in in a
media that's so uh corrupt and overtaken
by corporate interests just how do you
become a good biologist you work you
know I mean you know that the important
results aren't like written in bold face
I mean you know the best biologist is
not somebody who read all the technical
papers there are can't do that they have
to know what to look for and I have to
like take say the some of the things I
mentioned like the U International
atomic energy agency resolution on
Israel that I mentioned well I was lucky
I happened to be in Mexico last
September and they have happen to have
an independent newspaper in Mexico it's
the only one in the Western Hemisphere
that I know of very good newspaper you
know big newspaper second largest in
Mexico gets no commercial advertising
because business won't advertise there
but they subscri they uh they do very
well just on reader support and they
happened while I was there they happened
to run an Associated Press piece on this
well you know I didn't know whether to
believe it or not so when I came home I
checked up Associated Press which is on
the internet and yeah it's true uh then
U you know I did a media search and I
found out that there was one mention of
it in the United States in the Mooney
paper in Washington the Washington Times
there also one in the United Kingdom in
the Irish Times okay that's the kind of
thing you got to do uh on all sorts of
issues I this if you know what you're
looking for and you're willing to uh put
the effort into it you can find out a
lot of things now for an individual it's
extremely hard you have to be kind of a
fanatic but if you're in a group you
know if you're part of an organization
it gets a lot easier I mean that's one
of the advantages of joining with other
people you can do a lot of things you
can't do by yourself so somebody finds
something you disseminate it you know
others help out and pretty soon you get
things done and one more thing if you
could just quickly repeat the uh the
column you
mentioned in the beginning of your of
your talk oh uh the the this morning's
New York Times Ethan Brunner thanks who
I think is a terrible correspondent but
he happen to have a good he happen to
have a good column this morning good
honest column he also did his homework
he dug up the shavit article which I
didn't expect it's on I don't think it's
in English so it's in Hebrew I believe
and he also dug up that International
poll which I haven't seen you reported
anywhere so thanks for coming again um I
recently watched the I guess the classic
video of you with William F Buckley
debating the Vietnam War back in the 60s
um and so I feel like you've been asked
probably every question underneath the
Sun
so um I guess my question would be what
what does n Chomsky now wish uh that
gome Chomsky back when he was debating
Buckley in the 60s what is what do he
wish he knew and if you could also
indulge us uh what is your uh happiest
moment in
[Applause]
life I don't answer personal questions
there are
some um well I I don't actually remember
I think that debate was in ' 69 so I
can't remember it in any detail but
looking back at the period in general my
main regret is I was much too mild I
mean what I should have been called
taking a much stronger position I mean
Buckley seem would disagree with that he
would disagree yeah but if I was having
a debate with some Soviet commissar and
I criticized what Russia was doing he'd
say it's too harsh you
but maybe you have to remember that it
was not easy then in
retrospect the sort of fairy tale is
that everyone was opposed to the war
that's absolutely untrue I mean in the
early stages of the war in Vietnam it
was much harder to talk about than it is
to talk about Israel Palestine today I
mean the as late as uh October
1965 that's three years after Kennedy
had launched a major war against the
south in fact the South's practically
destroyed uh we tried to have our first
public meeting in Boston Boston's pretty
liberal City and there's a place in
downtown Boston the Boston Common which
is you know dedicated to open meetings
so we figured okay we'll take a chance
and have a public meeting on the Boston
Common criticizing the war very mild
criticisms I mean it was broken up by
students if it wasn't that there were
couple hundred State Police there we
probably all would have been killed the
Boston Globe you know the liberal
newspaper huge denunciation how dare you
stand up and criticize our magnificent
government and so on uh it took a long
time before uh uh any kind of a peace
movement developed and then if you look
at how it developed in fact you can read
this today in your history books and in
the press and so on uh what developed
was
quite different in the elite culture and
in the popular culture if you look at
the elite culture which you're going to
read in history book or you know in the
newspapers and so on was that there was
a debate over uh whether the war was
winnable or not okay in fact when people
make analogies to Afghanistan you know
or Iraq they say well you know is is it
winnable I mean that's like a debate in
the Nazi General stat Chef after
Stalingrad you know did did Hitler make
a mistake in opening a two-front war you
know should we have knocked out England
first I mean that's the kind of debate
that takes place here now decades after
the Vietnam War try to find check and
see you know history book press journals
uh a debate over whether it was simply a
monstrous crime the kind of crime for
which Nazis were hanged at
nberg go on I mean and same today I mean
take say Obama he's considered a
principled opponent of the Iraq War you
know a lot of Praise what was his
criticism his criticism was that it was
a strategic
blunder like Nazi generals after
Stalingrad or what you could read in
Pravda 1985 when a lot of people were
saying openly I was strategic blunder to
invade Afghanistan we don't call that
principled critique when others do it I
mean we call that uh you know
criminal but to try to look at ourselves
is extremely hard I mean not just in the
United States almost anywhere your own
history is
whitewashed consistently I mean we even
do it in personal life If we're honest
it's pretty hard to look in the mirror
but it's crucial if you want to
understand the world and it's crucial
for the entire world World in our case
because the US is so
powerful you don't want to answer my
second question pardon you don't want to
answer my second question sure uh what's
your happiest moment in life happy that
one as I said I'm not going to
answer you just have a clam chowder or
something that's fine pardon you just
can say clam chowder no a lot happier
than
[Applause]
that hello thank you again for coming to
speak to us today was very informative
um in your talk you discussed the
importance of the Geneva conventions
today and setting an appropriate
standard and code of conduct and
behavior in international Affairs and
especially in times of conflict um you
used the Geneva conventions and then you
applied it to Israel especially in their
last um Gaza war and some of the actions
that Israel's in the past I want to ask
your opinion do you think that these
same conventions and standard should be
applied to Hamas even though they are
non-state actor and don't have
conventional military forces and also do
you think the Geneva conventions need to
be adopted today for a question of
asymmetric Warfare well on the second I
don't see any reason
whatsoever why the Geneva conventions
should be modified for what we call
asymmetric Warfare asymmetric Warfare
refers to our invasions of other
countries and uh resistance to the
invasions by people who are weaker we
didn't call it asymmetric Warfare when
uh uh we were supporting uh radical
islamists to try to drive the Russians
out of
Afghanistan okay we didn't call the
partisans in Europe asymmetric Warfare
when they were fighting the Nazis
asymmetric Warfare means when somebody
tries to defend themselves against us or
our clients and there's no reason now
why the Geneva conventions have to be
changed for that any more than there
were when the Nazis killed the partisans
you know so the question no as far as
Hamas is concerned Hamas is a political
party okay and I you can't really apply
international law to a political party
you can uh say that actions of a
criminal of a political party are
criminal right and some of hamas's
actions are criminal so sure if for
example take say the Amnesty
International report I mentioned it
didn't just say we should stop supplying
arms to Israel
it said we should stop applying arms to
Israel and
Hamas well we don't Supply arms to Hamas
but if we were doing it we should stop
okay uh so sure same standard should
apply uh uh but uh it's just you know
it's so fantastically disproportionate
that it's almost meaningless to raise
the question I mean if Hamas for example
says we'll never recognize
Israel okay
that's there's political party has a
right to say that I mean if political
party in Mexico says I'm never going to
recognize the United States which sits
on half of Mexico obtained by Conquest
it's a legitimate position uh the ruling
party in Israel leud happens to have as
its platform you can pick it up on the
internet its official platform is there
cannot be a Palestinian State anywhere
in what they call the land of Israel you
know Jordan to the Sea
okay it's a kind of like hamas's program
plan nobody talks about it because they
are Ally and clients so they can say
whatever they want you know and they're
not only talking about it they're doing
it but sure uh if Hamas fires rockets at
St root we should stop helping them do
that and in fact we should take actions
to prevent them from doing it and we
know what the actions are except the
ceasefire when the US and Israel did
accept the ceasefire the Rockets stopped
and that's officially conceded you can
read it on the Israeli government
website official
website so sure we should take actions
to prevent criminal acts by substate
actors thank you very much
sorry I know my name is David Target I'm
one of the Deans here and uh uh I um
wanted to answer the question that some
students had about um
uh how what we what we can do about um
the various political situations that
we're hearing about and actually the
answer to that question lies right here
in this room um 18 years ago the East
teamour Action Network um established if
its kind of core here uh at an event
that took place in Solomon 101 uh When
Alan Nar and a journalist and Amy
Goodman another journalist uh had come
here to talk about um uh a recent
massacre in East Tour um one of the last
massacres one of or one of the uh most
recent massacres that uh was part of an
ongoing series of massacres that had
killed roughly onethird of the
population uh of East te war and and
you're written about that quite a bit um
and um people here actually uh it only
took a few hundred people there's only
you know four or 500 people on this room
um got together and figured out
strategically who to talk to who to
write to within Congress um to end uh
military aid to Indonesia um and that
was actually the very first step the
very first action by the United States
to um its Ally India say that we really
disapprove of what you're doing um in
killing in innocent um tear people um
and it was beginning of the end of the
occupation and killing in East teore um
right now unfortunately we're back um
yeah I will um uh uh right now we're
back at we're back um in a similar
situation um and that is that we're
about to um uh about to uh resume
military aid to um Indonesia and um I
was wondering what your thoughts about
that were and what we could do about
that at this point in history yeah
actually the
[Applause]
forming Ean the East teore Action
Network was quite an important action uh
the Indonesian invasion of East teore
began in
1975 with strong us support all the way
through also support of Britain France
and others Indonesia's a rich country
you know it's advantageous to be
friendly to them and as you said it
killed you know maybe the worst active
gen side in the late 20th century or one
of the worst all completely with us
support opposition actually began in 75
but it was minuscule I mean talk to two
people about it uh it did build up and
after the D Massacre the one you're
talking about when Alan narn and Amy
Goodman were attacked by Indonesian
forces it did get some publicity and
groups and etan was formed and that was
extremely important and remember that
was
1991 and the killing went on for another
8 years uh the Clinton Administration
strongly supported suaro he was our kind
of guy the in Clinton administration
said right through
1999 atrocities and massacres continued
was particularly striking because this
was the same year that there was a lot
of agonizing about the Serbian
atrocities in Kosovo which were nowhere
near as severe as what was going on in
east teamour of course the background
didn't even come close finally there was
a major massacre in August uh 1999 and
at that point International protest and
domestic protest which by then had built
up and et0 had a lot to do with this
International Pro protest against
Clinton was so strong that he took a
very simple step he told the Indonesian
Army it's
over literally
they had sworn they're never going to
depart this is our Province we're never
going to leave soon as they got you know
a word from the master saying game's
over they immediately
withdrew okay that tells you something
that tells you for the the for the
proceeding 25 years the United States
could have stopped it you know with a
flick of a
wrist uh you didn't have to bomb Jakarta
you know you didn't need sanctions
didn't need anything just stop
supporting it it's over it's kind of a
little like what happened with South
Africa and it could happen in this case
too just to follow up what cons students
do what can we do now well we got to
protest about it actually Alan narn
who's pretty much living in Indonesia
now and taking very dangerous steps
Allan is a fantastic person is now
challenging the Indonesian Army uh to
arrest him in Indonesia he's publicly
charging them with the atrocities that
he's exposed and it's a not a trivial
thing to do in
Indonesia not a nice place so he's
protesting it quite openly he's
insisting on being allowed to appear on
television to denounce them you know do
something about it and he's calling of
course for an end to military aid to the
to them and Ean is too so sure we can
join those efforts and support him he's
still facing serious Danger
uh thank you so much once again for
coming today Professor Chomsky and as a
member of brand students for justice in
Palestine we would really like to thank
you for your message of support but my
question uh relates towards the nuclear
weapons particularly American uh the
American facilitation of both the
expansion of uh weapons programs in
Israel Pakistan and India which all seem
to be rather schizophrenic given their
complicated histories not only among
India and Pakistan but particularly
among Pakistan and Israel and India's
vacillating relation relationship with
Israel so I was hoping you could comment
on that on the Israel India relationship
on just all three in the ways and the
second I guess equally schizophrenic
policy of the US supporting really just
um brutal regimes particularly the Saudi
and like Arab monarchs Who and the
Egyptian government who in no way
respect human rights and how that
facilitates American policy within the
Middle East and how that relates to isra
pretty straight I mean let's take Egypt
you know uh one of the worst dictator
ships in the region very harsh brutal
dictatorship uh you all read about
Obama's trip to Cairo how he was praised
you know for opening his heart to the
Muslim World everything's going to be
different you know we love you and so on
what didn't get much play maybe almost
nothing uh is uh a press conference
where he was asked on his way to Egypt
what are you going to say about Egypt's
as they put it authoritarian regime I
mean authoritarian is quite an
understatement but what are you going to
say about Egypt's authoritarian regime
well take a look at Obama's answer he
said uh I don't like to use labels for
folks when a politician pronounces the
word folks you just get ready for the
next series of Lies that's coming out uh
otherwise you talk about people but if
you refer of folks you know uh so the
next thing that came out is he's a good
man Mubarak uh he's uh running a stable
society and he's our friend so I'm not
going to criticize
anything okay uh what do you think
Egyptians or anybody in the Middle East
can how seriously can they take his
comments about human rights violations
in
Iran how seriously should we take them
and Saudi Arabia it's even worse you
know so what is this do for us I mean
these are loyal
clients uh the Middle East energy
reserves are you know one of the most
important issues in the world you go
back to the
1940s
highlevel us planners were talking about
uh how you know this is what they called
a stupendous source of strategic power I
mean one of the greatest material prizes
in world history if we can control that
region we can control the world and so
on and that hasn't changed that's why
the US has a a massive intervention in
the Middle East all the way through
replacing Britain which used to be in
the Forefront uh and yes so you support
dictatorial regimes I mean it's very
well understood you recall the George
Bush's plaintive question why do they
hate us and the answer you know they
hate our freedom and so on I mean the
Press was kind enough not to report or
commentators that the same question had
been asked by
Eisenhower in 1958 he raised the
question why is there a campaign of
hatred against us among the people of
the Middle East not the governments but
among the people and it was a little
surprising in 1958 because that was
right after uh the US had intervened to
kick uh Israel uh England and France out
of Egypt which they invaded But still
there was a campaign of hatred well the
National Security
Council released the highest planning
body released a study of it and said uh
it's true that
U they said there's a perception in the
Middle East that the United States
supports harsh and dictatorial regimes
and blocks democracy and development and
we do it because we want to gain control
over their resources and I went on to
say well you know perception is more
less accurate and that's what we should
do okay they don't hate us cuz they hate
our freedoms they hate us because they
want their freedoms and they understand
that the US supports
dictatorial oppressive
regimes blocks democracy and development
and we do it because that's the way we
control things and it's the same today
actually after
Bush's rather ignorant question the
defense science board one of the main
advisory panels of the Pentagon it came
out with a study you know why do they
hate us study and they said you know
it's not our freedoms it's our policies
they hate our policies uh for good
reasons as long as we so why do we
continue the policies when they we know
it's going to lead to hatred it's
because we're trusting the dictatorships
to hold down their
populations just as we're trusting Keith
Dayton's Army to keep uh U control of
the Palestinians so they'll be a
legitimate partner for Israel I mean
that's our policy not only there but all
all over the world and we didn't invent
it the British did the same you know the
French did the same and so on those are
imperial policies if we if we're in
favor of them okay let's be honest about
it at least and not pretend we're some
kind of a Messianic wilsonian state or
not the three countries with nuclear
weapons the three countries nuclear
weapons well even Pakistan developed
nuclear weapons during the Reagan years
and the Reagan administration pretended
it didn't know of course they knew uh
the reason is they were supporting zel
Huck who's the absolutely the worst and
most atrocious of the many military
dictators that uh Pakistan had uh zel hu
was also carrying out radical
islamization of Palestine of Pakistan
with Saudi support most of this the kind
of intellectual roots of Terror go right
back to Saudi Arabia uh and they were
giving plenty of money so they were
providing lots of funding for uh
developing uh you know madrasas actually
mean schools but special religious
schools where the children are train
just an extremist uh you know all they
do is read the Quran and you know learn
about extremist versions of uh Islam the
pudi versions and Reagan was supporting
that uh so we supported part of his
legacy is uh you know Al-Qaeda style
terrorism another part is Pakistani
nuclear weapons and the reason for it
was
uh you know there the Reagan
Administration was and also the
Democrats were very excited about
Afghanistan they were gathering up the
most extreme radical islamist Fanatics
they could find anywhere in the world uh
and sending him to Afghanistan and
arming him with Advanced weapons and so
on the goal was not to liberate
Afghanistan in fact the head of the CIA
station in Islamabad Pakistan who was
running the operation was very straight
about it he said we don't care one way
or another about AF Afghanistan the
point is to kill Russians and he said
that's a noble goal and that's what we
want to do when they got that goal they
left Pakistan in the hands of us back
Warlords who were so vicious that uh
when the Taliban came they were welcome
welcomed uh so that's Pakistan uh India
actually the us as long as India was
either neutralist or you know had pretty
good relations with the Russians the US
was opposed to their developing nuclear
weapons and imposed sanctions but by the
um last 10 years or so uh India has been
drifting towards a closer alliance with
Israel and the United States so and part
of that context is well they can have
nuclear weapons if they like and we'll
support it uh the treaty that granted
India the right to develop nuclear
weapons with our support has a somewhat
broader context for one thing it was
sold here straight out as for commercial
advantage that opens up India to arm
sales from the United States sales of
nuclear technology and so on you know
like a big market and growing country
but also it has to do with Iran I mean a
centerpiece of US policy is to isolate
Iran now India is energy short and the
obvious way for them to get energy is
with a pipeline from Iran and Iran
Pakistan India pipeline because Iran is
rich in energy but the US doesn't want
that it wants them not to get Iranian
energy uh part of the way to talk them
out of it was to give them support with
developing nuclear energy which meant
freeing up nuclear weapons development
and actually the invasion of Afghanistan
has to do with that too I mean in the
background of the invasion of
Afghanistan this goes back 20 years is
the idea of U setting up a pipeline from
Turkmenistan Central Asia which is very
rich in natural gas one of the biggest
in the world a pipeline from there to
India which would run through
Afghanistan in fact it would run through
kahar the place that's they're now
planning to attack and that pipeline if
it could be established would have two
functions for one thing it
would you undermine efforts to establish
Iran India relations and it would also
undermine Russia's efforts to maintain
control of its former uh you know parts
of what used to be the Soviet Union
that's a kind of a background
consideration for the invasion of
Afghanistan nobody knows just how signif
ific it is but in that context uh it's
understandable can't approve of it but
it's understandable why the US
government both Republicans and
Democrats would agree to uh support
India's violation of the
nonproliferation treaty and you know
develop nuclear weapons as far as Israel
is concerned that goes back to the
nexxon administration the nexxon
administration made a deal with Israel
that uh if you're interested in the
details this's a the main book about it
is by an Israeli analyst ofner Cohen
that's an English uh but what he reports
is that you know it's not on paper but
it's assumed that uh Nixon and prime
minister goldem Mayer just made a deal
that U the US would permit Israel to
maintain its policy of Silence you know
not admitting that it has nuclear
weapons and not denying it and that the
US would not interfere with that and
Obama reiterated that uh after the
international atomic energy agency
called on Israel to uh uh uh open up its
facilities so yeah it's a it's a client
State it's a valued us Ally so if they
want to have nuclear weapons
okay um you started addressing the
question but you've been talking
extensively about what international
laws we've violated and how we violated
them but maybe what what I would would
like you to elaborate a little bit on is
why we violated them and as a as a
followup to that is what concern to
local population SL international law we
should give in our quest to global
domination and um are access accessing
local uh local natural
resources look I'm suppose some
unbelievably powerful country you know
from Mars decided to take over us
Agricultural and mineral resources
because they wanted them I suppose they
were powerful enough to do
it what would we say they should
do we know what we would say they should
do okay same when we uh carry out what's
calling literally called protecting our
resources so you go back to top us
planners you know George Kennan and the
rest we say we have to use Force to
protect our resources which happen to be
in other countries but that's kind of
like an accident of History uh Clinton
for example His official Doctrine which
was worse than bushes was but it was
quiet so we made a fuss about it but the
official Doctrine was that the US uh
maintains the right to use Force to
ensure our control over markets and
resources elsewhere okay that's our
commitment should we do that should any
other country do that I mean should
should do we did we support Saddam
Hussein when he invaded
Kuwait why not I mean he was trying to
take control of their resources which uh
he actually had a claim on you know
there's an a serious Iraqi claim to uh
equate which was sort of stolen from
Iraq by the British to block Iraqi
access to the Sea when they established
but do do we say okay that's fine you
can protect your you can take your
resources by invading quit I mean we
have a principle about this and we apply
it to everyone except ourselves or our
clients okay that's should we do that
well you know it depends whether you
like to live in a criminal state in a
criminal Society uh as far as why we
violate international law the answer is
pretty straightforward because we can
get away with
it uh there's nobody else in the world
who's going to do anything about it and
as long as the American population is
passive and obedient no nobody will do
anything about it here I mean take say
the uh the world court case that I
mentioned to repeat the US is the only
country
now having lost the companionship of
Albania and Libya the only country that
uh has violated a world Court decision
take a careful look at that world Court
decision it's very
Illuminating the court Nicaragua brought
a case to the world Court run by a very
distinguished International lawyer
Harvard law professor uh the world Court
threw out most of the case almost the
entire case and just drew a decision on
very narrow grounds bilateral Nicaraguan
us treaty why' they throw out the case
because the world Court's rules require
that it cannot adjudicate a conflict
unless both parties agree to the
jurisdiction now when the US accepted
World Court jurisdiction in
1946 okay it added a
reservation saying that the US is immune
to any case that uh um relies on
international law meaning anything
involving the UN Charter or the charter
of the organization of American states
uh the US is immune to anything brought
up under those conditions meaning the US
this is 1946 when it was pretty much
running the world essentially said look
we do not accept jurisdiction we do not
accept the application of international
law to ourselves so the and the world
Court you know accepted that that's the
way its rules work and it even goes on I
mean in a couple of years ago I forget
early
2000s uh Yugoslavia brought a case to
the world Court about the NATO bombing
of Serbia okay uh one of the charges in
the
uh in the uh in indictment the petition
that they brought to the court was on
genocide well the US withdrew from the
court proceedings on the valid grounds
that when the US signed the genocide
convention after 40 years it added a
reservation saying it doesn't apply to
us okay so we're free to commit genocide
well okay we're free to commit genocide
we're free to violate the uh um the UN
Charter any other International treaty
because we say
so okay and we can say so first of all
practically nobody knows it you know you
have to be kind of like a specialist in
the topic to know it I mean if we cared
about our freedom you'd teach this kind
of thing in elementary school but almost
nobody knows it except a few Specialists
uh and it's uh if it's brought up it
would be considered perfectly legitimate
I mean take say the international
criminal court uh when the international
criminal court was was established a
couple of years ago uh it was not
permitted to include the crime of
aggression the most serious crime of all
uh because the US wouldn't tolerate that
we don't want the charges of aggression
to be floating around because we do too
much of it so that was knocked off uh
then even after that the US refused to
accept the jurisdiction of the court now
the public wants to I mean the public is
strongly in favor of accepting uh
International jurisdiction but Elites
are not so the US rejected the
jurisdiction of the international
criminal court and in fact a couple of
years ago Congress passed a law which
the president signed which in Europe is
sometimes called the Netherlands
Invasion act the law authorizes the
president of the United States to
invade
Holland uh if any American is brought to
the hag to the International Court to
rescue them I mean can anybody else even
say that you know you know okay if
you're a big enough bully and you have
an obedient population you can do what
you
like thank you very
much hi um I was I was thinking um you
talked earlier on that the USA and
America and is Isel work hand inand
together um committing war crimes and
breaking International laws and I know
that the US
USA gives over a billion dollar to
Israel annually and we as US
citizens we just paid we recently just
did our taxes and I couldn't help but
think wow some of my tax money is going
to go to Israel to help kill my family
and friends in Palestine and
then as Americans we go and try to enter
palestineisrael and we were given denied
entry and um our American citizenship
are stripped away from us and we give no
they give us
no um reason why like they give no
explanations denied entry and that's
about it who who are you referring to um
I guess a lot of my friends and families
who are not necessarily Palestinian
Americans but also
asian-americans just not allowed not
allowed entry you mean yeah are given
denied entry but are given no
explanations that's the least of it yeah
that's actually there's there are a few
Jews who are not allowed entry like uh
Richard Faulk the uh un rapporter for
Gaza or Norman finlin you know maybe
others Americans you know uh who happen
to be Jewish uh but sure that's bad but
you know that doesn't begin to compare
with the crimes that are being committed
in the occupied
territories uh and soly when you when
American citizens pay taxes not only are
they helping fund Israel but though they
don't know it they're funding an
organization with which is committed by
law in Israel to work for the benefit
only for the benefit of people I'm
quoting of of Jewish race religion and
origin and that organization is not a
small one it happens to control about
90% of the land in Israel and Americans
are contributing to that because that
organization has tax-free status it's
called the Jewish National
Fund I mean would you want to contribute
to an organization that uh is bound by
law to in say in the United States to uh
control 90% of the land for the benefit
of people of you know white religion
race and origin or something I mean
that's kept very quiet because if
Americans knew anything about this they
wouldn't like
it so okay that's the task of people who
care about the world let people know
w
[Applause]
