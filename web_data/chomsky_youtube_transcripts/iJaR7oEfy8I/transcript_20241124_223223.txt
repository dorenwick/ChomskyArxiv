I wonder if you could talk a little bit
about the findings that you discussed
from William Pope you talk about his
book violent politics and you also talk
about his essay falling into the Isis
trap
um quite some conclusions that he draws
that haven't been given the attention of
extremely interesting person he's fine
Middle East scholar general historian
very distinguished also he has a long
history at the top level of US
government planning on the National
Security Council is one of leading
figures for years in planning about the
Middle East and elsewhere he's the you
mentioned is actually a book about
insurgencies the beginning with the
American Revolution which it just
describes as an insurgency he points out
accurately that the u.s. dependence was
won by terrorists people we would know
there was independent militia was
carrying out terrorist acts George
Washington it tried to construct an
armed an elite style army on the British
model which was defeated all the
guerrilla forces with many terrorist
acts and of course France which
intervened their war of independence was
part of a global war between the major
powers of the day France France
intervened save the situation for the
insurgency many points out that there's
a pattern that runs through history
which is that foreign powers that
intervene set off a regular dynamic
maybe at first they were accepted but
their very presence causes actions which
lead to protest
which they then put down by force
setting off the dynamic of greater
purpose finally the war becomes a
political national war at which the
outside power always eventually loses
unless they destroy the society and this
is a pattern that runs all the way
through from his review the American
insurgency elsewhere that does discuss
the ISIS phenomenon other ways of
sensibly dealing with it what he points
out and here I should say it has I think
almost total agreement from every other
specialist who's paid attention serious
attention to the sources of the ISIS
jihadi phenomenon Isis in particular
Scott atrum is done he had his group
done extensive research on the topic
they all reach about the same conclusion
you know Isis is a total monstrosity
nobody questioned himself but there are
reasons for its existence if you hit it
again with a sledgehammer if that's your
reaction you'll create something worse
that's happened repeatedly every
Coburn's history of efforts to kill the
people you hate every time you kill one
of them the leader what happens is he's
replaced by somebody younger more
murderers and this happened over and
over it's recognized by the US
government
tarah specialists who warned against the
attempt to kill the leader of Isis
they say that something works as long as
you don't pay attention to the reasons
the sources and the background just
smashing it with your sledgehammer as a
way of making things worse that's been
shown over and over in recent history
it's anis and Iraq the civil war on
terror take a look at the war on
terrorism it was launched 2001 the types
of terrorist forces were located in a
small tribal area in a remote area in
Afghanistan al Qaeda was where are they
now all over the world every time you
smash them up the invasion of Iraq along
a sevenfold increase in terror the first
year and that just continues it's so
transparent right in front of us that
takes a genius not to see it the Pope
does give consider careful analysis any
points out that if you want to deal with
the ISIS monstrosity have to face facts
not illusions one fact is that it does
have reluctant but meaningful support
from the sending populations of the
region which regarded as at least some
defense against enemies that they fear
even more you have to face the fact that
the jihadi young jihadis who are
flocking to Isis from Western Europe
have reasons and the reasons are not
there
the Quran was very limited Islamic
background they may pick this up it's a
ideology that's not the source the
source is their lives they're living in
conditions of degradation repression
humiliation no options hated by the
environment in which they survive and
young people want something they want
some dignity they want some
opportunities and this offers them the
idea of maybe will construct an Islamic
utopia that draws them to it if you want
to undermine the sources of Isis
recruitment you have to face that fact
you have to ask what's happening in the
suburbs around Paris trying to survive
and Pope does discuss this Scott Avram
and others have also discussed it even
the Obama administration kind of back
handedly recognizes it that's the only
way to deal with the problem to deal
with the problem by just smashing it up
furthers just kind of spread the terror
and violence that's been happening
