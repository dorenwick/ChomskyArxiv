noam chomsky weighed in on Bernie
Sanders chances of success this is an
interesting video not sure we're all
gonna like his answer here but this is a
world-renowned intellectual and he's
being ruthlessly honest so let's listen
and then we'll discuss you have
expressed sense of support for Bernie
Sanders what what are some ways that
perhaps his outlook might fall short I
know you've called it couldn't have
described him as the New Deal Democrats
how are some way what are some ways that
he can change to to fit more to express
more the needs of the American people
well I think it's first of all kind of
academic the chances that Sanders will
win the nomination I think are not great
the main reason is these is tremendous
attack on them just take a look at how
he's treated in the media there's
actually it's pretty obvious just from
reading but there's a good study about
it by in these times and published a
detailed study the factual study of how
the media has been handling Sanders so I
think all stops will be old to make sure
that he doesn't get the nomination if he
gets the nomination the attacks will be
wild will get the whole Republican
propaganda machine going after this
Jewish atheist you know wants to kill a
little boy chances he could be elected a
pretty small but if he does get elected
miracle he won't have Congress how you
gonna win Congress the Congress is the
u.s. electoral system is structurally
constructed so that the reactionary
elements have an oval
well my advantage like in the last
election I think the Democrats won
Congress Senate by about twelve million
votes they lost the Senate that happens
all the time these is a structural
effect of that maximizes the effect of
the rural white conservative you know
where's our America and traditional the
Democratic votes tend to be concentrated
in the cities which most of them are
lost you know plus the gerrymandering on
the voter suppression everything else so
yes it has to be an enormous Democratic
victory for them to win Congress which
is unlikely furthermore even if you win
Congress most of the people elected from
the other month the Democrats are
basically what they call blue glow
Democrats moderate Republicans they're
not gonna support Sanders as plans on
top of all of that there's a very the
fact is that US politics are dominated
by wealth and we see that all the time
the wealthy basically control
legislation so the barriers against
carrying out progressive legislation or
quite so could happen mobilization the
kind that took place in the 1930s that
enabled that might sound like a
depressing answer but he gave you a
little ray of hope at the end there so
let's go through this um
he's basically saying like okay be a
realist it's unlikely that this is gonna
go the way that the left wants it to go
however there's that little caveat at
the end that little asterisks at the end
where he said well you would need a mass
mobilization the likes of which we saw
in the 1930s for the New Deal yeah and
I'd add to that you need a mass
mobilization the likes of which we saw
with the civil rights movement
so this is this it's not like this is
historically unprecedented there is a
precedent and it's actually been quite a
while until we since we've seen this
kind of mass mobilization so one could
argue we're overdue for that mass
mobilization but it seems like even
though he's overall pessimistic he does
concede well if you have that mass
mobilization well then it is certainly
possible that we get positive outcomes
so that's where I say to him I totally
agree with you on that know where I
disagree with him is I think that he's a
little too pessimistic on Bernie's
chances I get where he's coming from
because we've all been burned so many
times but there's reason to have at
least some hope because look at what
happened with Trump in the Republican
primary and Noam Chomsky's pointed this
out himself where the Republican
establishment basically wanted anybody
but Trump at first they threw their
weight behind Jeb Bush Jeb Bush
immediately imploded then they said okay
not Jeb Bush Marco Rubio they threw
their weight behind Marco Rubio he
imploded then at a desperation there
like Kasich Kasich never really had too
much of a moment in the Sun he came in
like second in a couple primaries but he
obviously didn't hold up then the
Republican establishment even said fine
we'll take Cruz and they started back in
Cruz and that didn't work so Donald
Trump trumped the Republican
establishment all of the cars were
against him the deck was stacked against
him and he won that Republican primary
and then he won the White House the fact
that that could happen on the Republican
side means it could definitely happen on
the Democratic side because I Got News
for you they're just as disorganized on
the right and the left when it comes to
the establishment they're overconfident
they're arrogant they're cocky what they
really have is the money that's what
they really have but if there's ever
been a time in US history
post the corruption entering the system
in the 1970s that we could potentially
over
the money issue it's now AOC one with a
ten to one disadvantage in money a lot
of Justice Democrats won with that
disadvantage there was ever time that we
could do it we could do it now so what
he's not giving enough credit to is the
notion of Bernie trumping the primary if
you will where you could win so
overwhelmingly that they don't even know
what hit him and that's what we're
trying to bring to fruition that's what
we're fighting for that's why
everybody's so involved I'm a monthly
donor to Bernie Sanders and I'm happy to
be a monthly donor to Bernie Sanders I
know a lot of you guys are helping the
campaign out knocking on doors making
phone calls donating yourselves you know
spreading the word as much as possible
people are serious about this now will
it work yet to be seen I don't know um
but we're gonna do everything we can in
the meantime now the other point is even
if Bernie loses he's already won now you
could say well I mean that's a little
too airy-fairy a point fair enough if
you don't like that point then put it
aside but me and my eyes when I look at
the political landscape today guys
he's already shifted the Overton Window
massively to the point where if you
don't support Medicare for all as a
Democrat it's scandalous and people are
mad at you that's a win that's a giant
win he shifted the Overton Window how
many young new Bernie Sanders is he
spawning how many people are now going
to run for office and they have an
ideology similar to Bernie Sanders and
they're also uncorrupted because they've
developed moral beliefs before they've
gotten involved in the political scene
he's spawning a lot of Bernie Sanders
and you might not see them now well you
actually you are starting to see them
now but imagine what its gonna be like
in ten years it's just getting more and
more more and more and more so that in
and of itself is a victory and then the
final point is he references how well
the media is gonna treat him terribly
and they've been treating him terribly
so it's gonna it's so hard from to
overcome that here's what Chomsky misses
on that front that could be a benefit in
many ways what's my evidence again Trump
there was non-stop media coverage of
and it was overwhelmingly negative but
it helped him why did it help him
because the anti-trump stories that the
media ran with were generally really
silly anti-trump stories the one that
always sticks out in my mind was the
when he did a rally saying TPP is gonna
rape us and for at least a full day
maybe more multiple news cycles they did
outrage coverage over the fact that he
used the word rape they literally
invited on like victims and we're like
please explain why this is so offensive
and I think people's reactions that
people the media constantly
underestimates the intelligence of
people and people know when they're
being spoon-fed [ __ ] and people knew
when they watched that like he didn't he
wasn't it's a phrase he was using
it's like he's obviously it's obviously
not as outrageous as you guys are making
it out what he's really saying is the
trade deals are bad that's what he's
saying and we get that and so when you
do negative coverage non-stop but the
angles you're using to attack the
opponent are bad you help that person
you just signal boost them that's all
you're doing
they did it with Trump and then now with
Bernie they're doing it arguably even
worse because every time they attack
Bernie it's something ridiculous way
more ridiculous than the attacks on
Trump were so the more they attack him
it could help Bernie because people know
oh well I don't like the media the media
has a lower approval rating than any of
these politicians do they're
historically low so since that's the
case does they could attack him but he's
way more popular they're helping him if
they do that as long as the arguments
suck they're helping him the only issue
is if they start being indifferent and
there's signs of that as well
so I would agree with Noam if the media
just acts like Bernie doesn't exist that
could hurt Bernie that could hurt him
and some of them are doing that but I
feel like the majority of the stuff is
coverage and negative coverage which
helps him more than it hurts him so I
think he kind of is not understanding a
dynamic that definitely exists in
today's political scene which is nobody
likes the media everybody sees through
them now so if they attack your opponent
if they attack your candidate
it helps your candidate in this similar
way to how when Hillary attacked Tulsi
Tulsi went up in the polls because
people don't like Hillary
so whoever she's attacking they're like
I guess you can't be that bad so that's
a dynamic he's missing for
understandable reasons because in the
past maybe it did work in the way he's
describing or if the media tries to take
you down they actually take you down but
this is not me saying
Bernie's definitely gonna win cuz I
don't know what's gonna happen but what
I'm saying is don't be nihilistic about
it don't be pessimistic about it just
fight as hard as you can and run through
the tape because even Chomsky admitted
there at the end well yeah but if
there's a mass mobilization like in the
1930s for the New Deal stuff and as I'm
saying like a mass mobilization like the
civil rights movement as long as we get
out in those streets things could go our
way because the reality is even if
Bernie's elected he's gonna face
tremendous opposition not just from the
Republicans but from half the Democratic
Party at least so that means even if
Bernie's elected we hit the streets and
we hit the streets and we demand
Medicare for all free college living
wage ending the wars we demand the
legalization of marijuana and freeing
every single nonviolent drug offender we
demand all that stuff and more and we
shift that Overton Window further and
maybe we only went on 16% of the things
we're fighting for but that is a
gigantic victory because you helped
millions of lives in the process
so Noam Chomsky's brilliant but don't
let his commentary here get you to doubt
the answer is the same whether we're
doing well we're doing poorly keep
working fight harder and whatever
happens happens
