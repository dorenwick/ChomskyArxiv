years ago my one of my daughters was
working with the United Farm Workers for
a couple of years out in California and
she described to me a project that was J
then underway at the uh at I think at
Davis California the University where
they were trying to
create uh cubicle tomatoes because
they'd be easier to
store you can imagine what they would
taste like but that's pretty much what
goes on so like say take Tomatoes I mean
I actually did read an interesting book
about I forgot the name of the author
about the production of tomatoes in the
United States and uh it's industrialized
I mean they're apparently they produce
the kinds of tomatoes that'll last on
the supermarket shelf and that look red
or maybe they even color them I don't
know but they look like tomatoes but
they taste like sawdust and uh I I
imagine they have no nutritional value
but that makes sense from the point of
view of commercialized agriculture after
all you're in it to make money not to
feed people and it drives U productive
agriculture out it drives Farmers out
and has a horrible effect elsewhere in
the world I mean we talk about an
supposedly an immigration problem in the
United States a lot of the so-called
problem is due to the fact that the
trade agreement with Mexico was designed
to destroy Mexican
agriculture Mexican compos are perfectly
efficient but they can't possibly
compete with the highly subsidized us
Agro business there is a movement for
better use of
the uh farms and ranches and
forests uh it's a very encouraging
movement it has it's a competent
movement and it has a lot to
show uh it is not at this point a
massive Movement we wrote up the 50-year
farm bill spent quite a bit of time
thinking that through and um
uh in a way we knew when we took it to
Washington Fred kersman Wendel Barry and
I took it to Washington we knew the
likelihood of it getting adopted was
pretty close to zero but what it has
done is increased the
imagination about
possibilities uh in a lot of different
places now what we're can hope for is
that that begins to get some
grip uh on a large and the development
of a constituency agriculture is the
largest product of humanity and
currently uh it occupies
area of 1/3 of land mass of the Earth
which is larger than the area of Asia
agriculture in my view uh is the first
environmental uh problem the oldest and
it started with the need to tear up the
ground in order to have a seed bed for
an
annual and there's where the idea that
nature is to be subdued or ignored
we're going to be in a period probably a
long period of food insecurity because
we've we've it was always a good bet for
10,000 years you know that if your
grandfather grew corn in a field your
his granddaughter would be able to do
the same and that's just a sucker's bet
now I mean you know um it's gotten it's
getting routinely too hot to grow crops
in a lot of places and when it isn't or
too dry we also see these big increase
in very extreme downpour in Del and
that's no good for farming either so you
know it's it's going to be a magic act
to try and keep enough food on the table
for the population as large as ours one
of the one of the most U uh serious sort
of manifestations of food shortage
is something we're now seeing in a
number of countries which is foodless
days um something like 20 24% of the
people in Nigeria now routinely plan
foodless days families cannot eat every
day same is true in Ethiopia in the
India uh Peru um so we've we we're now
seeing evidence further evidence of how
Food Supplies are tightening and at some
point this begins to translate into
Political instability let's say we feed
7 billion and then we feed nine billion
and then we feed 12 billion and all the
time we are doing that we are
compromising the soils uh we are
contributing to more greenhouse gases we
better start asking the question so we
feed them then what
then what what about what doubling are
we going to quit uh paying attention to
so what we're doing in the interest of
the Here and Now is compromising the
long-term potential there's an oce and
economics of externalities you know
things you don't pay attention to when
you're carrying out a transaction and
that's what you're describing so yes
let's nice to feed more people but what
else are we doing what well you know
what they were doing they're poisoning
the environment destroying the soil
making it harder produce creating pests
for which you have to create new
pesticides and an ongoing struggle
against nature to try to maintain the
thing so it's a very mixed story what
could actually what's the what could
what could the value of resources be
ultimately even from a human perspective
if it gets really really tight go to
Haiti now and see what how much are
people needing to give up in order to
get food you know so so desperate people
after 40 Years of
work on this topic I have
concluded that it is outside the
capacity of this culture to deal with
these issues so Solutions are going to
be imposed on
us so I'm all in favor re EO uh
technology mushrooms and trees are
terrific and solar energy is great uh
but if you somehow imagine you could
plug it into the current Global
political system and it's going to solve
problems and of course just a
fantasy our agriculture cannot exist for
thousands of years by
definition and so so we do have a
problem you know we probably went
already through half of soil in Midwest
or so top soil so and that's 150 years
and if you want to look how agriculture
looks like you know 4,000 years down the
road in countries that didn't do it
quite well look at the Middle East
Middle East essentially is a history of
failed
agriculture that's what it is and all
these conflicts and and terrible
displacement that you have there is in
fact related to soil that went dead and
and an inability to feed people one of
the
keys to a more sustainable approach to
agriculture is a less Capital intensive
one where farmers aren't so
worried
about paying these enormous bills those
tractors that cost hundreds of thousands
of
dollars uh the the incredible price of
land which comes up because farmers are
competing with each other right why is
that land so expensive well it's it's
expensive in part because farmers are
producing at such a close margin when
you've got
a high volume low margin situation the
only solution is for you to produce more
in a in a certain sense there's nothing
that Fails Like
success you tend not to learn from it
you know you uh you know we're getting
160 or 70 bushel acre corn uh we got
these big soy brain crops I mean we know
what we're doing we say
because we live with this illusion of
the speed at which it's going water
shortages are
becoming uh more acute and and we see
them almost everywhere now that we have
agriculture um so we have climate we
have water we have population growth
continuing to um continuing to be a
problem we're still adding 80 million
people a year that means there'll be
219,000 people at the dinner table
tonight who weren't there last night
tonight there'll be another
219,000 and that that's sort of
Relentless we keep keep it keeps
pressing and keeps putting more and more
pressure on the Earth's resources
agriculture is a huge user of water in
fact it's the second largest user of
water after power generation um
electrical power stations but Power
stations Mo mostly cycle water through
make it warmer and you can actually
reuse that water while with agriculture
you know it gets U incorporated into the
plants and evaporated so you need
deliver water and then of course the
water that you deliver if it has salts
the salts accumulate in soil so you have
to flush the soil and then you have the
problem of too much salt building in
parts of your system which is what you
see when you drive down the Central
Valley in California where big swap are
completely dead used for storage of
salts from the soil in fact toxic salts
because there's all kinds of metallic
stuff that is being washed with this
water you know cadmium Mercury all kinds
of other things we're already in a
process of drastic change and
discontinuity so it's not as if we could
look out 40 or 50 years and see that we
need to do something by then I've said
often and it continues to be borne out
just by the front pages of the
papers we and by we I mean Humanity most
especially the industrialized uh part of
it are in a period now where over the
next 20 years we will see more drastic
changes than we saw in the last
100 changes in the political system in
the living
standards uh in the uh quality of
environment
and so forth there's no Global problem
really there's a global storm and the
question is how ready is your boat and
with boat that don't mean I mean could
be a nation it could be your investment
it could be your city because cities
don't
move so it seems so obvious and that's
kind of missed in the in the public
policy debate and that goes in back to
agriculture that we think oh we can I
mean like the economic Economist extreme
statement nor House made this statement
some years ago 20 years ago I think when
he said oh agriculture is just 2% of the
GDP
we grow for year and that's like we we
got these 2%
back and then more physically oriented
economists say yeah but if you take out
2% of your body like your heart you
cannot grow it back that easily my
son-in-law who's in
Mexico just wrote me a couple days ago
about an area in northern Mexico which
is just being where the and he sent me
an newspaper article about where the
trees everything's just being cut down
and destroyed and what where there are
trees they being sold for
firewood uh was an apple orchard but
it's again impossible to compete with
highly subsidized us Agro business and
in Haiti it was scandalous I mean the uh
when Clinton sent the Marines in finally
to restore the president he did it with
a condition that they set up uh
uh harsh neoliberal rules which bar any
kind of
tariffs uh and uh Arkansas rice Farmers
again heavily subsidized you know big
business can produce rice at at a cost
that'll undercut very productive Haitian
Farmers a that effect Haiti became
dependent on foreign rice and the U rice
farming disappeared here actually same
thing happened with chickens one of
Haiti's very
few successful small Industries was
producing chicken
parts but Americans apparently don't
like dark meat so the big producers like
Tyson have a extra dark meat on their
hands and they'd like to sell it dump it
basically so they tried dumping it in
Mexico and Canada but those are
governments that function so they
blocked it by anti- dumping procedures
but thanks to Clinton Haiti couldn't do
it so Tyson managed to wipe out Tyson
and others to wipe out Haitian chicken P
manufacturing this kind of thing goes on
all over the place and it's uh it's
destructive of Health it's destructive
of independent Farmers uh there is a
international movement via compa which
is trying hard to uh resist it I've
actually been at inter National conferen
of theirs which are this one was in
Brazil which uh which brings together it
was quite exciting actually brought
together peasants from all over the
world you know mostly pretty poor people
but um they were there were stalls were
women were showing off seeds that they'd
cultivated and telling others about them
a lot of interchange a lot of excitement
enthusiasm and that represents some
counter tendency of which what people
like like you were doing as a part so
there there is a tendency towards
commercialization and uh uh aiming at
money not not successful not not
anything useful nothing useful for
people may be harmful but money and
there's an alternative tendency towards
trying to you know something that's
called localism towards trying to grow
food locally cut back on the exorbitant
Transportation costs and improve the
health success and of course that's you
know it's kind of an unequal battle on
the one hand you have highly
concentrated Capital supporting by state
supported by state power as in the
examples I mentioned on the other hand
you have uh people trying to do things
on their own that's a that's not just
agriculture that's over the whole
society I mean the whole society is
being driven by in especially the last
generation or so by an an ideology of of
uh um actually there was a name for it
back in the mid 19th century in the
early days of the Industrial Revolution
right around here in
Massachusetts working people who were
forced into
the U
factories women young women from the
Farms Factory girls they were called you
know Irish Artisan from Boston and so on
they a very Lively labor press that they
were at themselves and they bitterly
condemned the industrial system which
was degrading them was taking away their
freedom their creativity their
individuality their culture and one
thing that they condemned was what they
called the new spirit of the age gain
wealth forgetting all but
self for 150 years a huge propaganda
system has been trying to drive that
into people's heads you're happy if you
can consume more forget about everyone
else and make sure you're okay and it's
created U a kind of a sociopathic
Society the agriculture industry
produces large quantities of greenhouse
gas emissions because the agriculture
industry the corporate agriculture
industry is essentially an extension of
the fossil fuel industry you know
synthetic fertilizer fuel for traction
and then the energy to move the
resulting commodity food thousands of
miles around the world these are these
add up um that's that's why it's very
good news uh that we're starting to see
the
reaction that local food is the fastest
growing part of our food economy that uh
uh that last year for the first time in
150 years the USDA said that there were
more farms in America not fewer that's a
very good sign now whether we can keep
it going uh it's it's it's hard because
every time Congress passes a farm bill
they help the
biggest corporate Growers and hinder the
smallest Community Farmers but people's
desire for real food and good food at
the moment is kind of trumping that and
that's magnificent to see after having
gotten into farming myself 20 years ago
now I've realized that guess what it is
it is about aggro business in that the
smaller Family Farms if we want to
survive we have to band together and uh
collaborate with one another we can use
whatever model and form we want whether
it's llc's llps C corporations
cooperatives whatever works for the
people involved but we have to stick
together and continue to you know raise
our Livestock in a Humane manner uh to
grow our crops without herbicides and
pesticides if we so choose because if we
don't hang together surely we'll hang
separately slow food well I think as
long as we have a lot of Highly dense
energy we're going to have fast food
uh slow slow money as long as we have
highly dense energy we're going to have
fast money uh but that doesn't mean that
slow food and Slow Money uh are
irrelevant it simply means that they are
kind of
placeholders uh the examples that are
going to be around uh that serve as the
um uh the PO the places of potential to
expand as our Consciousness gets better
and the perceived need becomes greater
when when when you think about
agriculture we have to think about an
Enterprise that changes the entire
planet and it has emissions uh pollution
potential which is larger than uh any
other human activity and and I hate to
add you including fossil fuels and that
sounds counterintuitive
but you have to understand that
agriculture started about 8,000 years
ago uh essentially from burning forest
and and you know massive deforestation
which has been occurring ever since and
even if your emissions per year of let's
say CO2 are small but you continue doing
this for 8,000 years your cumulative
emissions are huge just look at the
front page of any newspaper and when you
start reading about climate change and
droughts and
U uh food uh import requirements for
many people and so forth and so on it's
it's clear that we're in overshoot
overshoot in the simplest way is if we
take from if for any species but if we
take from that ecosystem given ecosystem
more than what it can regenerate within
a given time let's say over a year
period so we can cut trees more quickly
than they regenerate we can pump water
more quickly out of the aqua that they
regener that recharges can fish more
rapidly
Etc I don't do this
work because I'm an optimist and I don't
really even think I am an optimist
particularly I think anybody who does
this stuff alternates between all
between optimism and pessimism hundreds
of times on a daily basis
and I kind of think it's almost like
that fluctuating between the two is like
alternating current and that's kind of
the energy that drives me forward really
I think if you were just an optimist all
the time it would be fairly ridiculous
really you know but Paul Hain has that
thing where he says if you're if you're
not if you're a pessimist if if you're
an
optimist uh if if if if if you if you
read the climate science and you're and
you're not a pessimist you haven't read
it properly go back and read it again
and if you've and if you've been come
into contact with the movement of people
around the world who are trying to do
something about it and you're an
optimist you don't have a heart which I
kind of go along with that you know
there is no guarantee that this is going
to
work I I don't know if it's going to
work who can you know there's no this
work doesn't come with any promises or
guarantees or anything and you know if
you spend time reading you know the
stuff about what's happening with the
oceans and the acidification of the
oceans and stuff is just absolutely
absolutely
ghastly um
but at the same time you know as I
say I meet I meet movements and people
and organizations who who who've given
up and I don't see that this is the time
to give up this is absolutely not a time
to give up yes the organic content of
our soils has dropped a lot people
around the world are discovering and
it's very good news that the agronomist
bring us that crop yields are at their
highest on small farms often with very
low inputs of things uh you know we
replaced a lot of human labor and human
skill and judgment with fossil fuel over
the last 50 years and bringing back some
of that skill and judgment and some of
that muscle work too um uh will result
in higher yields on smaller farms and
that's good news for everybody except
Carill and ADM uh the what what's going
on with with toxins on this planet is
just mind-blowing to me that that we
would who ever thought this was a good
idea let's put poison on our food
brilliant an evil genius couldn't have
come up with a better plan for us even
soil is just dirt we poison it with
pesticides and herbicides we plant um
these uh genetically modified plants
that exud toxins and in fact kill
bacteria around them and around their
root Roots they prevent them from uh
let's say soybeans from sequestering
nitrogen which was which soybeans do so
well otherwise and so we're doing things
with which are in exactly opposite
direction to what we should be doing
genetic engineering gene splicing as
it's currently done the knowledge of
what uh genes and what which traits are
critical for increases in productivity I
think that research is very important
well then when it comes to finding new
genetic variants
variations
uh saving Oodles of seed is where it's
at you cannot find a more coste
effective uh way of finding new genetic
variations than by letting pollination
take place what is interesting is of all
the different promises that the biotech
gene splicing world has come up with the
only things that they've done are simple
one or two Gene splices that only confer
like resistance to an herbicide what
they have not done yet is um uh a non um
come up with a series of traits that
produce a non um trade out that don't
have negative consequences they haven't
come up with a massive breakthrough that
increases productivity the the yield
potential of corn and soybeans has not
gone up since biotech you just have
different tools tools at your at your
disposal now different chemicals that
you can use from my perspective it's new
dependencies that now you become
dependent on your on your supplier for
your new inputs but it has not produced
any uh increase in the yield potential
of crops the big issue with GMO
seeds is that they haven't been
developed with an eye towards solving
problems they've been developed with an
eye for making more money and the two
are not the same at
all I think that also means that some of
the ways that GMO development has been
done has been using techniques which
Rush something to the
market before we've been able to check
and study if it was going to be
ecologically appropriate if it was going
to be okay for People's Health so again
it's that money basis uh
behind it we're genetically selecting
for the plants that can handle the world
as it actually is the Macintosh Apple
was first discovered I think it was
1839 it has not changed in 175 years
well the world has and we haven't
changed our varieties fast enough we
need to produce new varieties plant a
zillion seeds select the ones that
reproduce real quick the first ones that
set seed we want those ones that are
pest free disease free and can subsist
and persist and thrive on whatever soils
we have uh somewhat of a heresy is the
fact that I claim that there's no such
thing as a soil deficiency mineral
deficiency anywhere on this planet
people like what of course there is you
know the whole uh you know fertilizer
industry is based on that plants will
live everywhere on planet Earth uh there
will PL are plants that will live on
Solid Rock plants will live with every
single mineral deficiency know known to
mankind but only the plants that are
adapted and selected for those
conditions so everywhere around the
globe we can select for those plants
simply by putting those seeds in the
ground and using the selection criteria
that I just mentioned before one of my
big fantasies is the inaugural address
of a president that would go something
like
this my fellow Americans from this day
forward we as a people will measure our
progress by how independent of the
extractive economy we become we're not
going to stop anything all at once but
we're going to start a
tendency and tomorrow morning my first
executive order will be to put a cap on
the mines the well heads and the Port of
Entry and on
deforestation and next year we'll lower
that cap some more and then we'll see
how good our technology can
be my fellow Americans our technology
potential has not been really tested
because it has all come during expansion
in the consumption of fossil
fuels now a lot of people can
imagine uh them given that inaugural
address but why is it that the
politician cannot if if the people who
currently manage the economy won't
create the economy that we want to see
we need to create it ourselves and we
need to get on with it now and that's
what we're seeing in transition all over
the place whether it's transition or not
you know there's all kinds of stuff
really doesn't matter what it's called
but you know people starting to put in
place new Food Systems new Energy
Systems it seems to me like actually
we're on the verge of being able to
bring in uh investment to drive that we
bring in the right support to enable
that we bring in some kind of profile
and and and and stuff for that I don't
see any reason why we can't scale this
up really really quickly
