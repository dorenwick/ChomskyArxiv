here's a question will U.S society and
its economy be uh
reformed without direct action militants
and revolution
well you know talk about I want you to
think through these things carefully
let's think about a revolution
I mean if a revolution is going to be at
all constructive not not just establish
some horrible dictatorship worse than
you happened there's only one way it can
come about
that's if a large mass of the population
in fact the larger majority come to
recognize that changes that they want
cannot be instituted within the
framework of existing institutions
that means that if you're a real
dedicated revolutionary you're a
reformist
there's no conflict between reform and
Revolution what you want to do is press
the institutions as far as possible
to yield to just popular demands and if
the population comes to recognize look
it can't be done anymore
okay then you can talk about a
revolution but not before
and if you look at people who are really
interested in revolutions like Karl Marx
they they press this all the time in
fact he even believed that in the uh in
England you know country that entered
the most the freest country of his day
parliamentary system in England the
United States might be possible to
establish a Communist Revolution without
any violence at all
just by pressing forward within the
framework of the institutions that they
have well maybe so maybe not but that's
the Criterion
so I think
just again endure sweat
Juan and Amy said you have to try in
every possible way to
bring the
the changes bring about the changes that
we think ought to be made by means that
are available and going back to occupy I
agree with Amy it was a tremendous
achievement but there's a gap
the 99 percent have to participate
uh and that hasn't been achieved and
that's pretty important it's good it's
good to bring it to public attention put
it on the national agenda get people to
think about it but that's only the first
step the next step is to engage the 99
and that's
a hard task just as it has been with
every popular movement and you have to
remember if you look at the history of
popular movements they have had
successes I mean it was a much Freer
Jester country than it was not that long
ago but it's always partial successes
actually the Civil Rights Movement which
was mentioned a couple of times is a
very interesting example and should be
thought about when you listen to the
speeches on Martin Luther King Day or
you know you read the glowing reports of
the Civil Rights Movement they almost
invariably end in 1963 with his great I
Have a Dream speech Martin Luther King
didn't stop at that point he went right
on actually he moved to the north to try
to organize
programs first in Chicago about the
horrible housing situation and not just
for blacks although there's a race class
correlations largely but and that was
just beaten back he kept trying to
organize a a movement of the poor in
fact when he was in Memphis as somebody
I think Amy said he was assassinated
while
taking part in a sanitation worker
strike public workers strike
he also gave and I Have a Dream speech
then very powerful one but try to find
it it was the evening he was
assassinated he used his normal biblical
rhetoric you know he said he felt like
Moses standing on a mountain he could
see the promised land of land of freedom
and Justice he was not going to get
there he knew that but you can get there
if you struggle on
then he was assassinated
the mark he was planning a March on
Washington
Poor People's march to set up a Poor
People's movement the March took place
right away it was led by his widow
Coretta king started from the motel
where he was assassinated in Memphis it
went through the major places of big
civil rights struggles in the South you
know Selma Birmingham and so on it got
to Washington and they set up an Occupy
Movement they set up a tent camp in
Washington
to try to bring to Congress The Plea to
do something for the poor
which is the the suppressed the poor
working people and so on Congress which
is the most liberal Congress in American
history let them stay there for a while
and then sent the police in in the
middle of the night smashed up the camp
Resurrection City and drove him out of
town
well that part of the Civil Rights
Movement wouldn't be objective to talk
about it it's the wrong story what
actually happened is that Northern
liberals were okay pretty happy about
denouncing racist sheriffs in Alabama
you know it makes us feel good but not
us please if you look at what happened
in the North the racism
was deep remains deep efforts to break
into it have been beaten down at every
Point whether it's bussing desegregation
almost anything you can think of not for
us you can
you can vote in the South if you like
and what's happened to the country is
pretty shocking I'm sure you've all
looked at the maps after the election
you know they blew in red Maps the first
thing that this brings to mind is this
is the Civil War
it's almost identical to the Civil War
the Confederacy in the north the only
difference is the names have inverted
uh the What's called the red States now
used to be the Democrats blue States
used to be the Republicans now it's
switched and what happened is in the
night and there's a reason for that in
the 1960s the civil rights legislation
uh infuriated
Northern liberals didn't want to hear
about it now it's okay down there but
not us and Richard Nixon came along and
recognized that he couldn't
build up the Republican party but what's
called the southern strategy just take
the racist South and call it Republican
and inverted and a lot of things happen
that people should think about like take
blessing the busing was one of the
programs that turned the white working
class
against that drove the white working
class into the ultra-reactionary parties
and you can see why
so you take a look at the way busing was
set up
the programs were organized by you know
liberal
judges Democratic judges
but typically they'll take Boston where
I am uh you know a liberal judge Harvard
trustee he said we got to set up a
busing program which forces Irish kids
into the black areas and black kids into
the Irish areas but not into the suburbs
not into the affluent white suburbs we
were out of it well you know take a
Irish
yeah telephone worker or something
worked all his life he was finally able
to get enough money to buy a small home
and the Irish section of the city where
there's people I came around and these
kids go to the high school you can cheer
for the foot cheer for the football team
you know he's got a life all of a sudden
some liberal judge out in the suburbs
tells him your kids are going to have to
go into the black ghetto and black kids
are going to have to come here how do
you think it reacts he becomes a racist
he starts voting for Nixon and Reagan
Romney totally undercutting his own
interests but northern liberals have a
lot to answer for about this and in fact
this goes way back to the Civil War if
you look at American political history
after the Civil War there were about 10
years of
relative freedom for blacks
African-Americans then there was a
compact
it was a reconstruction period Then
There was a north-south compact which
the north basically said do whatever you
like
and what they did was criminalize black
life
literally which reimposed the form of
slavery in many ways worse than the
original a slave owner had to at least
care for his property
but when you throw people in prison and
the state provides them to U.S cheap
labor chain gangs Minds you know
industrial plants it's fantastic you
don't have to do anything the state
takes care of them so it's a form of
slavery which actually lasted until the
second world war when labor was needed
free labor was needed and it's never and
it affected the political system you
look at the political parties that
formed after reconstruction they were
sectional parties
the slogan was you vote where you shoot
if you were in the Confederacy
you vote Democratic if you're in the
north you vote Republican it was some
mixture because Catholic Workers in the
north were Democrats they were in
Tammany Iran you know establishments but
it's basically the story in one way or
another it goes still today
one reason we've never had class-based
political parties
they're sectional they're based on
they're racist and other criteria which
are not very pretty and you get what you
saw Wednesday morning in the maps on the
newspapers these are pretty deep
problems and uh you know a lot of the
people we
are the circles we're part of you know
are implicated in this
wasn't just racist Southerners
thank you I'm afraid we're close to the
end of our time and this question
intrigues me so I'm going to end with
this one terrorist primary primary
weapon is fear
fear is used as a reason to increase
military spending and to violate civil
liberties however terrorism can never be
completely eliminated how can this
Catch-22 situation be changed
well I think we can take long steps to
eliminating Terror one very simple step
is to stop participating in it and that
I mean that would
the
and I'm not joking I mean people now
talk about the war on terror is being
declared by George W bush in 2001 that's
totally false it was declared by Ronald
Reagan as soon as he got into office the
core of American foreign policy he said
was going to be a struggle against
State directed International terrorism
and then comes all the fancy rhetoric
plague of the Modern Age he returned to
barbarism and so on and then came 10
years of massive Terror by the U.S
how that's why it's never talked about I
mean hundreds of thousands of people
were killed in Central America uh well
over a million in South Africa where the
United States supported the Reagan
particularly supported the apartheid
regime as part of the war on terror
he even had to override Congressional
sanctions by the late 80s to keep
supporting them and the reason was
explicit the African National Congress
is I'm quoting one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world
that's Mandela's African National
congresses you probably know Mandela
himself only got off the terrorist list
a couple years ago he had to have
special dispensation to come to the
United States Middle East tens of
thousands of people killed and who were
in in the terrorist War I mean the worst
terrorist atrocities there were
literally run by the United States so
for example the worst the peak of
interest in the media in international
terrorism was 1985. that's when media
editors picked terrorism in the Middle
East as the leading story of the year
that it was fair the worst terrorist act
in the Middle East was in Lebanon a
truck bombing which killed 85 roughly 80
people women and girls when they were
leaving a mosque the truck bombing was
set up to go a big truck bomb to go off
when people are leaving the mosque
hundreds injured but that's not part of
the doesn't enter the the story of
terrorism for a very simple reason it
was organized by the CIA
they were trying to kill a cleric
quietest cleric
and they missed they just killed yeah 80
other people a big fuss a couple weeks
about it go about a bombing in Lebanon
which killed some people and yeah it's
terrorist act didn't come close to this
the next major terrorist act in that
year was the Israeli bombing of Tunis
oh on no pretext just you can kill them
they killed about 70 people you know
smart bombs the whole business the U.S
participated by not informing its
Tunisian Ally that the bombers were on
their way U.S sixth Fleet pulled back in
fact they have to fly over the
Mediterranean refuel of course the U.S
knew it and informed them the third
major terrorist Act was
of what the Shimon Paris the great Dove
he was prime minister called The Iron
Fist operations in occupied Southern
Lebanon was illegally occupied in
violation of Security Council orders and
there was resistance so Israel carried
out major terrorist operations against
what they call terrorist villagers
in southern Lebanon that was the third
major terrorist act none of these enter
the discussion
for the usual reasons the reason that it
was picked in that year was because
there were
Palestinian terrorist acts in which one
American was killed
okay that's a different story
so yes there's an easy and it can easily
extend this but a major way to stop
terrorism is to stop participating it
and that goes right to the present that
takes away the
Global assassination campaign if anybody
else was doing that we just call it
State terrorism an unimaginable State
terrorism and it elicits terrorism in
response
so you bomb a village and you know was
eristan and kill a couple dozen people
pretty soon
their cousin or uncle wants to come back
and kill you
and this is normal and we have plenty of
evidence that is all over I mean it
takes say one of the cases where
terrorism was actually
ended not just reduced but ended a
serious case a recent case in Northern
Ireland
the IRA was a terrorist organization
they were carrying out pretty serious
actions no joke you know practically
killed the whole British cabinet once I
was in Northern Ireland in 1993
went from Dublin to Belfast it was a war
zone
I met a lot of people and had contacts
one of the people I met was an IRA
Hitman
who was underground he had spoken out of
a British jail and he was in some place
where he was Secure so I was able to
meet him there through some civil rights
activists and we talked for a couple
hours I basically asked him what one
question what do you think you're doing
by killing Protestants and British his
answer was very simple
they killed my cousin I'm going to kill
their brother they're going to kill my
mother I'm going to kill their children
and that's how it's going to go
uh well a couple years later this guy
was on the negotiating team he's now in
the government
what happened is
here the United States played a good
role incidentally under U.S pressure the
British finally got it into their heads
that the way to deal with the rising
cycle of Ira Terror was not by more
violence but by paying some attention to
the legitimate Grievances and they were
there as soon as they started doing that
terrorism declined the negotiation
started I was in Belfast
a year ago
there's tensions like ethnic tensions in
any City but there's it's a peaceful
City not a war zone that's the way you
deal with the the minor amount of Terror
that they do
and dealing with a major amount of
Terror that you do yourself is by
stopping it
