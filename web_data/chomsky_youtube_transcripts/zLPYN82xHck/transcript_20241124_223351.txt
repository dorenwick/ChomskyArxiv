our aim is a student group is to be a
catalyst for forging an alliance between
Egypt and MIT and our objectives to
achieve this are threefold to support
the development of the Egyptian economy
technological industry scientific
progress civil society and
entrepreneurial spirit we also aim to
represent Egyptian culture on the MIT
campus and the Greater Boston region to
create a social community for Egyptians
at MIT and Boston and we've been
supporting these objectives through many
initiatives and events and we gave you a
glimpse of it in a brochure that you
probably received as you came in but we
would love to communicate with you and
keep you updated with what's all what's

2012 please give me help me in welcoming
professor Shoukri
friends colleagues and ladies and
gentlemen it is my pleasure to introduce
a gentleman tonight Noam Chomsky who
really needs no introduction but
protocol requires that he be introduced
so very briefly I shall do so and begin
by telling you what you already know and
that is Noam Chomsky is a distinguished
scientist a distinguished scholar and a
political philosopher at the present
time he is the professor emeritus of
link a professor emeritus of linguistics
at MIT what he has taught me all of his
career as most of you know he is best
known as the theories of transformative
generative grammar and in the process of
doing my research for this introduction
I've learned a lot about a
transformative grammar generative
grammar and now I won't
I won't share with you my understanding
of it with the theories right here I've
got more important items from MIT
perspective and that is that professor
Chomsky is an institute professor he
became so in 1976 and that is the
greatest honor that a faculty member can
receive at MIT for contributions
professional contributions scholarly
contributions as well as contributions
to the MIT community among other things
he has received ten honorary university
degrees from around the world and he has
been for a long long long time the eight
most cited intellectual in the
scientific literature and his clearly
as one of the most influential living
scholars in the world and before I turn
it over to Professor Chomsky let me just
suggest or tell you what the rules of
the game are for this is for this
evening questions please keep them as
concise as possible so that we can cover
as many questions as possible and the
second thing is if you don't mind it's
one question at a time so that we can we
can move on so thank you and with this
turn it over professor Johnson
the fact that I'm standing here in front
of a large audience and a big auditorium
may be misleading so let me quickly
allay any misimpressions
I'm here basically to open a discussion
I don't pretend to have any deep
understanding of the remarkable events
that have been taking place in Egypt in
recent years I follow them as closely as
I can
but haven't researched them deeply and
many of the sources the most important
ones ones that are in Arabic I haven't
had access to another reason for my own
hesitation is that I find myself in a
kind of surprising disagreement with
some of my old friends good friends in
Egypt people whose judgment I've always
respected and whose actions I've
regarded with much admiration I'll try
to explain why as I proceed first give a
quick review of some of the most
important events which I'm sure you're
familiar with so beginning in in January
2011 the uprising or some call it
revolution took place at tocker's square
was occupied set in motion a chain of
spectacular events that led very quickly
to the fall of the dictator us-backed
dictator many other achievements lively
political atmosphere opened up much
opportunity and which was made good use
of for freedom of association in
interchange speech some of the most
important achievements were scarcely
reported here
except in the specialist literature I
had to with labor rights a jib had had
quite a militant and active labor
movement for many years outside the
official framework there was an official
state union which as usual was more
committed to controlling the workforce
than working for their interests but
outside of the that institutional
structure there was militant labor
activism taking place it accelerated
roughly ten years ago as the neoliberal
programs were instituted more severely
as just about everywhere in the world
including here as these programs were
instituted they had pretty standard
consequences one was that they were
highly praised by the international
financial institutions World Bank and
the IMF US Treasury many economists and
they had numbers that looked good but
underneath the numbers they had the
usual consequences we're familiar with
them here sharply rising inequality high
very high concentration of wealth
elimination of social support systems
atomization of the population extensive
repression unbounded corruption usual
effects around the world which have led
to uprising almost everywhere in Latin
America they've led to actually
remarkable liberation of South America
from 500 years of Western dominance and
what began in the Arab Spring wasn't
started in Tunisia and in Egypt was in
part an uprising against the imposition
of the harsh neoliberal regime combined
with opposition to a brutal dictatorship
that of course the US was strongly
supporting the and there were major
achievements in late
writes very quickly the labor movement
was not initially directly involved in
the uprising Taher square occupation but
it began to join very soon and provided
a substantial mass basis for it a
general strike was one of the main
factors that impelled the militant
military command SCAF to decide to show
of the dictator mubarak the an
independent union was formed for the
first time outside the framework of the
legal structure that's broke the
monopoly of the state labor union the
involvement of the labor movement in the
uprising added social and economic
demands to the political narrow or
political goals and they also made
constructs substantive sudden of
achievements raises the minimum wage new
unions much else the main the major
scholar the scholar who does most of the
work on this Joel Bain and of Stanford
reviews it extensively and and points
out that one of the main achievements
was more perhaps more subtle it was
simply providing a human dignity and a
voice to people who had been so
suppressed and marginalized that they
had none all of that was of a great
concern to the United States and its
allies they don't like such developments
and that was particularly kind of
accelerated by the studies of public
opinion in Egypt at the time Egypt and
much of the Arab world
these were conducted by major US polling
agencies and they're certainly well
known to planners and elite elements
they were not reported and they barely
mentioned in the United States
in the media but parent mentioned but
they're interesting and revealing for us
and helpful for understanding the u.s.
attitude towards the developments that
have taken place a US official attitudes
and what in Egypt at the time of the
Tahrir Square occupation a major poll
taken by one of the main US polling
agencies found that about a very high
percentage of the population roughly 80
percent regarded the greatest threat
that they face as being the United
States and Israel they dislike Iran all
through the Arab world there's sharp
dislike of Iran but as elsewhere they
didn't regard Iran as much of a threat
maybe 10 percent regarded Iran is a
threat in fact the opposition to US
policy was so strong among the
population that a majority and Egypt
actually thought that the region might
be more secure if Iran developed nuclear
weapons to offset US and Israeli power
well if you have a really functioning
democracy the popular opinion is going
to influence policy and it's pretty
obvious that the United States doesn't
want these policies implemented and as
usual the fear of democracy guided much
of US policy both suppression of the
information for the public here but also
the policy actions that's actually quite
normal
the there were elections the elections
were won by Islamists mostly the Muslim
Brotherhood they had been the best
organized group for many years they were
illegal most of the time under the
dictatorship but they functioned and the
organization enabled them was one of the
factors that enabled them to win the
elections the other was that there was a
many splits in the secular
left-liberal quasi coalition which
actually got a majority of the votes
more than half of the Egyptians voted
for what was called a revolutionary
candidate candidate from those sectors
in the last summer's presidential
elections but there were six accredited
candidates from those groups and that
was split so the Brotherhood easily once
all office took a big role they imposed
a regime which was pretty harsh a SCAF
the military command maintained it's a
very powerful role in the dominating the
society the government made only limited
efforts to share shared governments
became quite unpopular by this year
there was a major uprising June 30th a
huge outpouring of people into the
streets petitions calling for the
government to resign a couple of days
later came the military takeover on July
3rd well that's part of the background
my own personal aspirations and
sympathies and in fact friends are
mostly with the mass popular June 30th
uprising movement but I think they're
making a serious error in their support
for the military coup or for many of
them even the outright denial that a
coup took place and in their faith in
the commitment of the military to defend
what they call the people against the
Brotherhood that's a term that should be
avoided the people are badly split maybe
you may not like the Brotherhood and may
not like their actions but they're there
and they're a substantial part of the
population and the people that can't be
written off so reference to the people
already tells you something's misleading
and the car
very severely so also mistaken in my
view is their faith that the military is
going to move to establish a democratic
secular regime I think that's highly
unlikely and much more likely is that
the military will act the way the
military acts everywhere and
historically in Egypt as well
it'll impose and has already imposed a
harsh brutal regime its aim will be to
reinforce their own power over the
political system and also to sustain and
their control over quite a substantial
economic Empire they'll crush dissidents
undermine civil and human rights it's
already happening my unpleasant
expectation is that my friends the
secular liberal left opposition that has
welcomed the military will are likely to
be its victims pretty soon as has
happened in the past and is beginning to
happen now one of the most best informed
international correspondence in the
region Patrick Coburn recently after
returned from Egypt that Egypt is on the
brink of a new Dark Age as the generals
close in for the kill with ten retired
generals and two police commanders from
the Mubarak era being appointed
provisional provisional provincial
governors Egypt is effectively under
military rule there is of course huge
support from Saudi Arabia and other
elements of the most reactionary parts
of the Islamic world the West prefers
them to the Brotherhood the West in the
United States like Britain before it
tended overwhelmingly to support the
most extreme radical Islamists in
opposition to secular nationalism for
understandable reasons and
so they don't happen to like the
Brotherhood particularly but that's a
different matter Saudi Arabia and the
Salafis are weighted to their extreme
side it's possible
Coburn predicts that this may lead to a
bloody civil war jobina and the
specialists on Egyptian labor rights
that security forces after the military
takeover that quickly crushed a militant
strike at the zoo I'm quoting him at the
Suez steel company located in the Canal
Zone city that not coincidentally was in
the vanguard of the revolutionary forces
that can build Mubarak to step down no
matter how popular the army may be at
the moment workers now face an
emboldened authoritarian state that is
openly hostile to their rights and
aspirations I suspect he's correct as I
said there have been real gains maybe
lasting ones but they're in danger and I
think the danger is quite serious right
now there are two major power centers
the one is Islamist the others the
military the latter very much in the
ascendance and with substantial left
liberal secular support which as I said
I think is a mistake two weeks ago a new
initiative was launched it's called
calls itself revolution path front the
main State newspaper Ella from describes
it as a new anti Brotherhood anti
military front launched to achieve
revolution goals contains well-known
political figures activists labor
leaders and others the spokesperson at
the press conference where they
announced themselves was a welcome all
is a quite an impressive young left
economist met him a couple months ago in
Egypt he he writes he said at the press
conference
it has been two and a half years since
the revolution began and Egyptians have
not yet achieved their dream of building
a new Republic that will provide them
with democracy justice and equality
millions have taken to the streets twice
the once in January 2011 to topple
Mubarak's regime which was based on
corruption and oppression and a second
time in June 2013 forcing Mohamed Morsi
to step down after losing legitimacy as
a result of the Brotherhood's attempts
to monopolize political life and rebuild
an oppressive system according to Al
Ahram the aim of the front is to work
for the redistribution of wealth achieve
social justice combat the formation of
an oppressive regime achieve equality
between citizens set the path for trends
transitional justice and adopt foreign
policies that guarantee national
independence if it does that also
guarantees us opposition to it is this
possible I don't know I hope it is I
think it looks like the best hope right
now to save Egypt from what might become
one of the darkest periods of its
history under military rule
so if you allow me I will I will make
stay there stay there
right there one one brief comment and
then a question my comment has to do
with the role of the the young people I
don't know how to put it the generations
younger many generations younger than
then then than the the older ones in
mobilizing in the in the early phase
it's a generation that's much more skill
much what it it but in tune with global
thinking and global processes and of
course access to communication so the
age structure should be in the dynamics
the question I have and depending on
your answer I may have a follow-up
question and that is are there any
conditions on any conditions under which
you might consider it plausible
acceptable I won't say good but
acceptable to have a military
intervention and a military coup well
you can imagine conditions but I think
there's a very heavy burden of proof to
be met by anyone who advocates military
coup anywhere in particular in Egypt
with the quite ugly history of the
military which incidentally is you know
persisted right through the Borsig
period and has been picked up again
afterwards the crushing of the Suez
strike is an unfortunate example well I
would be the last to to support or
endorse or say anything nice about any
military but there is one aspect we
haven't really touched upon I'll just
make a comment and not a question so we
can and over and this is
we have seen the very gradual but very
persistent loss loss of law of order of
any kind of police protection not that
there was much to begin with but the
indicator there is when individual
citizen carry their own guns and when
there's a private circulation of
weaponry for legitimate self-protection
then the textbook at least says that is
an indication of the erosion of the
social order and I for one would
consider that not a justification but if
there are no other institutions that can
provide to the normal citizens some
minimum minimum amount of security other
than the military in some ways it's
difficult to reject that now how to
contain that and how to make it
temporary and how to fire the military
after they've done their job is another
question so I think with that we can we
can begin addressing questions directly
to to professor Chomsky we have two
microphones and so thank you very much
if if the criticisms of the Morsi and
Muslim Brotherhood government are
legitimate to some significant degree
what might have been an alternative
direction to for people in Egypt to have
responded to their fears and their
insecurities and could it be that Morsi
made a political and strategic mistake
insofar as he may have as I understand
it accepted the neoliberal economic
policies that you made reference to
and connected with that a mutual friend
of ours who helped found partners in
health down the street here in Cambridge
is now the head of the World Bank Jim
Kim and so could you comment on the role
of institutions like the World Bank in
this ongoing scenario well that's a
couple of different questions it it's
true that the Morsi government
essentially continued with the
neoliberal programs whether that was a
mistake or not depends on your point of
view it was a mistake from the point of
view of the population because these
programs harmed them on the other hand
if he hadn't undertaken them the US and
its allies would move very quickly to
support his overthrow because that's the
condition that they require for
acceptance of a regime and the regime
was weak enough so it might have
happened as for Jim Kim who's a good
friend an old friend of mine he did take
on the president's the World Bank and I
think with eyes open and with hopes of
changing its direction and we'll have to
see you know how far he can achieve
those goals I don't personally criticize
him for taking it I don't think we you
know it's possible to just say I'm not
gonna I'm gonna dissociate myself from
all institutions because the too
oppressive and brutal and that's a
possible position but another one is to
try to find a way within them to
ameliorate their the worst actions and
effects and that's beginning to happen
with the IMF as well so the IMF for
example
was essentially pulled out of the troika
that has imposed this brutal austerity
program on mainly southern Europe and
the IMF is backed off in fact has come
out with studies arguing I think
demonstrating that the austerity
programs under recession of the worst
possible well okay there are economists
within the IMF who are pressing that I
think that's I don't criticize for that
as for the the first part of the
question about what alternatives were
there for the people first of all we
should be cautious it's not the people
it's a segment of the people that is
opposed to the Brotherhood and they
sell-off is what the exact proportions
are we don't really know one will inform
the very well-informed analysts I'll not
clash estimates that maybe a third of
the population supports the Brotherhood
and others the Salafis or even to the
more extreme end but it's split and the
question is what could the others have
done well there's some answers as I
mentioned in the last summer's
presidential election they split six
ways they had a majority but they were
too busy fighting each other to form a
coalition which could have won the
presidency
well there are other elections coming
and so far at least they hadn't been
they're not perfect by any means all
kind of things wrong with them but they
relatively speaking they were more or
less open elections and there's a fairly
open society so they could have
participated in that and taken a
parliamentary road to eliminating the
Morsi regime part of the reason why they
didn't I think is they were by no means
confident that they would be able to
follow that path but then I hear I don't
quote we don't agree in our assessments
but my feeling is that
- calling in the military to do it for
you
doesn't improve security it leads to
what we've in fact already seen first
real massacres of the Brotherhood
hundreds of people killed crushing of
strikes in the major areas and
imposition of the kind of regime you'd
expect from a military actually some of
you may have seen I'm sure you saw this
morning's newspapers long report of
leaks about the SCAF military
discussions internal discussions under
the Morsi regime when they were when
their power was being somewhat in
limited ways reduced they were subjected
to some degree of public scrutiny at
least and the discussions headed by the
new commander were designed to figure
out ways to overcome the fact that they
were under scrutiny and that their
economic Empire and political power
might be in limited ways overcome the
reduced and I think the coup was mainly
an attempt to ensure that that won't
happen I hope I'm wrong but I suspect
strongly that my own friends will be the
ones who will suffer from their support
for this action could I please stop the
next question to be concise and one
question quick hi professor Chomsky so
my question is do you think the
so-called stable countries of the world
may be complacent and not anticipating
such revolutions so can such revolutions
happen anywhere I don't hear very well
have been complacent the Western
countries in important in in
understanding what
happen discs happen anywhere in the
world if you mean the Western
governments the countries of the world
differ all over the place the Western
governments are by no means complacent
but they don't have the power that they
used to have now there are many I'm sure
you know there are rumors circulating in
the region in Egypt and in fact all over
the Middle East about the enormous power
of the United States it sort of runs
everything and in fact on both sides of
the divide in Egypt there are
accusations that the United States
supports the other side and is
manipulating and running everything the
same stories go on about Syria I think
that's very far from true the US and
even more so its allies have very
limited capacity to influence what's
happening some but limited and not in
the date like the days when they could
Institute military coos and so on and so
forth that's pretty much gone but
they're not complacent they have goals
so the United States for example is a
very concern about the interests of its
major allies its major allies are the
Saudi dictatorship and Israel and both
of them happen to be strong supporters
of the military regime and so yes the
United States for that and other reasons
I think is it will continue to support
the military regime not that it
implemented the coup it didn't but to
support the outcome particularly if the
military regime persists in the policies
it has so far initiated of attacking the
independent labor movement undermining
rights and so on that's the kind of
thing that the u.s. supports pretty
naturally the reaction to the poll
results I mentioned is a good example
actually just to go on with that for a
moment since we ought to be interested
in ourselves
it was very extreme
interesting to watch the elite reaction
to the what was revealed about the
attitudes in the Arab world WikiLeaks
released documents showing that the Arab
dictators some of them gave pretty
strong support to the US with regard to
Iran if you read the newspapers today
they'll talk with enthusiasm about how
the Arabs support the u.s. harsh US
position towards Iran well in fact it
was the reaction was so extreme that a
number of leading commentators in the US
and Britain Jacob harborin here get on
Rahman and Financial Times in London
actually started joking about how it
looks as though the CIA must be running
WikiLeaks because they released
information that's so supportive of US
policy well it's a slight footnote there
they were referring to the attitudes of
the dictators the attitudes of the
population are radically different but
for people who have real contempt for
democracy what the people believe just
is irrelevant what matters is the
dictators and if they support us over
these fine if the population believes
what I just reported that's an
irrelevance that's an important insight
into ourselves so sure they're watching
and doing what they can but what they
can has limitations sir thank you
professor Chomsky for speaking today and
thank you to the Egyptian Student
Association for holding this event I
just want to read you a quote and see
how you respond to former general Hugh
Shelton who said that general Sisi has
put an end to the the new Middle East
project had general Sisi not to post
Morsi Egypt would have become another
Syria and it's military would have been
destroyed that's a prediction for which
I don't see much basis as I mentioned
there were
opportunities within the parliamentary
system to continue to function there
were threats undoubtedly there was
repression much of it coming from the
military from the military itself under
the Morsi regime they were pretty they
did not back off from their harsh and
authoritarian behavior in fact you can
see it in the reports that were leaked
this morning and in their actions so yes
they were there but the still were
openings and don't see any indication
that it was going to turn into Syria in
fact I think probably the opposite
I suspect that Patrick Coburn is correct
in concluding as I mentioned that the
military takeover and the dark age that
it portends and the harsh a brutal
attack on the Brotherhood which is a
large part of the population whatever
you think about them may lead to a
bloody civil war that could conceivably
lead to maybe something like Syria maybe
worse but I don't think there were real
indications of it before then sir over
the past two or three years people have
witnessed both the Muslim Brotherhood
and the military in power and based on
that do you think we are going to have a
break from political Islam for the next
maybe 10 or 15 years and if this is the
case do you think the Western model of
democracy is the best path for Egypt and
Middle Eastern countries to for
modernity and development do I think
that democracy is the best path the
Western model of democracy well what's
the Western model of democracy is quite
anti-democratic we should be honest
about that so
I mean I couldn't a leet opposition to
democracy in the United States applies
at home as well we could talk about it
but if you mean the you know the
theoretical Western model the one that's
presented in propaganda and ideology
yeah I think that's a good model but a
powerful the concentrations of power
within the West and elsewhere don't want
it they want to hear they don't want to
need you is it the best model yeah I
think so I think that's why it's
constantly undermined I should mention
that there's nothing new about this for
those of you who want to learn about it
should look a little at the history the
United States happens to be a very open
society so have unusual access to
internal planning it's not used very
much but it's there so just to take one
illustration back over fifty years ago
in 1958 President Eisenhower in this is
Declassified long Declassified material
the president eisenhower raised a
question with his staff an internal
discussion he asked why is there a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not among the
government's which tend to support us
but among the population and that was
pretty surprising at the time because
this is 1958 and shortly before that
Eisenhower had intervened to kick of
Britain France and Israel out of Egypt
you might have thought that that would
have led to some support in the
populations of the Arab world instead
there was a campaign of hatred right at
the same time the National Security
Council highest planning body release
internally published a document a
detailed document if developments inside
the Arab world and what they said is
there's a perception in the Arab world
these are almost quote the perception in
the Arab world that the United States
supports harsh and brutal dictatorships
and opposes democracy and development
and that we do it because we want to
make sure we control their energy
resources okay and it went on to say
that this perception is more or less
accurate as indeed it was and that it's
probably the right thing for us to do so
yes there's a campaign of hatred and
that reiterates over the years you may
recall that President Bush right after
9/11 had a kind of pathetic speech in
which he asked why do they hate us no he
said well they hate us because of our
freedom and our wonderful so and so
shortly after that the Pentagon had a
research study done by a Research
Institute in the Pentagon defense
Science Board which came out with an
analysis of comment on Bush's speech and
essentially they reiterated what the
National Security Council had said back
in 1958 they don't hate our freedoms
they hate our policies they hate our
policy of undermining democracy support
undermining development supporting
brutal and harsh regimes because of our
interest in maintain controlling their
resources and there's plenty of
information in between that's says the
same thing including polls so I'd expect
them to but as to whether this would be
a good model yeah I think it would not
just for the Middle East but where
everywhere here too
in an email interview with Austin Mackel
you said there have been bills of
particulars offered by June 30 of
supporters varying credibility but I've
seen nothing to justify the calling in
the military to overthrow the elected
government however float
the elections or objectionable the
post-election policies so my question is
why were the bills of particulars of
varying credibility in your opinion and
why can't the people overthrow the
government if the elections were float
or the post-election policies were
objectionable and are you objecting just
the military interference or youth that
you thought that wanting to overthrow
the government was kind of premature let
me repeat what I think I understood I
didn't hear most of it if you want to
overthrow the government first of all
though I think that's legitimate sure I
thought it's very legitimate as I said
my sympathies and friends are with the
June 30th uprising but is the best way
to do with the coal in the military to
overthrow the government institute a
military dictatorship no I don't think
that's the best way there were if
there's absolutely no alternative and
there's a major attack going on against
the population you can imagine a
situation in which it might make sense
to appeal to the military to intervene
but I don't think anything like that was
true in Egypt particulars were very
why do I you said that the Bills of
particulars in June 30th were of varying
credibility I think I got that either
oh no I didn't no no I didn't say that
at all the bill of particulars of the
June 30th movement was mostly quite
credible
I think the charges against the Morsi
government were quite real pretty
accurate maybe not every word but
basically correct but the question is
given the opposition to the government
on the part of a very large part of the
population maybe a majority is the right
mechanism under those circumstances that
took all firm to support a military coup
which installs in power are much harsher
government what would have been the
alternative the alternative was to
pursue the openings that were not
pursued just a few months earlier in the
presidential election where the to
repeat theme you know this secular left
liberal forces not the coalition it did
have a majority of the vote but we're so
preoccupied with fighting one another
that they split the vote six ways okay
that offers opportunities overcome the
factional conflict internal to this
sector and move forward to participate
seriously in the parliamentary regime
which still was over flawed but open and
in fact some of the main threats to that
regime even under Morsi were the
military where
okay sir thank you I am my name is Dan
Lawrence and I'm with revolution books
and revolution newspaper and I wanted to
read a brief quote from Bob Avakian
who's the revolutionary the chairman of
the Revolutionary Communist Party you've
commented the essence of what exists in
the u.s. is not democracy but capitalism
imperialism and political structures to
enforce the capitalism and Pirie ilysm
what the u.s. spreads around the world
is not democracy but imperialism and
political structures to enforce that
imperialism seems to me that the
situation in Egypt is a perfect example
of that where on one hand you have the
reactionary fundamentalists and then the
other hand you have the military which
is part of the government which has been
funded and backed by the US for 30 years
and I'd like to kind of explore that war
in terms of this idea of what's involved
in the people overthrowing the
government well the quote from chairman
bob is a harsher version of what I was
saying I think too harsh a version I
mean I don't think the United States I
think that's a exaggerated picture of
what the United States is like and what
it does in the world but there's an
element of truth to it in fact it's
pretty much what the National Security
Council said in 1958 that we don't have
to go to Bob Avakian for that the the
rest of the question if I understood it
kind of it suggests that the United
States was somehow responsible for
imposing the Morsi government and the
military dictated in the military regime
afterwards and I don't think that's true
the United States supported Mubarak
strongly right up to the little ass
minute in fact what the u.s. the US what
the US policy was was kind of straight
out of a normal playbook it's kind of
intriguing that commentators here in the
media even scholarship didn't report the
obvious there's case after case where
the United States has supported some
favored dictator and at some point it
becomes impossible to sustain it because
maybe the military turns against him has
happened in Egypt and at that point
there's a playbook what to do is
proclaim your love of democracy make
sure the intellectuals echo it shelve
the dictator send him off somewhere in
Egypt that would send him off the show
no chef and then try to reinstitute the
same regime that's happened so often
it's almost a joke you know Somoza
Marco's do bad yeah yeah there's a heart
though Mobutu it's it's kind of routine
so yes that's what they did this time at
least there's consistency what there is
consistency consistently yeah it's
almost always that's a very rational
approach yeah you know very simple
there's no reason to be deluded by it
it happened so often we ought to just
kind of laugh when we see it again but
that's not the way it was presented
that's the job of the intellectuals to
conceal all of this from themselves and
from others but to believe that the u.s.
overthrew Mubarak is wrong they
supported him just as in the other cases
they didn't impose the Brotherhood
government they won because they were
better organized much better they had
functioned right through the
dictatorship let me just give you a
personal anecdote it's personal so it's
not a big story but
I was in Egypt about 20 years ago for a
while teaching at the American
University and while I was there I spent
a lot of time with activists
intellectuals one group was the kind of
the sort of the left really good people
good friends see document others really
good courageous people they'd struggled
hard they'd spent year minimum and spent
years and Nassif's prisons being
tortured very dedicated people now that
was the left where did we meet well we
met at a Nile River Boat if you know
anything about Egypt you know what this
is they have these river boats in the
Nile for very rich tourists and they had
a friend who owned one of them so we
were he gave them the River Boat for our
lunch and we sat in one little corner of
this thing and had an elegant lunch and
talked about how to carry out a
revolution in Egypt that was the left
later I met with a group of people who
called themselves Islamic intellectuals
actually they were about as Islamic as I
am one of them one of them was a cop a
cop that one of them was the former
editor of the Communist Party newspaper
but they declared themselves Islamic
intellectuals and we met in a small room
somewhere and talked and they described
what they were doing and I think
accurately they were trying to work in
the slums you know set up clinics small
stores organized people and so on that's
what they were doing the left
intellectuals were having elegant
dinners in river boats it wasn't hard to
see who's going to win and that's
happened all over the region this is a
personal anecdote but in fact it's been
going on all over the region and the the
Brotherhood won for that reason
primarily the United States didn't do
and the united states didn't overthrow
them united states was pretty happy with
the more city regime that was doing
pretty much what they wanted i think
they prefer the military regime partly
because their major allies are so
supportive of it but also partly because
it does carry out pretty harsh
repression like smashing up the strike
and Suez but that's my estimate we don't
have internal documents on this so it's
you know it's an impression please thank
you very much for doing this and I just
wanted to your previous comments kind of
touched a little bit on what I'm about
to ask and basically with the first
Revolution in January 2011 do you
believe the seeds of the current failure
were placed in that because the
revolution was incomplete they overthrew
Mubarak and the Parliament but they did
not get rid of the judiciary which was
also part of the Mubarak regime as well
as the current generals they were all
part of the Mubarak regime and you see
this when Mubarak was tried yeah he was
convicted but everything that was used
to convict him was thrown out setting
him up for an appeal which basically
shows that this regime was setting
itself up for a victory later on which
is what we're seeing right now that it
laid these seeds that it knew that the
first elected president was most likely
going to fail because of the almost
insurmountable problems but also because
of as was stated earlier lack of
security equals lack of stability the
military was very lacks in which writing
was very lacks in providing security
even down to the police forces the the
police weren't doing their job with
drones right yeah
it was so on such a skill that it was
almost appeared to be institutionalized
that they wanted security to fell so
that whatever government was in place
that was not part of the regime would
fell so my question would be do you
believe this is an accurate scenario and
how does Egypt move forward how how will
the next revolution take place and
overthrow all branches of government and
institute a true political democracy yep
I think you're quite right about the
fact that the military it retained its
force under Morsi quite a lot of it and
then he reduces some of the privileges
but not much they did try they were
quite happy with insecurity the police
were pulled out and in fact you saw what
happened the day the military coup took
place the day the military coup took
place the police were back on the
streets gas was available front before
that he couldn't get any guests for your
car
Saudi Arabia poured in tons of money and
the Gulf Emirates and it became very
clear if it wasn't before that there had
been every effort on the part of the
military and the ultra reactionary
forces in the Arab world mainly Saudi
Arabia and the Emirates to try to
prevent any regime from functioning they
hated the Muslim Brotherhood and and
then you know they kind of reinstituted
a sort of stability under a harsh
military regime once they had gotten rid
of the parliamentary opposition so what
is it you know that that's pretty much
what happened I think but the answer to
that is not to support the military that
just makes it worse no what was the end
was the answer well you know my
impression is that there were as I said
before there were plenty of openings to
pursue a unification of the sharply
divided
left secular forces left liberal secular
forces this big grouping and plenty of
differences within them but some kind of
grouping it could have gotten together
actually when I was in Egypt a couple of
months ago I met several of the
political leaders of these factions and
it was pretty clear they just didn't
want to cooperate with one another they
were more interested in fighting each
other than doing something about the
Morsi regime but that could have been
overcome and I hope that this new front
that was just announced that I quoted
from at the end which has some quite
good people in it may be able to bridge
those conflicts and create a unified
movement which would proceed if a
parliamentary openings are still
permitted by the military they may not
be the the related point here is first
remember that democracy political
participation call it democracy in this
case is involves bargaining negotiation
giving in and so forth and part of it is
learned behavior and there hasn't been
much experience in modern Egyptian
history for learning how to overcome
those divisions and so forth
keys Thank You professor Chomsky I have
a little question just about the
alternative again we have seen in the
year of the government of the Morsi that
the Muslim Brotherhood is nothing more
than Mubarak regime in terms of
political freedom in terms of Economic
Policy it the population I think I think
found itself between the extra dictator
and the new dictator and it has to
choose between a growing dictatorship
and a falling dictators
actually making an alliance with the
mana tree would be my better choice let
me disagree with you because they in
this year we saw how they simulated
their men in all that instead of local
administration in the governors of all
the off about half the governments of
Egypt were ruled by Muslim Brotherhood
that was for the preparation for the
next election so they were preparing for
a new dictatorship was evidence anything
I think so if I have to choose I would
never choose to to make an alliance with
the military the game which is falling
actually which just has to reform reform
reform with it answer relationship with
with the power again well first of all I
would suggest reformulating what you
said it's not the population that had to
choose it's a sector of the population
to which you belong on which I happen to
sympathize with but it's not the
population a large part of the
population supported the Brotherhood
another sector supported the Salafis
even more extreme you can't just write
them out of existence because you don't
like them they're there they're
important they're organized they're
based in the population in fact they
were so well organized that they were
able to win just about every
parliamentary choice that came along
partly because of the failures of the of
the Opposition secular liberal left but
they didn't do it and they're still
there maybe you can crush and murder and
destroy them but they're part of the
population so to reformulate your
question what could the sector's are
first of all I don't agree that just
factually that the Morsi regime was as
dictatorial and autocratic as the
Mubarak dictatorship there were real
achievements that were made by the
uprising revolution if you like I ran
through some of them the there was much
more freedom of expression of freedom of
publication meetings freedom
Association it was a pretty vigorous
lively political atmosphere that didn't
exist before and there were some very
concrete achievements particularly for
labor rights the formation of the first
independent union and in fact the dozens
of new unions was not a small
development the significant improvement
in the minute minimum wage which was
quite serious things were happening that
didn't happen under mubarak and couldn't
have happened and there were openings
for political action for example in the
last presidential election which may
have persisted to the next to the next
one if they had been pursued but given
the actual situation what should the
part of the population that you and
effect I associate ourselves with what
should they have done I think my feeling
is what I suggested they should have
overcome worked hard to overcome
factional differences agreed that work
together find a way to work together
participate in the openings that were
there and try to achieve a parliamentary
outcome which could then allow them to
carry forward their programs but I think
the worst thing to do is to call in the
military which is going to crush these
opportunities no I sir
I just want to refer back to 2011 when
the military got control after Mubarak
why didn't he call that a coop that's
number one
when the military took over after me
that was the military got involved and
they made an interim government at the
same time like the one
one that's happening now no one called
the coop question - why risk more see
it's one question please it's a very
very very new in this part of the
sentence of the first question as
Leblanc
otherwise nope it's really really simple
why why risk more see on the right
between the u.s. and Egypt why more see
this his dad pointed to do us and I
think this one - the first one the first
one is important I heard the first part
I don't get the Morsi question but he's
like why wasn't it a military coup in
March 2011 the military got involved
March 2011 yeah yeah so why wasn't that
a military coup
yes well because it was it was kind of
like the overthrow of Marcos or Somoza
we're at the last minute when the
military the military realized they
could no longer maintain their own
dictator they sent him off the pasture
and the they handed the government over
to a popular government that's not a
military coup it's a decision by the
military that we can no longer maintain
our own dictator and the best we can do
at the moment is subordinate ourselves
to a civilian government that's quite
different from a military coup thank you
for being here professor my question is
what is the relationship between
extremism and repressive social action
in an age of austerity in other words
how does Egyptian social action but
rests the extremist ideologies for
example say it could be him being in
prison led to an extremist ideology like
the Salafi positions or the food
so what you mean by extremely now I'd
call them extremists too you know but I
mean what's extremist depends on your
point of view I mean they'd probably
regard us as extremists you know um it's
not a descriptive term it's a term
reflecting your own position in some
kind of spectrum but yes from our point
of view they are extremists but then
what's the question right here on June
30th with 30 million people in the
streets and the majority of them wanting
Mubarak to step down and wanting the
same results that they got from the
January 25th revolution I in no way
support the military coup but what do
you think would have been a solution in
that situation on that day on June 30th
well first of all I'd be kind of
skeptical about the numbers as
independent observers are but there's no
doubt that were plenty of people in the
streets there was a large popular
uprising the proper move at that point I
think I'll just repeat it would be to
use that momentum to overcome the
destructive stultifying divisions
factionalism in the kind of left liberal
secular sector and to put forth a
unified opposition which would
participate actively in the openings
that were plainly there not to call in
the military which is going to put a
damper on all of it and in fact remember
the military itself was responsible for
a substantial part of the repression
under the Morsi regime bringing them in
is not a sensible step I mean I have to
say it what I said the beginning my own
friends good friends in Egypt the people
I really
respect disagreed quite sharply with
what I just said so I say it with
hesitation but that's what it looks like
to me sir hi do you think in the future
it will be possible for the left to work
with the Islamists or at least - do you
think could be possible for the left the
more secular segments of society to work
with the Islamists in the future or at
least tolerate each other and if not how
big of a problem
would that be well certainly at the
moment at least as far as I can see at
the moment there don't seem to be open
opportunities for that what might happen
in the future who knows so it takes a
Latin America different situations but
just take that as a model I mean for
centuries the Catholic Church in fact
since the fourth century had been the
Church of the persecutors the church
that has supported autocracy power
violence and so on in 1962 with Vatican
tube that changed the Vatican - was an
effort to under pope john xxiii
to reinstitute the gospels in the
catholic church it was a radical act
because the gospels are a radical
document that's why Christians were
persecuted in the first couple of
centuries they tried to introduce what
was called the preferential option for
the poor the message of the Gospels it
was taken up in Latin America by priests
nuns laypeople tried to organize
peasants and so on that what happened
the United States went to war with them
initiated a vicious war against the
church left a long string of
murder of corpses many of them religious
martyrs and it's left that as part of
that was the overthrow of the
parliamentary governments in solution
institution of dictatorships Brazil
Uruguay and Chile the massacres in
Central America in the 1980s and in 1989
with the murder of six leading Jesuit
intellectuals in the university and El
Salvador by an elite battalion armed and
trained by the United States fresh from
training at the John F Kennedy
counterinsurgency school in North
Carolina following the orders of the
military top command to murder the
Jesuits name one else it was around okay
that was the war against the church just
a couple of days ago another step was
taken the current ultra-right Archbishop
of El Salvador it disbanded a to tell
Allah God that's the legal office of the
church during the heresy the period of
the heresy when they tried to restore
the Gospels there was a research agency
of the church and El Salvador tutela
they go which compiled information on
the murders the atrocities the killings
and so on a couple days ago it was
disbanded by the archbishop I'm sure
with us support the war still goes on is
that possible in the Muslim world maybe
and it would have the same response
professor Chomsky thank you for joining
us today and thank you for a lifelong
Allah a long life of contribution to the
advancement of social justice and
political activism and thank you for the
Egyptian students
your thoughts
my question is regard is regarding an
environmental issue in Egypt at the end
of morsi's year long regime he tried to
consolidate a bitterly divided public
opinion by addressing the potential of
extreme threat of limiting Nile use and
Nile access so what potential do you
think that future regimes will have in
consolidating and swaying public opinion
on a unifying issue like the Nile River
access as well as using that to the
advantage of their political it's quite
an important issue in fact came pretty
close to a war with Ethiopia over
damming then of the sources of the Nile
and that's remains a live issue I don't
know maybe you can say something I have
no idea how that can be resolved I think
it's a very difficult latent problem
there are other ways that could that
these issues could be approached
actually one of them was suggested by a
student at MIT a couple of years ago
forgotten his name there was a student
in the mechanical engineering department
here or some of you may know him
egyptian student who worked on a project
to develop a very cheap easily
accessible solar energy it was
essentially small sort of reflectors
made out of materials that you could
consider that Egyptians could construct
themselves didn't require importation of
you know high-tech equipment according
to his thesis at least and the professor
who worked with him it was a feasible
approach Egypt the in fact North Africa
altogether
the air is pretty clear it's not heavily
polluted plenty of sunlight they
estimated that they couldn't
this was spread over the country and
over North Africa they could have enough
energy resources to even supply Europe
little including their own well that's
another path of development is that
feasible you go to the mechanical
engineering department here and ask them
what they think why they gave him a PhD
for yep in respect to the mobilizing
youth military crews an additional
curtin involvement of the West do you
believe there is any similarity with
Iran and the potential scales of
government and/or resistance or do you
think that it's grown to be impossible
with Egypt to repeat it slowly yeah in
respect to the mobilizing youth the
military in Rome and the coos and the
general Curtin involvement of the West
do you think there is any similarity
with Iran and the potential potential
scales of government or resistance or do
you think that Egypt has or that idea
has become impossible for the conditions
of Egypt which idea the idea of
resistance in general the general with
regard to resistance to the government I
mean it's quite a different structure
Iran has they're both right I mean echip
tin the past couple of years has been
fairly open by regional standards like
maybe aside from physique Tunisia may be
the most open country but now it's
closing down with the military regime
Iran is a different story it's under the
rule of a very harsh clerical regime
it's not Egypt where it's not a clerical
regimes anti-clerical regime but it's
pretty pretty rough but it does have
there still are openings the last
election was limited you know like every
candidate in the Iranian election has to
be vetted by the clerical Council you
know the clerics so you can't just have
any candidate running which is of course
intolerable but shouldn't surprise us
very much we have a similar system in
the United States every candidate has to
be vetted by concentrations of private
capital if you can't put together
billions of dollars you're not a
candidate so we don't have clerics
vetting the candidates we have Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan Chase and the Koch
brothers and so on vetting them the
which is wrong in both cases but
something but something took place that
wasn't just kind of the population did
participate and it was the outcome was
kind of a surprise the you know the most
not very but the most reformist of the
admitted candidates won pretty easily
and there are some changes people in
Iran at least the ones I can hear from
are pretty happy with it
well there were more openings than that
in Egypt and could they have been
pursued I think they could have been
that will they be possible in the future
well we'll have to see depends what the
wets gaffed what the militaries want to
permit Thank You professor much has been
made about the role of social media in
the events in Egypt and indeed
throughout the Arab world what's your
assessment of the influence of social
media and has its a has its effects been
overblown she's the expert on it so I
shouldn't talk about I'm it's obviously
they there was an effect how big the
effect was I think it's not so clear in
my opinion so for example there was a
point at which Mubarak closed down the
Internet to try to block the
use of the Internet for organizing
activism and so on it didn't stop the
activism it just took another form and
in fact a pretty effective form through
other forms of direct communication so
yes they're useful but it's not a I
don't think it's a revolutionary change
you can many uprisings have been carried
out and succeeded without the internet
before the Internet
it can be used effectively it can also
be used as we know as a technique of
control and domination let's take a look
at the Snowden revelations the power
systems anyone corporate or state are
going to use whatever technology they
can get their hands on to try to control
their domestic enemies the population
we're seeing it very dramatically here
so it's a double-edged sword it's true
of most technology you know can be used
to oppress can be as deliberate sir many
people who need to pray now would think
it's the right time for the current
regime to make a change of direction
with regard to international policies
and make a shift to the east and
establish a powerful relationship with
Russia and China like it used to be
during the sixties there was a very
powerful relationship between Egypt and
the Soviet Union do you think this is
happening like China would be a big ally
for Egypt in the next 10-15 years China
certainly has interests in the region
but for the time being there they appear
to be primarily commercial and
that's true all over the region so for
example one of the effects of the
overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya was to
drive out probably tens of thousands of
Chinese engineers oil prospectors and
others who were investing there
replacing by Westerners maybe something
could happen in Egypt I don't know of
any indication that China has any great
interest in substantial investment in
Egypt doesn't you know Egypt doesn't
have major resources the way say Libya
did or the Congo June 25th 2011 was
police day in Egypt and was also
arguably a turning point in the
revolution as it saw the mass
mobilisation of anti regime forces sorry
yeah
so I'm afraid to police stay in 2011
which was June 25th it saw mass
mobilization of anti-regime protesters
and was arguably a turning point in the
early days of the revolution I'm
wondering if you believe that this
October 6 which will be the Armed Forces
Day in Egypt presents a similar
opportunity for people discontent with
the government not only the pro-morsi
forces but also anyone else who does not
agree with the current regime to
mobilize and if you think that this will
also become a turning point in the
modern events in Egypt in a couple of
days yes this Sunday well I mean I don't
you know I don't know of any indication
of it maybe you do like if there are
people here who follow the that blogs
and in Egypt or the press in Egypt in
Arabic they might have some indication
of this but I haven't seen anything well
what I understand this is through
secondhand and I miss must have could
have misinterpreted but the second hand
can have the right to clarify and that
is that the some unification that the
not-so-legal Muslim Brotherhood might be
engaged in making its presence felt
again by slowing down
just operations of the system but in
terms of violence I haven't heard
anything it's very unlikely that the 6th
of October will go by unnoticed so
that's what we the only indications I've
seen are the ones I mentioned the new
revolution path front which grows out of
something that was called the third
square there was a informal development
prior to this of what was called the
third there were two squares there was
tough career square which was by then
mostly military and there were the
Islamist
square where they were organizing and
there was a third square which included
many of these people and they have now
formed themselves into some kind of a
unified front which covers a pretty
broad range of activists and groups how
far they can go I don't know I
personally like their policies but and
the people but I just don't know how
much popular support they can get
mobilized personally I just want to
thank you for coming to speak on this
topic my question has to do with the
division in the population and how you
say that you see it unlikely for the
Islamists and the secular left to begin
to cooperate I'm wondering if you see
any way for us to begin to bridge the
gap in order to minimize the lack of
security and the day to day violence
that all Egyptians are suffering from
regardless of their political views in
Egypt is there a possibility for the
competing blocks to get together and
cooperate yes just in terms of
minimizing the lack of security I'd like
to believe it but I think that the
direction in which things are going or
more like what
coburn described towards what could turn
out to be a bloody civil war what you're
suggesting would be very welcome and you
know there always are possibilities but
at least I don't see anything happening
in that direction okay I ask you a
question do you see anything optimistic
energy at all yeah I think what's
optimistic are the lasting achievements
of the initial Tahrir Square uprising
including what I mentioned again a much
more lively political atmosphere
empowering of people what Joel fine and
pointed out giving people a sense of
dignity and voice and the concrete
achievements mainly partly political
participation which was a real
achievement but partly the labor
movement which is very significant I
think the establishment of the first the
first institutional break with the
Mubarak regime the very first was the
establishment of the Egyptian the
Egyptian independent trade union
federation that's significant before
that there had been no officially
recognized independent Union now it
broke that monopoly and since then
there's been plenty of significant labor
activism and the major centers major
textile centers industrial centers Suez
that's why the military clamped down so
hard but it's still there
and I think these are in fact one of the
main labor leaders Kamal Abbas is part
of this revolution path front I don't
know how many others are involved hasn't
been much evidence but but I think those
are so far lasting achievement can you
go on from there I think that's
optimistic Thank You professor mine is a
little broader question so
we saw that in Libya I took a civil war
for the transition from an opera scene
to a democracy what we see today the new
system in Egypt it took the intervention
of the military against Syria we've seen
a civil war my question is that for for
an autocracy / dictatorship in the
Middle East can there be an alternative
route for transition to democracy that
does not involve a civil war or a
military intervention can is there an
optimal route apart from what we have
seen so far and there be in the Middle
East
democracy uprising without military
intervention in a civil war I mean the
duties the dubious roots that we have
seen so far that have brought more
damage than benefit can there be an
another optimal route well I would put a
little differently
can there be moves towards democracy
with military intervention I suspect
probably not military intervention I
think is gonna tend to block it there
have been steps forward without military
intervention the in the original
uprising Tucker Square the only military
intervention was to decide that they
can't sustain their own dictator any
longer so they'll send him off the
Shamal shaft with us support and try to
restore some degree of power that's not
military intervention unfortunately the
military was not tamed and controlled
and now it's taken power again but
wherever the military intervenes I think
it's almost inevitably going to be a
regressive step but there have been
there was progress in Egypt I think some
of it is some of it remains it's
threatened but it remains a Tunisia same
story another the governing Islamic
party has just kind of backed off in the
last couple of days in fact seems to be
allowing more openness of participation
I think that's a good thing
in Syria what began as a democratic
uprising was crushed by brutal violence
and became a vicious Civil War which is
driving the country to suicide it
doesn't have to happen in in the
dictatorships the oil dictatorships the
ones that the US and its allies really
care about there were some Saudi Arabia
in particular there were small efforts
to join the Arab Spring very small so
calling uh you know some some something
on Friday the so-called days rage yeah
but I was crushed so quickly that people
in Riyadh were afraid to go out into the
streets in eastern Saudi Arabia where
the where most of the oil is and it
happens to be a large Malaysian there
have been continual uprisings brutally
suppressed us back said of course and
Bahrain kind of the same not much and
the other emirates those remained what's
called stable they were the military
regimes clerical military regimes were
able to crush steps towards popular
uprisings but it may not be forever it's
only that's not the only case the Arab
Spring actually began in a place that is
rarely discussed Western Sahara Arab
country it's the last colony in Africa
it's under UN jurisdiction it's supposed
to undergo decolonization and there's
been what happened as as soon as a move
was made toward decolonization I think
1975 i Morocco invaded because they want
it and started sending in lots of
Moroccans to try to overwhelm the
domestic population pretty harsh
repression and war in some ways similar
to Palace
at the opposite end of the Arab world in
must have been in October 2010 there was
a an uprising in Western Sahara Tent
City and the major in the capital with
efforts to try to impose reforms the
Moroccans crushed it very quickly the
sorrow is the native population that
took it to the UN Security Council which
is responsible for decolonization in the
last colony it was blocked in the
Security Council by France which is
Porter of Morocco with us support but
that was the first uprising in what
became the Arab Spring is that finished
not necessarily a similar questions
arise in Palestine which is also
basically colonized so we not wait to
have our final question why there has
been an escalated anti Hamas propaganda
in the Egyptian media lately that
surpassed the level that it was in the
Mubarak regime and what level did Hamas
play and the Egyptian politics
throughout the Morsi regime the area
Hamas propaganda and the ad upon
Palestinian propagated in general under
the current military regime that's
pretty pretty striking it wasn't so
great under Morsi I mean there were some
hopes or expectations that under Morsi
there might be a kind of an opening to
Gaza because you know the Hamas is kind
of an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood
so it was anticipated that there might
be some opening of the border very
little I mean I was actually there last
October and the border was pretty
tightly closed it had opened somewhat it
was a little easier for people to get
through but
the sharp restrictions on even flow of
just humanitarian aid like medicine that
continued and it was still necessary to
for the gazans to try to survive on the
tunnel economy you know the a lot of
tunnels going under the border the Morsi
regime shortly after that went beyond
Mubarak in flooding the tunnels with the
sewage to try to block them it's kind of
biological warfare even Mubarak hadn't
done that but there were in general it
was very little there was a little but
not much of an opening now that the
military's taken over has just become
like what you described very
surprisingly kind of fanatic anti
Palestinian and anti Hamas propaganda
with all kind of fairytales about how
Hamas was carrying out terrorism and the
Cairo and in the Sinai this doesn't seem
to be any reason to believe any of that
even if they could have done it which
they can I I'm not sure why that's going
on I suspect it's a method of trying to
mobilize the population around something
some foreign enemy which has a kind of a
Muslim Brotherhood type connection they
were an officer to the Brotherhood well
with that we'd like to thank professor
Chomsky and professor chakra
it has been a pleasure and we will see
you next event and thank you very much
for coming
