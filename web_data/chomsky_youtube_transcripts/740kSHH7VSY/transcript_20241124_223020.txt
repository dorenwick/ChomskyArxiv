we are here today
to support
umar khalid
student activists who
spoke up
against the
discriminatory
citizenship
laws
caa
nrc
he was charged with terrorism
and instigation of riots
the only
credible evidence
that has been presented
is that he was
exercising his
constitutional right to speak and to
protest
a fundamental
prerogative of citizenship in a free
society
khalid was arrested
held without bail for
over a year
despite the insignificance of the
charges
khalid remains under
court-ordered constraints
for the long duration of trials
on what the government claims were riots
from this distance
i'm in no position
to evaluate the events
and the charges
in this particular case
of course
it is however
one of many
that shed a grim light
on india's
system of justice
during a period of
repression
and often violence
that has been visibly undermining
free institutions
and the free practice
of the rights of citizenship
it's part of the
large-scale
government effort to dismantle
india's honorable tradition
of secular democracy
and to impose a
hindu
ethnocracy
greatly the secular democracy
created in india
and its recovery from
brutal and destructive
british rule
has been praised as one of the great
achievements
of the modern age
the recent regression
is therefore
deeply saddening
we can only hope
that the courageous
defense
of freedom
and justice
on the part of the
many young activists
will succeed
in reversing this tragic course
and pave the way
for enter his return
for leadership
for a in the search for a better world
one that honors peace and justice
drawing from india's rich and impressive
traditions
