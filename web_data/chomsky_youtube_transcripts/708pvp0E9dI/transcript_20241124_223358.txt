well we don't want to impose any brand
of democracy abroad the best allies of
the United States and England and the uh
Arab and Muslim worlds have been brutal
dictatorships and still are uh in both
Britain and the United States have a
long history of supporting uh extremist
radical Islam as a barrier against
secular nationalism which is what
they're really afraid of it's a very
good good study coming out on British
policy Mark Curtis's latest volume on
British foreign policy but the same is
true of the United States I mean the
most extreme radical islamist state is
Saudi Arabia and it's in fact the center
of uh uh creating the uh a culture of
jihadism it's not it's not an accident
that the 9/11
uh the bombers mostly came from Saudi
Arabia or that osam Bin Laden did uh
yeah that's the culture that they've
been U uh dist Distributing the madrasas
in Pakistan and so on with strong us and
Israel and British support uh Pakistan
as well Pakistan and you know Saudi
Arabia became this St State Centers of
Jihadi style terrorism main allies and
there's a long record of this
this is just a small part of it in fact
us and British support for Israel comes
largely from the fact that uh
Israel destroyed secular Arab
nationalism and defended Saudi Arabia
that's that was the background for the
1967 war when uh US policy towards
Israel shifted radically through its
present form uh and I everyone knows
that in the
1980s the United States Britain helped
tried to
organize radical the most extreme
radical islamists it could find all over
the world uh to send them to Afghanistan
and to train them and not to liberate
Afghanistan that would have been a
legitimate objective or but to kill
Russians in fact that was made explicit
CIA station Chief in Pakistan who was
running it said look we're not going to
liberate Afghanistan it's not our
interest we're going to kill Russians
okay that's what you want to do yeah uh
meanwhile Reagan and Thatcher were
happily watching madrasas Saudi Arabian
funded madrasa spread over Pakistan at
creating the culture of jihadism funded
by Saudi Arabia uh uh under the most
brutal dictator Pakistan has ever had
therefore the greatest friend of
Thatcher and Reagan Huck also watching
him develop nuclear weapons and
pretending they didn't know so that you
could keep aiding him and so on so a
terrorism is suppressing terrorism is
just not a high priority of States it's
easy to demonstrate this actually the
invasion of Iraq is another example I
mean when the US and Britain invaded
Iraq uh they were aware I mean that is
very likely to increase terrorism in
fact that was the analysis by
intelligence agencies experts and so on
and it happened terrorism increased by a
factor of
seven uh in the year following the
invasion according to US Government data
well yeah but it's just not a high
priority so terrorism is a real thing
and if you want to deal with it there's
a couple of ways of doing it one way is
to stop your own terrorism that makes a
big dent in it uh uh the other is to
stop uh supporting the resources that
encourage it uh another is to pay just
to do what the British finally did in
Ireland pay a little bit of attention to
the Grievances that lead people to give
at least sympath sympathy or sometimes
direct support for terrorism and in
those and uh terrorists of course
criminals so find the criminals
apprehend them give them Fair trials and
so on that's the way to do it uh none of
this is being done I mean just take Fair
trials
and Guantanamo probably created more
terrorists than than Osama Laden ever
did yeah sure that's the way to do it if
you want uh but uh to say that they're
trying to combat terrorism is just a
joke
