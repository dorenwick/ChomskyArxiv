University was built is the traditional 
territory of the Haudenosaunee and  
Anishinaabe peoples, many of whom 
continue to live and work here today.  
This territory is covered by the Upper 
Canada Treaties and is within the land  
protected by the Dish with One Spoon wampum 
agreement. Today, this gathering place is home  
to First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples. It's 
a great honour for us at McMaster University,  
the Centre for Scholarship in the Public Interest, 
and the Wilson Institute for Canadian History to  
welcome Noam Chomsky here this evening. Dr. 
Chomsky will present a 30-minute talk titled  
"Rethinking the Civic Imagination and Manufactured 
Ignorance in the Post Pandemic World", followed  
by an interview with Dr. Ian McKay, the L. R. 
Wilson Chair in Canadian History that will draw  
from Dr. Chomsky's recent book, "The Precipice: 
Neoliberalism, the Pandemic and the Urgent Need  
for Social Change." Throughout his entire academic 
life, Noam Chomsky has used his knowledge, skills,  
and stature as a public intellectual to 
advocate for radical social and economic changes  
in societies that have failed to live up to the 
promises and ideals of a socially just society.  
Professor Chomsky has rightly argued 
that intellectuals, artists, educators,  
cultural workers, and others have a responsibility 
to address grave social problems such as the  
threat of nuclear war, ecological devastation, and 
the sharp deterioration of democracy. He is well  
aware that oppression feeds on mass apathy and 
manufactured ignorance. In response, his academic  
work and public interventions have become a model 
for enriching public life and addressing economic  
inequality, needless wars in class, and racial 
injustices. He has worked tirelessly to inspire  
individuals in social movements to unleash the 
energy, the insights, and the passion necessary  
to keep alive the spirit, promises and ideals of 
a radical democracy. As a public intellectual and  
border crosser, he draws upon a wide variety of 
disciplinary fields, pushes at the frontiers of  
the public imagination while reminding us 
of the need to feel and act upon a passion  
for a commitment to a free, just, and equal 
society. He rightly insists that in the end there  
is no democracy without informed citizens and no 
justice without a language critical of injustice.  
He has made clear that we live in dangerous 
times and that there's an urgent need for more  
individuals, institutions, and social movements 
to come together in the belief that the current  
regimes of tyranny can be resisted, that 
alternative futures are possible, and  
that acting on those beliefs through collective 
resistance will enable social change to happen.  
Professor Chomsky's work is infused with a 
vision that merges a sense of moral outrage  
with the need for civic courage and collective 
action. His work is more indispensable than ever  
because the world is more dangerous than ever. I 
believe that the great playwright Arthur Miller  
captures the spirit of Noam's work when he wrote, 
"writers speak the unspeakable and the closer you  
get to it, the more real it is, which is part of 
making life possible for those who come after."  
It is my great honour to introduce Professor 
Chomsky, an international treasure and one  
of the world's most important scholars and 
critically engaged public intellectuals. He  
has written numerous books including one of 
his most recent, "Consequences of Capitalism:  
Manufacturing Discontent and Resistance", which 
I am now using in class, and he currently teaches  
at the University of Arizona. It is my great 
pleasure to welcome Professor Noam Chomsky.
Thank you very much, Henry. Well in 
the preliminary discussions we've had,  
many very searching questions have been 
posed. I would like to try to touch on them,  
inadequately of course, as a way of setting 
the stage for thinking about it and discussion.  
Well perhaps I can start with something that 
sounds quite remote. You probably know about the  
Fermi paradox posed by the great physicist 
Enrico Fermi. It's very brief. The paradox is:  
where are they? His discipline of astrophysics 
demonstrates that there's a vast number of planets  
accessible to us with conditions similar enough 
to Earth so that they should be able to support  
life, over time intelligent life, maybe even super 
intelligent life. So where are they? With the most  
diligent search we cannot find the slightest hint 
of their existence. Well, one answer that's been  
offered in a morbid gist is that they're out there 
but when they come across humans they decided to  
get away from that crazy place as quickly as 
possible. Could see some justification for that.  
Another answer in the same vein but more serious 
is that intelligent life in fact developed  
but proved to be a lethal notation and 
quickly destroyed itself. Actually we know  
of only one case: humans on Earth. We are a new 
species, only a few hundred thousand years old.  
That's a blink of an eye in evolutionary time and 
we seem to be intent on establishing the thesis.  
There have been reasons for such 
suspicions since August 1945  
when we learned that human intelligence had 
devised the means for self-annihilation. Not  
quite yet but it was clear that the day was not 
far off when technology would reach that point.  
And it did. It came a few years later in 1953 
when the United States and then the Soviet Union  
exploded thermonuclear weapons. In acknowledgment 
of this achievement of human intelligence,  
the hands of the famous doomsday clock which seems 
to encapsulate the world's security situation,  
the hands were advanced to two minutes 
to midnight. Midnight is termination.  
Well, the hands have oscillated since. They 
did not reach two minutes to midnight again  
until halfway through the Trump 
administration. In its final years,  
the analysts abandoned minutes altogether, shifted 
to seconds. We're now at 100 seconds to midnight.  
Let's take a closer look at what leads to these 
conclusions. We are currently facing a confluence  
of severe crises, something that has never 
happened before, anything like this in the brief  
period of human history. To each of these crises, 
we know of feasible solutions. In each case,  
we are rejecting the solutions and racing to the 
precipice, some of us more rapidly than others.  
To be more precise, it is not we who are racing to 
the precipice. Rather, it is those whom Adam Smith  
called the "masters of mankind". In his day, that 
was the merchants and manufacturers of England.  
In our day, it's multinational corporations, 
financial institutions, other concentrations of  
private power, and the governments that 
are in no small measure at their service.  
On the matter of service to the masters, 
evidence is compelling. Illustrative  
cases are regularly on the front pages. Right now 
for example, as you know, the US Congress is now  
debating a major program which among other things 
may be the last chance for the United States  
to take serious steps to arrest catastrophic 
global warming. The fate of this measure is  
largely in the hands of the Chairman of the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,  
who happens to be the champion of the Congress 
in receiving funds from fossil fuel industries.  
He's now demanding sole jurisdiction in the Senate 
over the 150 billion dollars clean electricity  
performance programs. That's Joe Manchin and 
he can get what he wants. The Senate is split.  
Republicans half are a hundred percent 
opposed to dealing with the climate crisis  
so the fate of the legislation rests on unity 
among Democrats. The chief recipient of fossil  
fuel funding, the Democrat, can ensure that 
nothing will be done to harm his donors  
and he's clear about it. His official 
position is innovation but no elimination,  
no cut back on fossil fuel use. That's 
straight from the handbook of the ExxonMobil  
public relations department. If the denialist 
party returns to power next year as they will may,  
we'll be back to racing to the abyss as 
quickly as possible, picking up from the  
disastrous Trump years. Well it may seem like 
this is an aberration, just one case. It's not.  
And the history is revealing. The Republicans 
were not always a denialist party.  
In 2008 when John McCain was running, 
they were moving towards mild,  
insufficient but mild, global warming legislation.  
That their shift to total commitment to cataclysm 
results directly from fossil fuel funding.  
Specifically, juggernaut by the huge Koch brothers 
energy conglomerate when it sensed signs that the  
Republicans were veering towards recognizing 
that we are destroying the prospects for civil  
survival of organized human life on Earth and 
harming short-term profits for the masters.  
The juggernaut was successful. Cut the heresy 
off completely, decisively. All Republicans  
turned and haven't changed. Now that's not an 
aberration either. A good deal of research in  
mainstream academic political science which 
has demonstrated a remarkably close correlation  
between electability and campaign funding. 
Specifically, strategic business-based campaign  
funding. And similar scholarship has independently 
established the immediate corollary of this,  
namely a large majority of voters are 
literally unrepresented. There is no  
correlation between their views and the votes of 
their representatives. The representatives are  
listening to different voices as they must if they 
hope to be re-elected. Well it's called democracy.  
Blocking of legislation that would harm the 
fossil fuel industry is not a malady specific  
to the United States. It's worldwide. In fact, 
let's consider what's happening right now again  
on the front pages. As we meet, governments of 
the world are pressuring oil producers to increase  
production. They've just been advised in the 
August IPCC report, by far the most dire yet, that  
catastrophe is looming unless we begin immediately 
to reduce fossil fuel use year by year,  
effectively phasing it out by mid-century. 
Petroleum industry journals are euphoric  
about the discovery of new fields to exploit 
as demand for oil increases. The business  
press debates whether the US fracking industry 
or OPEC is best placed to increase production.  
You can readily add examples from where you're 
sitting. That's some of these pages now.  
They all know that they are racing to catastrophe. 
We don't have to instruct them, they know it very  
well. Furthermore, at least if they're minimally 
literate, they all know that there are feasible  
solutions to the climate crisis which will 
furthermore create a more livable world.  
But profit for the rich and political 
expediency come first. Come first, that is,  
for the masters and their servants. What about the 
general population? Well that's a complex story.  
Let's take Joe Manchin's state, West Virginia, 
coal mining state. Not long ago it was a  
bastion of working-class militancy. The 
United Mine Workers representing the  
coal miners in West Virginia and elsewhere, they 
have recently adopted a program, a transition  
program, that would shift production towards 
renewable energy with better jobs and better lives  
all feasible, worked out in detail. 
But those are people, not the masters.  
They're a bitter enemy and the relentless class 
war conducted by the masters has a different view.  
The class war, one-sided class war, has been 
continuing with mounting intensity in the past  
40 years of the neoliberal assault on the 
population. That merits a few words. Let's go  
back to the 1930s, happens to be my childhood. 
I remember it very well. The world was facing  
serious crises. There were several ways 
out. Continental Europe turned to fascism.  
In the United States, a rising militant 
working class with a sympathetic president  
turned to social democracy, the New Deal. Later, 
post-war Europe moved in the same direction.  
That led to what in Europe is called the 
Trente Glorieuses, 30 glorious years, and what  
economists call the golden age of capitalism in 
the United States. Fastest growth rate in history,  
egalitarian growth rate, lowest quintile as 
well as the highest quintile. Plenty of flaws  
but economically, socially has enormous success. 
The business world resisted from the first moment.  
But until the 1970s, they were unable to reverse 
the course. By the late 1970s under Carter  
in the United States, the business 
offensive was making progress. In 1978,  
the president of the United Auto 
Workers, Doug Fraser, withdrew from a  
Carter-initiated management labor board. He 
withdrew and condemned the business leaders,  
I'm quoting him, "for having chosen to 
wage a one-sided class war in this country,  
a war against working people, the 
unemployed, the poor, the minorities,  
the very young, and the very old, and even 
many in the middle class of our society."  
And having broken and discarded 
the fragile unwritten compact  
previously existing during a period of growth and 
progress, the New Deal years, the golden age under  
Reagan and Packard, early 80s, the one-sided class 
war took off full steam. The first acts were to  
smash unions using illegal methods like strike 
records, opening the door to the corporate sector,  
inviting them to follow suit. Very effective over 
the years, severely weakened the unions. They  
understood or at least their planners understood 
that it was imperative to deprive working people  
of the main means of defence against what 
was to come. And for those with eyes open,  
what was to come was never in doubt. And go 
back to Reagan's inaugural dress. His main  
principle which he stated is the government is 
the problem, not the solution, meaning decisions  
have to be taken out of the hands of government. 
They don't disappear. They go somewhere else.  
They go to concentrations of private power. That's 
a great advantage. The government has a flaw,  
it's partially responsive to the general 
population. Concentrated private power is  
totally unaccountable so it's a much 
better basis for decision making.  
This was amplified by the economic guru of 
the neoliberal assault, Milton Friedman. He  
came out with his principles article, giving 
his credo. Corporations have no responsibility  
to the public, only to maximizing profit, and of 
course salaries for management. But the right to  
incorporate is a gift granted by the public with 
lots of benefits. If you don't want the gift,  
you can keep it a partnership. But having accepted 
the gift, corporations have no responsibility.  
So, put that together. Decisions 
are shifted from the government,  
partially responsive to the population, 
to unaccountable private tyrannies  
which have no accountability and are responsible 
only for maximizing their own profit and the  
salaries of CEOs and management. Doesn't take 
a genius to figure out what's going to happen  
and in fact after 40 years even the mainstream 
institutions are starting to take a look.  
So the super respectable RAND 
corporation, quasi-governmental,  
recently did a study of what they politely call 
the transfer of wealth from the middle class  
and the working class, lower 90 percent of the 
population, transfer of wealth to them to the  
very top. When you look closely, it's mostly to 
the top fraction of one percent of the population.  
Their estimate is about 50 trillion dollars in 
40 years. It's not small change and it's a vast  
underestimate. They did not take into account 
the other means of robbing the public that were  
developed when Reagan and Thatcher opened the 
spigot and said "rob as much as you like".  
So you're looking at the newspapers today, you 
can read about the Pandora Papers, huge trove of  
papers showing how the ultra rich use various 
gimmicks that were illegal prior to Reagan to  
stash away huge amounts of money in 
places where they don't have to pay taxes.  
It's only a small part of it. The world's 
largest corporation, trillion dollar corporation,  
has its offices in Ireland, very low 
tax rates. Others play the same game.  
Now all of this was illegal prior to Reagan and it 
was the law, it was enforced. Treasury department  
was conscientious in enforcing the laws. There 
are many other similar devices, shell companies,  
changes in rules of corporate governance 
so that CEOs can pick the board that picks,  
that sets their salaries, and guess what 
happens from that? Of course that lifts  
salaries have skyrocketed, especially in the 
United States, that carries all management  
salaries up with it. So you get if you added up 
probably 70-80 trillion dollars of robbery of  
the public, putting most of it in the hands of the 
top fraction of one percent. In fact the top 0.1  
percent of the US population has increased 
their wealth from 10% to 20% of the total.  
Not quite at that extreme elsewhere but something 
like it. Perfectly obvious consequence of the  
policies that were announced in 1980. Meanwhile 
for the general population, stagnation or decline.  
Up until the late 70s, the minimum wage and 
the real wage tracked productivity. That ended  
with the neoliberal assault. Productivity 
and growth increased, the wages stagnate.  
Real wages in the United States, some supervisory 
workers, are actually less than they were in 1979.  
Meanwhile, services have been cut back under 
the principle that government is the problem. A  
majority of the population pretty 
much lives from paycheck to paycheck,  
can't pay for COVID vaccinations, too much 
of a copay, cutback of other services,  
precarious existence. Maybe you'll be called to 
work next week, maybe not. Maybe you'll be called  
for double time. Okay. That's the result of 40 
years of sheer highway robbery. Now the claim is  
this has to do with markets. Not quite. What 
has been created is what economists call  
a bailout economy. One of the things that was 
done under Reagan was to deregulate, including  
deregulation of the greatly expanding financial 
institutions. That immediately leads to crashes.  
What happens after a crash? The public politely 
comes and bails you out. And that's a fraction of  
it. The government has a tacit insurance 
policy, it's called "too big to fail".  
That means that the big guys, the big financial 
institutions, the big banks, and so on can get  
cheap credit. They can take out risky loans 
which are profitable. If anything goes wrong,  
no problem. That's the bailout economy. So 
it's markets for the poor and the working  
class and the middle class, but it's powerful 
government intervening constantly for the rich.  
That's a one-sided class war. Working people in 
the poor are to suffer the ravages of the market.  
The masters have to be protected by a powerful 
state. Many other ways. Clinton joined in one  
way with what are ludicrously called free trade 
agreements, which are radically protectionist in  
a manner that has absolutely no precedent. It's 
why the prices of drugs go sky high, most of the  
world can't get vaccines, protected by the rich 
countries, mainly Europe in this case, but have  
to preserve the profits of the masters with a 
highly interventionist radically protectionist  
global and local system except for the poor, 
the working class and the middle class. They are  
thrown on the market. Go across the channel, 
the Atlantic to Thatcher. It was the same.  
Her mantra as you remember was: there is 
no society. You survive somehow on your own  
unless of course you're among the 
masters, then there's a very rich society.  
Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, 
American Legislative Exchange Council,  
corporate-funded which imposes business-friendly 
programs in state legislatures which are easily  
manipulated and bought off, trade associations, 
and more. So rich society for the masters,  
nothing for the rest. One-sided class 
war. Well the consequences have been  
profound. That's quite apart from the vast highway 
robbery of the public. The assault has engendered  
anger, resentment, conspiracy theories about 
hidden powers that are causing your malaise,  
anti-vaxx movements, the United States literally 
killing hundreds of thousands of people and a  
lot more. It's also created fertile terrain for 
demagogues of the Trump variety who are capable of  
holding up a banner with one hand 
saying "I'm your protector, I love you",  
while the other hand stabs you in the back. 
There's been one legislative achievement  
of the Trump administration: the tax scam of 2017. 
Sheer robbery. Sharp cutback of taxes for the rich  
corporations, imposing of course a higher 
tax burden on everyone else. But that's kind  
of quiet. You don't talk about that in public. 
There have also been a sharp attack on democracy.  
It's an obvious consequence of policies I 
described. Steps towards a kind of proto-fascism  
or all the way some analysts argue. Well there 
are very sober and respected voices sounding the  
alarm about the possible collapse of American 
democracy with dire consequences for the world.  
Among them are leading commentators of the world's 
leading business press, the London Financial  
Times, to warn that the United States is being 
driven to autocracy or worse by what they call  
a radical party with a reactionary agenda which 
ranks alongside the far-right European parties  
with neo-fascist origins. Should say that all 
of this is tragically ironic for people whose  
lives have been framed by the transition from the 
1930s with the US in the lead in social democracy  
to tpday where it's in the lead and moving towards 
proto-fascism. Well that's a bird's eye view of  
where I think we are now. It's not graven in 
stone. Plenty of counter forces. On climate,  
most crucial issue, it's mainly the young. It's 
a terrible indictment of my generation when  
Greta Thundberg stands up at an assembly of the 
masters at Davos and says, "you betrayed us".  
She was right. The words should be seared into our 
conscience. It's not too late but we do not have  
much time to hear these words. Well, 
that's the crisis of global heating,  
which is actually one aspect of a much broader 
environmental crisis, habitat destruction,  
industrialized agriculture, destroying the 
land, much else, which feeds directly into  
the COVID crisis, incidentally. But 
let's turn to a different crisis,  
a comparable one, the one that was initiated 75 
years ago, the threat of nuclear war now growing  
very seriously. One of the reasons why the 
doomsday clock is moving to seconds not minutes.  
There have been slow steps for 60 
years towards an arms control regime  
that would limit the threat of nuclear war. It 
has been virtually dismantled by this century's  
radical party with a reactionary agenda, the 
Republican party. George W. Bush took time off  
from invading countries to destroy the ABM 
Treaty. Trump's wrecking ball took care of most  
of the rest, though Biden was able to rescue the 
New START Treaty hours before it was to expire,  
accepting finally Russian offers to extend 
it. The US is of course far in the lead  
in global military power, swamps all potential 
adversaries combined. It's also well ahead  
in the mad race to develop even more 
dangerous weapons and to extend the  
yearning for global suicide to space. 
The US has incomparable security.  
It's not the way it's perceived in high places. 
Threats everywhere, gravest perceived threat  
to the US is China. That deserves some thought. 
The China threat is very well described  
by the distinguished international diplomat Paul 
Keating, former prime minister of Australia,  
right within the reach of the dragon's claws. 
I'll quote his words. The threat of china  
is the fact that somehow the rise of 20% of 
humanity from abject poverty into something  
approaching a modern state is illegitimate. 
But more than that, by its mere presence,  
it is an affront to the United States. It's not 
that China presents a threat to the United States,  
something China has never articulated 
or delivered. Rather, its mere presence  
represents a challenge to United 
States preeminence. Hard to deny.  
The major point of contention right now is 
freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,  
or that's the way it's described. It's 
not accurate. It's accurately described by  
a leading Australian strategic analyst Clinton 
Fernandes. As he explains, the conflict  
concerns military and intelligence operations in 
China's exclusive economic zone, which extends  
200 miles offshore for every country. The United 
States holds that military intelligence operations  
are permissible in these exclusive zones. 
China holds they're not permissible.  
India agrees with China's interpretation. 
Recently, it vigorously protested US military  
operations in its exclusive zone. These exclusive 
zones were established by the 1982 Law of the Sea.  
The United States is the only maritime 
power not to have ratified the law. It does  
say that it will not violate it. The law bans the 
threat or use of force in the exclusive zones.  
The controversy has nothing to do with freedom of 
navigation, which is not threatened in the least.  
It has to do with whether military intelligence 
operations constitute a threat of force.  
United States says no. China, India, 
others say yes. Well surely this is a  
clear case where diplomacy is in order, not highly 
provocative actions like sending in a naval armada  
in a region of considerable tension with the 
threat of escalation possibly without bounds.  
But it is crucial to establish US preeminence 
everywhere, even off the coast of China,  
which we are led to believe unlike the US 
faces no threats. Surely no threats from the  
nuclear-armed missiles in the US military 
bases off China's coast, among the  
800 military bases the United States has 
around the world, but China has one. The nature  
of the China threat is further elaborated by 
Australia's preeminent military correspondent,  
Brian Toohey. It's worth quoting in detail to help 
understand world affairs so listen, I'll quote it.  
"China's nuclear weapons are so inferior that it 
couldn't be confident of deterring a retaliatory  
strike from the United States. Take the example 
of nuclear-powered, missile-armed submarines.  
China has four. Each can carry 12 
missiles, each with a single warhead.  
The subs are easy to detect because 
they're noisy. According to the US  
Office of Naval Intelligence, each is noisier 
than a Soviet submarine first launched in 1976.  
China is expected to acquire another four 
that are a little bit quieter by 2030.  
However, the missiles on those subs won't have 
the range to reach the continental United States,  
they would have to reach suitable 
locations in the Pacific Ocean.  
However, they're effectively bottled up inside 
the South China Sea. To escape, they'd have to  
pass through a series of US chokepoints where they 
could easily be sunk by US hunter killer nuclear  
submarines. In contrast to China, the United 
States has 14 Ohio-class missile-armed subs.  
Each can launch 24 Trident missiles, each 
containing eight independently targetable warheads  
able to reach anywhere on the globe. That means 
a single US submarine can destroy 192 cities,  
or other targets, compared to 12 for the Chinese 
submarine. The Ohio class is now being replaced  
by the bigger and more devastating Columbia 
class." Well in order to break this imbalance,  
the US is now sending Australia advanced hunter 
killer nuclear subs which Australia will pay for  
so they'll be incorporated in the US naval command 
. This sale of advanced nuclear subs abrogates  
an agreement between France and Australia for 
sale of conventional subs. It's a serious blow to  
French industry. Washington did not even take 
the trouble to notify France. It was instructing  
the European Union on its place in the 
US global order. US runs global orders.  
Brian Toohey observes further that 
Australia's submission to the United States  
does not enhance its security, quite the contrary, 
and further points out that the nuclear subs  
sale has no discernible strategic purpose. 
The subs will not even be operational for  
probably 15 years, by which time china will 
surely have expanded its military forces  
to deal with this new military threat. The 
sub agreement does serve a purpose however  
to establish more firmly that the United States 
intends to rule the world even if that requires  
escalating the threat of war, possibly terminal 
nuclear war, in a highly volatile region,  
and of course eschewing such specified measures as 
diplomacy. Well these steps to escalate conflict  
take place against the background that's plain and 
stark. The United States inherited the mantle of  
global dominance from Britain and proceeded to 
substantially extend its reach far more powerful  
than Britain ever was. China's a rising power 
bound to play a major role in world affairs. The  
crises we face are all international. Pandemics, 
destruction of the environment know no borders,  
nor does nuclear war. The US and China will 
either cooperate in addressing these crises or we  
are doomed. It's as simple as that. Cooperation is 
surely achievable just as the other crises we face  
have solutions that are within reach. The 
question we face now is whether we have the  
will to save ourselves from cataclysm or whether 
we will choose to show that higher intelligence  
really may be a lethal mutation, providing 
an unhappy answer to Fermi's paradox.
Thank you very much, Dr. Chomsky 
and I just want to repeat what  
Henry Giroux said in his introduction. It's 
a great honour to welcome you to McMaster  
and to the Wilson Institute. And after I pose 
my questions to you, we shall select a few from  
audience members as well. And while I'm asking 
my questions, audience members can pose them  
starting now using the chat function on YouTube. 
So my questions tonight are all based on your 2021  
book, "The Precipice: Neoliberalism, the Pandemic 
and the Urgent Need for Social Change", brought  
out by C. J. Polychroniou. In it, you elaborate on 
the confluence of crises of extraordinary severity  
with the fate of the human experiment quite 
literally at stake. So here are my six questions.  
First of all, among some theorists critical of 
capitalism, there's been a recovery of a theme  
developed by Marx which is called the metabolic 
rift, the way capitalism systematically depletes  
nature of elements necessary for the 
planet's equilibrium. For such theorists,  
there aren't distinct climate 
change and pandemic crises plural,  
but rather one overall multi-dimensional 
environmental crisis stemming from the disastrous  
impact of capitalism upon the natural world. Do 
you consider this a promising line of inquiry?
Oh yeah, I had that question in mind which was 
sent to me when I hinted at the fact briefly that  
the global warming is part of a much broader 
environmental crisis. That's the metabolic  
rift. Destruction of habitats, which of course 
enhances pandemics, industrialized agriculture,  
industrialized meat production, not only 
savage and brutal but a huge effect on global  
warming and even more, something else I didn't 
mention. One of the crises that we're facing,  
not talked about much except in the medical 
literature, is antibiotic resistant bacteria.  
We're coming to a point where going to a hospital 
is becoming dangerous because there are bacteria  
mutating which antibiotics can't deal with. 
Well the drug companies don't much work on that,  
it's not really profitable, but they're mounting. 
And the reason they're mounting, one major reason,  
is industrialized meat production. You cram cows, 
chickens in impossible circumstances in a tight  
place. Diseases are going to spread. Well you're 
a good capitalist, you want to maximize profit.  
So what you do is pump them full of antibiotics. 
A huge proportion of the antibiotics that are used  
are used basically for that reason. Of 
course the antibiotics lead to mutation,  
pretty soon you're getting antibiotic resistant 
microorganisms. Could be, it's been warned that  
in another 20 or 30 years, 
surgery may be impossible  
and other advanced medical procedures but you have 
to make money tomorrow. That's crucial. Doesn't  
matter what you do to the world's population, to 
the huge number of species that we're destroying,  
to animals, to the environment - have to make 
profit tomorrow. And this generalizes. So yes  
it's a very profitable line of inquiry but 
we have to remember something. Time scales.  
That's critical. The crises that we face have 
to be dealt with today. It's today that the  
leading democracies are urging the fossil fuel 
companies to increase production when the leaders  
all know certainly that we have to start 
decreasing production if we hope to survive,  
but not if you want to improve your electoral 
prospects or make more profit for the drug  
companies. That has to be done now. We 
can't wait for the capitalist system to be  
replaced by something more humane, just concerned 
with people's needs instead of profit. Can't wait  
for that and that's true of the other crises 
too. All of them have to be dealt with quickly.  
We're on the verge. I don't have to go 
through the details, it's pretty obvious.  
They have to be dealt with now. That means working 
to modify the more destructive aspects of the  
savage capitalism of the past 40 years. It's not 
utopian to say that we could go back to the kind  
of capitalism that Dwight Eisenhower advocated. 
It's not super utopian. In the United States,  
it's not utopian to say that we could rise to 
the level of the conservative party in Germany.  
That's not a joke. Take a look at Bernie Sanders' 
programs. One of the editors of the Financial  
Times quipped that in Germany he could be 
running on the Christian Democrat program.  
It's literally true. Universal health care, 
free higher education, all over the place,  
Mexico, Germany, Finland, everywhere 
you look. But for the United States,  
that's considered radical. That's part of the 
extraordinary power of business in the United  
States which has shifted the spectrum, 
has fought against the New Deal bitterly,  
shifted the spectrum far to the right. Well 
that's not utopian to say we can overcome that.  
In fact, it's being battled right now in 
Congress. Right now, the Biden programs would  
move a little bit towards, back towards the kind 
of more moderate capitalism of earlier years. Some  
limited social democracy being fought 
tooth and nail 100% by the Republican party  
and by the so-called moderate Democrats who 
should be called reactionary Democrats, the  
ones who are awash in corporate funding. They'll 
probably kill it. That's maybe the last chance to  
do that. So we have to solve the problems within 
the existing system. Meanwhile we can be working  
hard to raise understanding, awareness of the 
deep flaws in the system that have to be overcome  
and also developing institutions which 
are the seeds of some better society.  
Worker-managed enterprises, for example, 
cooperatives which do flourish in Canada,  
not here, localism and so on, all at the same 
time. But the time scale can't be overlooked.
Thank you. One distinctive theme I really 
appreciated in The Precipice and in your comments  
tonight and I think it sets you apart from a lot 
of other leftists is your sort of sympathetic,  
compassionate treatment of working-class North 
Americans who are tempted by conspiracy theories  
and right-wing demagogues. You really are 
saying that in a sense they have some cause to  
be aggrieved and they're sort of being lured into 
a trap by a, you know, supremely capable con man.  
How would you respond to critics who might think 
you're being too soft on grassroots Trumpians  
and their reactionary politics?
Well I don't feel that I'm on some high 
moral pedestal in which I can condemn other  
people. I'm not living their lives. I didn't 
have to suffer the precarity of existence,  
the stagnation of wages, the decline of 
services that they suffered. I'm privileged,  
okay. I mean problems like I suffer from the 
health system like I've had the problem of  
not being able to get to a hospital because 
they're overflowing with unvaccinated COVID  
victims. But that's not like what 
poor and working people suffer.  
The last 40 years have been a disaster for them. 
And it's the same in England. I mean I think  
the working class vote for Brexit in my 
view is suicide but you can understand it.  
They want to grasp something. Maybe we can grasp 
the fact that we can use British currency again.  
We can feel proud of something. I don't think 
that's very smart but you can understand it and i  
don't feel like condemning it. If you take a look 
at the Trump voters here in the United States,  
that's been very carefully studied. 
The best work is by Tony DiMaggio,  
left social scientist who's done very detailed 
work. Turns out that the prime base for the  
Trump popular base is petty bourgeois. Relatively 
affluent small businessmen, insurance salesmen,  
guys who own a construction business, 
rural, Christian, white supremacist,  
traditional. They feel their country's being 
taken away from them by minorities. There's even a  
theory of the great replacement. The 
democrats are trying to get immigrants here  
so they can undermine the white population. 
The great replacement, that's one of the  
wild conspiracy theories that's around. Well take 
a look at, take a trip through rural America.  
You can understand it. Jobs are gone. 
Factories are gone. Young people are leaving.  
Stores are boarded up and 
maybe the bank is boarded up.  
Still some churches. Not much future for 
you. It's declining. It's an elderly,  
Christian nationalist, traditional, 
white supremacist population.  
There was a wonderful, that's largely mythical, 
but there's at least a myth about a wonderful  
traditional life where the coloured people 
knew their place, women knew their place,  
none of this craziness of same-sex marriage, 
other things that these terrible minorities  
are doing to us. All being taken away. So okay 
in those circumstances oh march on the capitol,  
these are the people who marched on the capitol. 
Not working people. These are the people who  
marched there saying I'm going to save my country 
by taking back Congress away from the people  
destroying the country. Do I approve of it? Of 
course not. But I think we can understand it and  
we could also understand our role in creating it. 
We tolerated 40 years of the neoliberal assault  
okay. It has a devastating effect on the 
victims. We're in no position to condemn them  
as deplorable. They are, but not without reason. 
So that's the way i feel about it. Incidentally,  
it's not basically working class. One of the 
things that he showed in his work, DiMaggio, Tony  
DiMaggio, is that the working class was not won 
by the Republicans. It was lost by the Democrats.  
That's where the shift is. Many of the 
Trump working class voters voted for Obama.  
He totally betrayed them, totally. So what 
are they supposed to do? In fact I could see  
it in Massachusetts where i lived at the time. 
Mostly liberal state. 2008 Obama was elected,  
wonderful promises. 2010 he'd betrayed the working 
class totally by the way he handled the bailout  
for the rich, not for the poor, not for the 
victims. By 2010 there was a by-election.  
Replaced Ted Kennedy, the liberal lion. Even 
union workers didn't vote for the Democrat.  
They'd been betrayed, stabbed in the back. Why 
should we vote for these guys? They're just a  
party of rich professionals. They don't care 
about us. Well that's the way you lose voters.
I wonder if I could ask a question about 
what you call the neoliberal assault.  
This phenomenon known as neoliberalism which we're 
studying closely at the Institute and we have  
several good graduate students working on this, 
but they're really suggesting to me that there are  
these various ways of defining neoliberalism. Some 
of them saying it's an all-encompassing logic of  
rule, others say it's just a specific tradition, 
a school of economics, the Chicago school.  
Some see it as a particular version of a 
globalized trade regime and others see it  
as an updated version of ruling class strategies 
to rob the working class essentially. Would I  
be right then in thinking that you know from 
your comments tonight and the book that are you  
essentially inclined to that last thrust which 
is it's a new variant of a perennial ruling class  
scheme to basically deprive workers and you know 
it's very much a class-based attack on working  
class more than the other themes that other 
scholars are raising or would you like to put them  
all these strands of interpretation together and 
have a tilt towards a class-based interpretation?
I'd go along with Doug Fraser when it 
was taking off. So one-sided class war.  
The business classes are basically Marxists,  
vulgar Marxists, they don't bring the 
sophistication to it. But they're fighting a  
bitter one-sided class war using many techniques. 
None of this has to do with the Chicago school.  
That's cover. Chicago school doesn't say you 
should have highly protectionist trade agreements  
which you call free trade agreements. Chicago 
school doesn't say you should bail out  
the big institutions and give them a government 
insurance policy so they can be predatory.  
That's not Chicago school. And Milton 
Friedman, I'm sure knows it. This is when  
Milton Friedman actually should notice that 
the Chicago school had a chance. They had a  
chance under perfect experimental conditions 
in the first 9/11. We don't call it 9/11.  
9/11 1973, much worse than 9/11 2001, but since we 
were the perpetrators it's not in history. Well,  
imposed a vicious brutal dictatorship, opened 
the door, huge amount of funds flowing in,  
investors loved it. Working class was crushed, 
popular dissent was crushed. The Chicago boys  
came in. Milton Friedman's students, Friedrich 
Hayek, all the big shots. Ran the economy,  
perfect conditions, couldn't have any protest, 
the torture chambers took care of that. He had  
money pouring in from the wealthy all over the 
world, the international financial institutions.  
They were smart enough to depart from doctrine by 
keeping intact the nationalized copper company,  
Codelco. Highly efficient nationalized copper 
company which was in fact the base of the economy.  
So they put away the textbook and left that in 
place. Absolutely perfect conditions. Within  
about five years, they had crashed the economy 
totally. The government had to take over more  
of the economy than it held under Allende. 1982 
Wags called it "the Chicago road to socialism".  
But they didn't care. By 1982, they were on 
to bigger game. Let's take the whole world.  
Let's take the whole world and put 
it under our one-sided class war  
masquerading as libertarianism. So I think that's 
a good definition of neoliberalism. Define it by  
its practices not its rhetoric and the practices 
were perfectly obvious from the beginning.
I really like what you said about Brexit 
and about American working class people  
wanting to believe in their nation and kind 
of gut patriotism. In Canada, I think some  
of our nationalism derives from taking gleeful 
pleasure in the troubles of the United States.  
I really deplore those tendencies and 
so I really appreciated your pokes at  
Canada and you take a few pokes at Canada in The 
Precipice, describing our so-so medicare system  
which is not really a world leader in terms 
of its comprehensiveness or sophistication.  
And also the Alberta tar sands and other 
mega projects. So granted that your book is  
not about Canada, I was wondering do you think 
there is a place for progressive nationalism  
in a future global left and how do we 
read it of this kind of need to other  
nations and to basically dwell upon you know 
the schadenfreude, the joys of schadenfreude  
and watching other nations go through difficult 
times? To me, it's a very ethically problematic  
politics and yet it's everywhere in 
Canada. Do you want to comment on that?
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember the exact words, 
but there was a well-known Canadian diplomat.  
I think his name might have been John Holmes 
or something like that. He once described the  
Canadian way. The Canadian way is to stand up for 
your principles and make sure you violate them.  
He put it more eloquently. I've seen 
the effects of Canadian foreign policy  
even in my own experience. I've 
spent time in southern Colombia,  
one of the most brutal vicious parts 
of the world. Horrible atrocities.  
Visiting poor villages where they're desperately 
trying to preserve their water supplies  
under the attack of Canadian mining corporations 
who want to destroy the virgin forest,  
the hills, make profit by killing poor people in 
Colombia. That's all over the world. They're the  
scourge of the Earth, Canadian mining companies. 
As far as Canadian foreign policy is concerned,  
attracts the United States. You may recall 
Lester Pearson, the Nobel Prize winner. He was  
one of the revelations in the Pentagon Papers 
was that in the negotiations volume, which  
Dan Ellsberg didn't release at first, when Johnson 
was planning to bomb North Vietnam in 1964,  
he consulted with the allies. So he consulted 
with Canada with Lester Pearson. Pearson said  
he didn't think it would be good to use 
atomic weapons but iron bombs would be fine.  
That's the Canadian way, stand up 
for principles, no atomic weapon  
okay, but bomb the [ __ ] out of them you know and 
in fact Canada was serving the United States as  
basically the US spy in the 
international commission there.  
So there's plenty to say about Canada. By US 
standards, it's civilized. It's not very high bar.
I really noticed throughout The Precipice 
how many times you make implicit but also  
explicit references to Antonio Gramsci and as a 
fledgling Gramscian, I really appreciated that.  
But I was wondering if you could comment on 
a theme that Gramsci develops is the modern  
prince which he wants basically a cohesive party 
aiming to build an effective and inclusive state.  
Libertarian leftists have historically been 
skeptical of any such state socialist project.  
Yet the pandemic to my eye 
seemingly shows the need for  
states with the capacity to plan the economy, 
institute comprehensive social security,  
and prevent future pandemics. So is it time to set 
aside this libertarian skepticism of the state?
Well I don't know exactly what 
the libertarian skepticism is.  
Does it say that if you don't feel like stopping 
at a red light, you should drive through it?  
Especially if there's an old woman pushing 
a shopping cart there? I don't want to be  
inhibited. Why should I have the state tell 
me I have no right to do that? I haven't heard  
that from libertarians. There happen to be vaccine 
mandates which have been in place for a long time  
in schools. Can't send your kid to a school unless 
he gets a polio vaccine, measles vaccine. So is a  
libertarian supposed to say I want to send my kid 
to school and kill those other kids because i want  
to be free of state control? I haven't heard 
that recently. In fact, the question is not  
are there general controls. It's who puts them in 
place. Is it the community, a democratic community  
which gets together, deliberates, says we want to 
put these in place because it's for our benefit?  
Well that's libertarian socialism. It's not US 
style libertarianism. Right-wing libertarianism,  
which says private power does whatever it feels 
like and the rest of you find a way to survive.  
It's what was called libertarian socialism, 
the libertarian wing of the socialist movement,  
basically anarchism and ... It had nothing to do 
with what's called libertarianism today. Actually  
an interesting measure of the extent to which 
democracy functions in a society is the attitude  
towards tax collection. It's a very striking 
measure. So if you live in a totalitarian state,  
when tax day comes along, you're furious. They're 
robbing you. April 15th in the United States,  
they're robbing us. I want to find a way out of 
it. Suppose you had a democratic society. Imagine  
a democratic society. A society where communities 
get together, decide here's what we want for next  
year for ourselves, schools, roads, decent air, 
water, and so on. Let's figure out how to pay  
for it. Here's an equitable way to pay for it. 
Tax day comes along, it's a day of celebration.  
It's a day of celebration of the fact that we were 
able to work together to get what we all want.  
Now it's interesting to place 
societies in that spectrum.  
You get an interesting conclusion of 
the extent to which democracy functions.  
It's worth thinking about. So I don't think the 
issue is the horrible state is imposing mandates.  
It's we get together, decide we want to protect 
each other, so we decide we want to protect  
workers in restaurants. I think they deserve 
to be protected, so therefore we decide that  
the restaurant should be able to have a vaccine 
mandate. I want to protect them. It has nothing  
to do with a powerful state imposing anything 
else if it's a democratic society of course.
My last question is, it's 
kind of a general question,  
but in The Precipice you're asked how one can 
fight right-wing authoritarianism and if I can  
quote you and it's a wonderful quote, you say the 
familiar advice, easy to state, hard to follow,  
but if there's another way it's been kept a 
dark secret. Honest, dedicated, courageous,  
and persistent engagement. Hard work, necessary 
work, the kind that has succeeded in the past  
and can again. So you know I really like the way 
that you are balancing a kind of sense of what is  
possible but how you know urgent and hard the work 
is going to be. "Pessimism of the intelligence,  
optimism of the will" would be how Gramsci would 
put it. How best can we combat not just right  
wing authoritarianism but what I would call kind 
of the ambient despair I'm sensing among some of  
my students, the sense of many young people. 
They're just confronting so many interlocking  
overpowering manifold crises as they inherit 
the 21st century world. How best can we sort of  
combat that sense of almost 
nihilistic apocalyptic despair?
Well I think several ways. One of them actually 
is history. Take a look at what's been achieved  
by the dedicated work of completely unknown 
people. Quote my favourite historian, my old  
friend Howard Zinn, the unknown people who create, 
do the work that creates the basis for the events  
that enter history. We'll never know their names. 
Nobody knows the names of the SNCC workers in 1960  
who travelled through Alabama in freedom buses 
getting shot at, beaten up, vilified, sometimes  
killed in order to encourage black farmers to take 
their lives in their hands and register to vote.  
anybody know their names? I personally happen 
to know a few of them but that's by accident.  
Same with everything else. Feminist movement, 
environmental movement, everything. And a lot  
succeed. Look back, just take the United States. 
Ask what kind of a country it was in the 1960s  
before the wave of activism civilized it. 
1960s, the United States had anti-miscegenation  
laws so extreme that the Nazis refused to 
accept them. It had federally legislated  
segregated housing. There was under the New Deal 
federal support for public housing. But under the  
impact of Southern Democrats, had to be racist. 
You wouldn't be able to get anything through  
unless it was segregated. That had a major 
effect in the 1950s in the growth period.  
An African-American man could maybe get a decent 
job in an auto plant, make a little money,  
maybe buy a small house. Property is wealth in 
the United States. Couldn't buy a small house.  
Government said no sorry they're segregated, 
it's not for you. You don't go there.
There were anti-sodomy laws, of course. Women 
had, by law, women were property literally. The  
US still had the laws that were founded, taken 
over by the founders. British common law under  
which women were property, owned by the father, 
handed over to the husband. It wasn't until 1975  
that the Supreme Court determined that women were 
peers, had a right to serve on federal juries.  
Well we can go on and on. It was a very different 
country before the activism of the 60s. That's why  
in the general intellectual world, the 60s are 
condemned as a time of troubles which disrupted  
the society. It did. It civilized the society 
in many ways. There were things that were wrong.  
There always are. But overwhelmingly it 
basically civilizes society, mainly young people.  
No tradition coming out of almost nowhere. Picked 
up in the 70s. By now, it's all over the place.  
The climate strike a couple of weeks ago. That's 
young people trying to save the world. Well one  
way to support the idea that we should have 
optimism of the will is to look at what's  
been achieved: a lot. Young people today don't 
remember what it was like in the 60s. That's  
ancient history. We can remember, okay. They 
should study it, labor history, the whole story.  
The other major reason, the second major reason 
and that is we do have the answers. There are  
feasible workable answers to every crisis that we 
face. That's important. There's a third reason.  
You have a choice. You can either give up and make 
sure that the worst will happen or you can grasp  
the opportunities that exist. Maybe it'll make 
it a better world. It's not a very hard choice.
Thank you. Okay I've got some questions here  
now from the audience if you 
wouldn't mind to take them.
Here's one from Eric McPherson. He asks, given 
that the masters of mankind will not, what kind of  
organizing by working people can help to bring 
about the kind of international cooperation  
you mentioned? So I guess what he's asking, 
is there a kind of grassroots democratic  
globalization that can be contrasted to those 
that are pursued by the masters of mankind?
Well if you take a look at history, history of 
countries like ours, it's overwhelmingly the case  
that the an active militant labor movement 
was in the forefront of driving progress.  
That's why Canada has a national health 
system for example and the US doesn't.  
The labor unions acted differently 
on the two sides of the border.  
The New Deal measures which brought a measure 
of social democracy to the United States were  
later imitated in Europe to an extent. Labor 
was in the forefront all the way. In England  
post-war world was the labor movement. Reagan 
and Thatcher knew exactly what they were doing  
when they initiated an attack on the labor move. 
No other way to fight a one-sided class war.  
But then there's the opposite side of that 
coin: rebuild the movement. Can be done.  
The United States happens to have 
a very violent labor history.  
It's a business-run society to a remarkable extent 
but there was a vibrant lively labor movement  
in the late 19th-early 20th century. Was crushed 
by force. Primarily the liberals, incidentally.  
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare smashed it. 1920s 
almost gone, the 1930s rose from the ashes,  
started having CIO organizing - this much I can 
remember, it's my family in fact - CIO organizing  
sit down strikes put the fear of god into the 
managing classes, sympathetic administration,  
got some progress. That can happen 
again. Furthermore we should remember,  
it's kind of ancient history, that the labor 
unions are mostly called internationals.  
That can be revived. To some extent, 
it is. You had longshoremen boycotting  
a trade with South Africa under apartheid when the 
US government was strongly supporting apartheid.  
Reagan was the last supporter of the apartheid 
regime but the longshoremen were refusing  
to serve the ships. Okay internationalism for 
the labor movement is needed for survival.  
The neoliberal globalization programs are 
designed specifically to sit poor people, poor  
working people in competition with one another 
so you get a race to the bottom. That's Clinton's  
programs of NAFTA, World Trade Organization 
and so on. The labor movement can fight against  
it. The remnants of the labor movement tried to 
in 1990s. They weren't strong enough to combat it  
but you could have the kind of programs that 
the labor movement put forth. High growth,  
high-wage programs for all participants in all 
countries, labor rights and so on. That would  
be an alternative to the low growth, low 
wage policies of neoliberal globalization.  
Could be done. There were efforts. They 
weren't strong enough to carry it through  
so let's help them become strong enough to 
carry it through. Okay we can do the same  
everywhere else. There are labor problems in the 
universities, plenty of service workers exploited,  
adjuncts, graduate students, lots of 
things that can be done everywhere we are.  
Everywhere we are we can organize, work together, 
build parts of a cooperative society, that's  
where the common good overrules 
personal gain. No, ain't RAND.
Henry Giroux asks, in an age in which education  
far exceeds schooling, how can we talk about 
education as being central to politics?  
How important is culture as a site 
of struggle in the 21st century?
Well the right wing certainly understands this. 
They're fighting culture wars all the time.  
Take the United States. The radical party, the 
Republican party, everywhere it has any role  
in the federal government or the states, 
is pressing very hard for a deeply  
reactionary cultural policy. One of their main 
targets is what's called critical race theory.  
None of them have a clue what critical race theory 
is. If they looked into it, they probably wouldn't  
even understand it. But it's a slogan that was set 
up to mean the great replacement. They're trying  
to destroy the white race, you know. We've got 
to block them from teaching critical race theory,  
block them from teaching the history of the 
vicious oppression of 400 years of repression  
of African- Americans and the bitter legacy it's 
left. Can't teach that stuff. That's critical race  
theory. We got to win the culture wars. Same on 
everything else. No right to abortion, traditional  
Christian conservative culture, in fact let's 
destroy the public schools. Mass public education  
was one of the great contributions of the United 
States to modern society, developed primarily in  
the United States. That was pretty democratic. 
It was important. Same on the university level.  
The great public universities including MIT where 
I was are land-grant universities. They were  
federally set up to provide 
education for the general population.  
There's an ugly side. That meant exterminating 
the native population but okay we'll put that  
in a corner for a moment. You're not supposed 
to teach that either. Fortunately where I am,  
the University of Arizona, they do 
it. Every large talk begins with  
an announcement that we're on the territory 
stolen from the Tohono O'odham Nation which  
is in reservations nearby. It's our responsibility 
not only to acknowledge that but to make up for it  
by educational programs, cultural programs 
which enable them to recover somehow from  
the atrocities we've committed. Okay 
that's at least we could do that. But  
the Republicans and large number of Democrats 
want to kill the public education system.  
For people like Milton Friedman, it was one of 
the highest goals. Get rid of public education. In  
fact, Friedman cooperated with the segregationist 
movements in the 70s. Segregationist movements  
recognized white supremacist movements that 
with federally mandated ending to segregation,  
they could save segregated schooling by putting 
it under some other rubric. Religious education,  
charter schools, you know something or other. 
And Friedman very explicitly cooperated with the  
racist segregationists as part of the effort 
to undermine the public education system.  
The Secretary of Education for Trump, Betsy 
DeVos, comes from a very wealthy family, the  
DeVos Foundation. They are devoted to destroying 
the public education system, replacing it by  
right-wing religious education. It was quite 
open. So defund the schools, defund the state  
colleges and so on. So education is certainly 
a terrain for popular struggle. We shouldn't  
give it away to the right wing. Now the question 
says "in which education far exceeds schooling".  
I think that should be question 
two. What kind of education?  
The kind of education that 
says you don't look at books?  
The kind of education that says you train for 
a test? This was ridiculed in the 18th century  
by the Enlightenment. Ridiculing the worst 
kind of education which they compared with  
pouring water into a vessel and then 
the student poured some of it out.  
We've all had that experience. Taking some course 
that we didn't care about, studying for the exam,  
getting good marks, two weeks later 
forgetting what the course was about.  
That's institutionalized in the United States 
under the first Bush and Obama administrations.  
It's called teaching to test. The worst imaginable 
form of education. Get the students to pass a test  
and then grade the school on the tests so if 
the tests aren't high enough, defund the school,  
reduce the teacher's salary. You 
have teachers, I've talked to them,  
a kid comes up after class and says you brought up 
something interesting, I'd like to pursue it, what  
can I do? The teacher has to say no sorry you have 
to study for that test, to pass the test. This is  
Massachusetts, it's a liberal state. You got to 
pass the test. The teacher doesn't say it but  
in the back of her mind is my salary 
depends on it, school funding depends on it,  
so don't pursue what you're interested in, study 
for the test and then two weeks later forget what  
the course was about. That's teaching to test. 
That's another way to destroy education. One  
thing that's happened strikingly is that literacy 
has sharply declined. There are measures of that.  
I don't know about Canada but in the 
United States there have been studies.  
The kind of novels let's say that used to 
be assigned in eighth grade are now assigned  
to seniors in high school because literacy 
has declined. Reading ability has declined.  
And that's education. Well of course it varies. 
If you're in a rich community. it's fine. Property  
taxes pay for decent schools, maybe have fairly 
decent programs. You know pure pork school funding  
in the United States is based on property taxes. 
Back in the 19th century, that didn't matter so  
much, the populations were mixed. Now it matters 
enormously with radically segregated populations.  
The rich pay higher property taxes. They get 
services, schools, so on. Not in the urban areas.  
So when we talk about education and culture as a 
site of struggle there's a lot to do. Quite a lot.
Maybe our last question should be the one from 
William Patton. Is system change the only solution  
or is transformation of individual behaviour 
also the solution? Or is it one or the other?  
So do we have to start with the system or can 
individuals change themselves essentially?
Why either or? You can do both. You can 
take a look at the major popular movements.  
Take say the Vietnam anti-war movement 
which I happen to be very much involved  
with. We tried to start the movement when John 
F Kennedy, one of the major modern criminals,  
sharply escalated the war in the early 
1960s. Nobody cared. Barely reported.  
But a few of us, there were people around us, said 
look it's time to try to organize some opposition  
to this massive atrocity. We started meeting 
in a living room with a couple of neighbours.  
Maybe you could get to a church where 10 people 
would show up. Long struggle Finally it got big  
changes. That's the way everything works. Take the 
civil rights movement. It really took off in 1960  
when four black students whose name nobody 
remembers sat in a segregated lunch counter  
in North Carolina, Greensboro. Of course, 
immediately arrested, thrown in jail, could  
have been the end. Except the next day a couple 
more black students came, then more, after a while  
you had some students coming down from the north, 
pretty soon you got SNCC and the freedom riders.  
After a while you had mass demonstrations, Martin 
Luther King, you had some institutional changes.  
Nowhere near enough but some and that's the 
way everything works. If we're going to have  
worker participation or control over enterprises, 
first it's a matter of consciousness raising.  
You go back to the women's movement, 
how did it begin in the 60s?  
A group of young kids would get together 
and talk to each other and say look  
we don't have to live like this, we don't have to 
be the servants who serve the coffee, you know,  
we can take part in things. That was a 
big breakthrough. It wasn't easy to do.  
Take the labor movement. You go back to 
when we had a vibrant labor movement,  
late 19th early 20th century. slogan of the 
labor movement mass labor movement was "those  
who work in the mills should own them". The 
idea that you should be subordinate to a master  
was considered an intolerable attack on your 
dignity and rights. We now call that having a job.  
Well that consciousness can be revived. I don't 
think it's much below the surface. It takes work.  
Change of attitudes, change of what 
Gramsci called hegemonic common sense,  
cut it away, change it, along with outcome 
institutional changes. They're mutually  
supportive. You set up a cooperative, gets 
people to think about how you can work together.  
In order to set up the cooperative, you have to 
get people to think yeah we'd like to cooperate.  
So they're mutually reinforcing. I 
don't think it's one or the other.
Thank you and thank you so much for being with 
us tonight. We're greatly honoured to have you  
with us and it's been just a marvelous evening, 
deeply illuminating. I would recommend everyone  
read The Precipice and the many other books that 
Noam Chomsky has brought out. It'll give you  
unrivaled insights into the world in which 
we're living and may I say a sense of hope,  
a tremendous sense of the principle 
of hope that can really inspire us and  
keep us going, so thank you very much Dr. 
Chomsky. Thank you for giving me the opportunity.  
Thank you very much, this is Henry Giroux. 
I just want to say I'm really honoured,  
I'm privileged to have you here tonight. I think 
that every time I hear you, my faith in what it  
means to change consciousness is beginning 
to change enter into politics becomes more  
solidified and more amplified. And I want to thank 
you for your work and thank you for your presence.
