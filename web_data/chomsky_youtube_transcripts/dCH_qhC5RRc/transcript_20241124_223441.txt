without further Ado
questions don't be shy especially
students yes
sir um so I'm going to be traveling to
Lebanon hopefully this Jan uh this
January to do some research but one of
the concerns I have is
in the event of foreign intervention in
Syria do you think that foreign
intervention in Syria is a serious risk
and if so what would be the Fallout from
that it's a serious risk uh turkey one
possibility is turkey May intervene just
to carve out a safe area in the north
because they don't like the idea of
people fleeing into
Turkey um I think Western intervention
is the West doesn't interv on the ground
like the US just kills people from the
air they don't want to take a chance of
anybody shooting at so if there's a
western intervention would probably be
bombing drones things like that there
could be a substantial Fallout it's a
complex area I mean this the dominant
political force in Lebanon is hasbalah
which is closely linked to Syria Syria
is the source of their arms from Iran
and uh they could react to an attack on
Syria in many ways would think they
could disrupt a lot of things in leanon
and they could there could be an effort
to spread the the war across the
border U and you don't know how Syria is
going to react to a big
army a military intervention probably be
the worst thing possible there's um some
of the people really know Syria well and
very critical of the Assad regime have
written about this if you haven't read
it yet you might want to
read Patrick seal who's a kind of the
main historian of Syria has been around
for a long time
sea and uh there's a very good British
journalist who worked a lot in the
Middle East Jonathan steel St l e um
who's also been writing about the
dangers of uh military intervention and
the need to would find some sort of a
negotiated settlement it's a very
complex situation the Country Split and
Military intervention could lead to
there already is a civil war but it
could exacerbate it and make it could
turn it into something like Iraq is like
with you know violent sectarian
Warfare totally out of hand you don't
know where it's going to go and the
region is very inflammable
altogether however I suspect uh you'll
be about as safe in Beirut as you are in
New
York what about news yeah or New
Pools although I hear there terrorists
aiming at the aqueduct
here other questions yes in the back
there please speak up loudly you
sir what is your opinion
on sorry I couldn't hear yeah I'll say
he's asking about the role of music and
literature and affecting change in
global
politics well it certainly had a big
impact
uh it's always
that art forms murals literature music
have always been parts of active social
movements
U certainly been through here through
throughout my lifetime but way back
there's a slightly negative side to it
which was caught once in a you know Tom
L he not your
generation yeah well was a great
saturnist named Tom L
who's he was a song writer he stopped
right he was in the 60s but U you can
pick up his records he uh had
one one song you remember the words in
which he said they win all the battles
but we have all the best songs
that's so there's that aspect but it it
does it always invigorates social
movements it's a mode of
solidity everyone why don't you answer
probably I'll just say something
relative to Howard's in you know because
of today's theme and the reason for us
being here being Howard you know Howard
was some had a real appreciation for the
role of the Arts in social change he was
very interested in theater took part in
theater wrote plays if you ever get a
chance to see any of his plays the
really terrific works but in his own
process of becoming conscious and
politicized and becoming the historian
the people's historian that he became
he really credits a kind of decisive
turning point being listening to the
music of Woody Guthrie and he heard a
song in particular that Woody Guthrie
wrote about a massacre of striking coal
workers in Colorado in 1913 in llo and
he had this moment of realizing that he
was learning about this labor struggle
this strike this repression through a
song by would he gut through but he had
never heard about this struggle in any
any of his courses in history he had
never read about in any of the textbooks
of US history that he was required to
read and it was really a moment when he
began to understand the difference
between the way history is taught in
this country and the actual histories
that had been excluded from the official
history from history from above and
began in becoming interested in history
as a profession for himself and
understanding that you had to tell
history a different way from Below and
that an essential part of that would be
understanding cultural expression song
Music Theater the Arts and so I think
that was one of the remarkable things
about Howard is he's always weaving in
throughout his work references to novels
to poetry to song to literature and it
was certainly something that sustained
him throughout so much of his own work
and life um seeing early plays put on by
the work progress administration in New
York at a time when theater was actually
accessible to workingclass people unlike
today although interestingly last
weekend in New York there was an occupi
Broadway action and people went to
Broadway and did public theater for free
throughout Saturday actually
performances of of great pieces of of
theater and monologues and um uh other
plays were performed to try to reclaim
that public space which has become so
commercial ized so privatized or
Broadway Theater tickets now or $150
$200 tickets do they have participation
from professionals yeah so uh yeah
professional actors um people like
Kathleen shalant who was in the film
Howard's in and I did the people speak
was part of that um and that's another
interesting aspect of occupy actually
the number of musicians who've gone down
and perform Tom Morell performing um
Miley Cyrus remarkably releasing a video
in solidarity with
occupy so it's when that Dynamic starts
happening where the social movements are
informing popular music and popular
music is informing social movements it
can be very
powerful right next question all the way
in the back you
sir I was at the New York OCC New York
City last week and um it turned out that
the New York City General Assembly they
took a decision send a group of 20
people to Cairo to monitor the Egyptian
elections that seemed like a very big
mistake luckily our counterparts on the
Egyptian side they said no thank you we
don't need that we have enough of that
already but there were fears that the
department of govern security had
infiltrated the movement and that's why
they ended up taking a decision like
that now whether they had or not how
could we possibly guard against making
mistakes like
did you hear it yeah I heard it first of
I I don't know what happened in that
case but it could be a perfectly honest
uh uh decision I mean there have
been interconnections between uh tuer
square and the not only the Occupy
movements but also the Wisconsin
movement before it and trying to EST
maybe that's not this isn't the best way
to establish the connections probably
not given what the elections were but
but an effort to try to make those
International connections um uh to raise
them to the level of personal
interchange that's not a bad idea I
think the way to deal with the decisions
that you think are faulty is through the
U General Assembly discussions there's
plenty of opportunities for
interaction there's also a you know
there doesn't really have to be
consensus on these things different
groups can try different
things with that agree that was not the
wisest thing to try because of the
nature of the elections but that may not
have been appreciated by the people who
were making the decision they may have I
don't know who they were but they might
have quite honestly felt that this is a
way to respond to the gestures of
solidarity and support that had come
from the Egyptian
movement yes
ma'am um so bilingual education and
foreign language education is on a very
steady decline in our education system
especially in primary and secondary
schooling and I think a lot of that
comes from a lack of just knowledge of
what Linguistics is so do you think it's
a good idea to introduce the study of
linguistics into maybe a secondary
education or even
primary well I suspect that the attack
on bilingual education is more part of
the general anti-immigrant Hysteria
and uh you know stop taking our country
away from us we don't want to you know
the nativist element that's saying we
want to keep a our old white culture
don't take it away as spreads out to
things like this
um you know whether whether want should
teach Linguistics at the secondary level
is a separate question really I don't
think it'll contribute in one way or
another to the issue of bilingual
education there there are things that
can be done that make some sense in fact
so for example
one one teaching Linguistics at the
school level can get students interested
in uh uh indigenous languages indigenous
cultures uh also the variety of cultures
that exist here which is enormous New
York City a very multi-ethnic society
and that's one way to get into it
another thing that could be done which
actually has been done with some success
is to uh use Linguistics as a way to
introduce students to science like when
you when a eth you know eth grader
studies chemistry it's all kind of
arbitrary so you mix these two things
together and they turn blue and anything
could have happened so this happens and
you memorize that on the other hand you
can uh use data that people know
children know namely their own language
there they have the data it's accessible
to them and a Linguistics program that
introduces kids to Scientific thinking
and rational argument and explanatory
Theory making use of data that they
command where they can in fact invent
new cases you know they can invent their
own experiments because they have the
data they effect
uh that can be a very effective way to
uh introduce just first of all
scientific education but even just
rational thinking there have been some
programs trying that that have worked
pretty well with sixth seventh grade
kids and I think that's something that
could be this one of the few ways in
which you can
introduce uh basically scientific
thinking or just being reasonable about
things figuring out what an argument is
what evidence is how test hypothesis and
so on by making use of data that's
already available the kid doesn't have
to look it up in a book you know they
got in their
head
comian the United States opposition to
it and their insistence that
thees return to the
un State B bid and the US reaction to
it well the
U you have to recognize
that there've been the
ne the way the negotiations are set up
the US uh and Europe unfortunately goes
along uh insists on a particular mode
for dealing with the
problem uh the way this is described
here is that the Palestinians insist on
preconditions and Israel is eager to
proceed without preconditions and the US
wants them all to get around the table
and proceed without
preconditions uh like a lot of
standard Doctrine that's exactly the
truth is exactly the opposite the you if
there were honest negotiations going on
serious ones uh they would be run by
some neutral party some country that has
has some respect in the world like maybe
Brazil or some country like that and
there would be two sides in the
negotiations on the one side would be
the United States and Israel on the
other side would be the rest of the
world because that's in fact exactly
what the conflict has been for 35 years
now the US and Israel insist on strict
preconditions one of them is that the US
must run the
negotiations well that's like saying
Israel must run the negotiations of
course that's not going to get anywhere
uh in fact the at the UN a couple of
times there have been efforts to try to
have a un run negotiation process and
that the last time that came up in the
general assembly I think the vote was
144
to2 144 in favor of it United States and
Israel against it so that's it if the
United States is against something
doesn't happen uh and in fact it's out
of History too you don't even learn
about it uh but uh the negoti that's
what the negotiations would be another
precondition that the US and Israel
insist on is that settlements must
continue in the occupied territories now
there's a lot of talk about expanding
settlements but that's kind of a
triviality the settlements themselves
are
illegal there's no doubt about that
there's no debate about it every
relevant International
Authority World Court the security
Council anyone who matters even the
state of Israel agrees that the
settlements themselves are illegal they
violations of the uh Geneva conventions
which is the core of international
humanitarian law you can't transfer
population into occupied territory but
if you insist that the step settlements
not only stay but continue to expand as
a precondition which is what the US and
Israel do then that again undermines
further the possibility of
negotiations uh furthermore Israel has
already announced pretty clearly that
there are settled areas in the occupied
territories that they intend to anex and
the US backs them up on that so that's
another precondition and under those
conditions of course negotiations are
going to get over and the Palestinian
Authority you I could ask whether the
tactic was right or not but uh they
decided to see if they could break that
Log Jam by going straight to the United
Nations well the US made it very clear
the L they'll never let anything go
through the security Council there the
US has a veto and the US has been
working over time to prevent it uh to
prevent the issue from coming up to the
point where they'll have to cast The
veto because the veto will be very
unpopular throughout most of the world
and the US standing in the world is
already extremely low uh Obama himself
is by now practically a figure of
ridicule uh if uh in the Arab world I
mean he he succeeded he made a real
achievement he succeeded in Def in
surpassing Bush in unpopularity that's
quite a trick I think Bush was 8% he
manag you get to 5% or something like
that so they don't want to cast The veto
so they're trying very hard to pressure
other countries not to vote for it in
the security C
they have to get nine votes to go
through and one veto would stop it and
probably that'll work uh but if it goes
to the general assembly then there'll be
an overwhelming vote in favor of it but
it a general assembly vote has no has no
effect just like the vote that I
mentioned 1442 has no effect uh you
already saw what happened when uh UNESCO
agreed to accept the Palestinians the us
immediately defunded
UNESCO that's 25% of their budget it's
not the first time incidentally uh 1984
the US pulled out of UNESCO allog
together because it had too much of a
third world
orientation and next year it stopped
paying his un dues totally because un
wasn't enough under
control uh but uh Mr Reagan the
U one thing that they're very worried
about both them is that the Palestinians
might be accepted if the Palestinian at
at General Assembly they
can't there's no technical way in which
a general assembly vote could admit
Palestine as a state but they could give
them what's called enhanced Observer
status sort of like the Vatican and that
would enable them to it would be an
opening at least to enter into other un
organizations and one that is very
Troublesome to the US and Israel they
talk about it publicly is that they
might be admitted into the international
criminal court and if they are they can
bring charges against Israel for war
crimes uh the international criminal
court the r the statute on which it's
based does say that a violation of the
Geneva conventions is a war crime and
there's no doubt in anyone's mind that
Israel is in Gross violation the Geneva
conventions is Israel doesn't accept ICC
jurisdiction just like the US doesn't
but it would still be a big propaganda
step so that these are the maneuverings
quite kind of going on in the background
the US is determined to maintain control
of the Diplomatic process which means to
run the negotiations which is a
guarantee that they won't get anywhere
unless US policy changes radically which
could happen of
course okay lots of hands right
now uh could you tell us a little bit
about the day or even the moment when
you really solidified your theory on
universal grammar and like how that
felt it's still not
solidified you know this is science not
religion so every time I graduate
student work walks into your office you
may change your mind you uh but the uh
in fact that's what students are
supposed to be for to
innovate get new ideas so a lot is in
flux but there's some things that are
you know so obvious that
it's it's kind almost embarrassing even
it's it's it's odd that it's a debatable
subject if you think about it because
there's something that's obvious Beyond
discussion uh what's obvious Beyond
discussion is that if a say my a newborn
infant say has a pet uh chimpanzee or
pet kitten or whatever you like Pet song
bird and if they get exactly the same
experience from
birth the infant will instantly
reflexively uh carry out an operation
which no one understands it's sort of
miraculous somehow the infant selects
out of the environment the the
environment is just a massive noise but
the U infant selects out of it uh
information that's relevant to language
now no one knows how that's done none of
the other pets can do any of that like
the chimpanzee has essentially the same
auditory system but it can't do it you
know and then the infant goes on pretty
much reflexively till it's doing what
you and I are doing right now which is
completely impossible for any other
organism well you know either it's a
miracle or there's some genetic element
that uh determines this capacity well
the name for the genetic element is just
Universal
grammar
so the the existence of the of a genetic
component shouldn't really be debated it
is debated but it's just some confusion
you know because there's nothing it's
like questioning whether we have a
genetic element that determines that we
have a Maman visual system or an insect
visual system and it's not the nutrition
in the that goes to the embryo that
determines that it's something in the
gene then the only the question remains
well what is it you know okay that's a
scientific question you can have all
kind of opinions about
it when this became obvious I don't know
probably the first time I started
thinking about language
because it really is
obvious it it what's what's kind of
sociologically or maybe culturally
interesting is that it's considered
debatable it's considered the you know
kind of a strange
hypothesis yes can you talk about your
impression
well I think it's a very exciting
development it's the first major popular
reaction in the United States there have
been some elsewhere to what has been a a
global Onslaught against U the general
population for well over a
generation uh it's a a lot of people are
angry plenty of people are
upset they don't like
it in the United States anger is is
enormous the hatred of Institutions is
enormous like Congress support for
Congress is in single digits the
president not much higher people hate
the banks they hate the scientists they
hate everything uh but this is the first
and they've been you know we don't
people here don't suffer the way you do
in a third world country but you're
suffering by the standards of what ought
to be true in the richest most powerful
country in history and people feel that
but that reacted okay this is the first
reaction it's uh for that reason alone
it's significant and it's been a very uh
a remarkably successful reaction it's
changed even if it were to terminate
tomorrow it's achieved substantial
successes so there are things being
discussed now in the mainstream which
were kind of suppressed obvious things
like say the radical inequality in the
country the slogan
99% 1%
is actually a little wrong it should be
more like
99.9% than 111% because if you look at
the radical inequality in the country
that's grown over the past generation
it's very heavily uh weighted by the top
on/ tenth of 1% of the population which
has gotten just spectacularly wealthy
and with wealth comes political power so
that changes legislation sets off a
vicious cycle and uh people are
certainly suffering from that and uh
there's just an enormous Chasm now
between what the public wants and what
policy makers uh pay do in Washington
and instead of the anger about that just
being unfocused let's Hate Everything uh
this is the first effort and
surprisingly successful one to try to
get people organized to do something
about it uh I think that's it's it's
very exciting and uh it's now spread to
I think about a 100 countries and there
are independent developments in other
countries that have fed into it Spain
Greece Middle East and so on so it's a
worldwide movement not for the you know
not totally from nothing of course but U
on a different scale than anything
that's happened for gener for
Generations so I think that's a really
exciting development there plenty of
promise if people can it's going to face
real
difficulties serious difficulties
already coming and it's going to have to
change I mean it's been a brilliant and
successful tactic but you know tactics
have a kind of a halflife that they
start having diminishing returns after a
while and you have to separate the
tactic from the principle and at some
point you have to turn to other tactics
and I think that time is not far off the
the tactics are going to have to be
things like what Anthony was saying
bringing this to broader communities so
that the 99% can actually participate
and have their own inputs into what
ought to be
done uh and those are that means you
know developing a sustained
dedicated uh popular movements doesn't
have to be a single one popular
movements which will be really willing
to devote themselves to the long-term
arduous effort to
reverse processes that are very harmful
to the country and the world and that
just can't go on much longer without
real
disaster stud at B college senior
project undergraduate thesis on the
Central American solidarity mov of 198
which I know you participated in and
written about do you think they were
successful and do you think there's like
lessons that can be drawn from that
model of like going into TOA or El
Salvador when oppos in like us
intervention there that contemporary
movements could draw on at
all asking about lessons of the80s
Central Central American solidarity
movement yes well they were pretty
important uh they didn't
prevent uh what what happened in Central
America in the 1980s was a complete
disaster a couple hundred thousand
people were murdered there's you
hundreds of thousands of widows orphans
the countries were largely devastated uh
it didn't just begin in the 80s but it
really picked up then in fact a lot of
the immigration now illegal immigration
is still to this day literally to this
day is people fleeing from the wreckage
of the Reagan terrorist Wars in El
Salvador it's not too well known but
around Eastern Massachusetts for example
there's pretty big Mayan Community these
are people fleeing right to the present
from U the Guatemalan Highlands which
where there was virtual genocide in the
1980s against the Mayan community and
similar things elsewhere Honduras is a
special case there that's the one
country where
uh the United States did succeed in
carrying out a military coup military
coups used to be routined but the
capacity to implement them has reduced
but in Obama did manage a military coup
in Honduras I me call at that but there
was a military coup over throughout the
elected president
and Latin America and even Europe was
strongly opposed to it and took measures
against it Obama kind of and Clinton and
kind of you know put out some nice
rhetoric they ended up supporting it and
in fact uh the president elected under
the military regime was just welcomed in
Washington very lavishly and so on
Honduras is an absolute wreck I has the
worst uh homicide rate in maybe in the
world certainly in Latin America uh
there's tremendous repression of
activists uh is very violent and
repressive so uh some the other
countries have changed somewhat
Guatemala is still a horror story but
the so despite all of this the
solidarity mov did have effect could be
a lot worse bad as it was could have
been a lot worse I mean the uh
the the forces that were struggling
against the dictatorships mostly
survived and some of them have even
going forward in the political Arena so
in El Salvador now the government is is
based pretty much on a a political group
that kind of grew out of the gorillas in
the Gaga the still a sundon is the
president and uh not still but again it
was a break uh so so there was some
space for survival and the solidarity
movements shouldn't take credit for that
they were also very valuable here the
these solidarity movements have a kind
of a double function for one thing the
they do help the victims but they also
help civilize the United States you
learn about things you learn about the
rest of the world you learn about your
own country uh it's a impetus to change
things in your country that lead to
actions like that and in many ways
that's I think ends up being the most
positive aspect of the solidarity
movements it's a little bit like the
peace score in that respect uh I don't
know how much the Peace Corp actually
helps people in the countries to which
peace call volunteers go but it's had a
very good effect on the United States
you know this is a really insular
country if people don't know anything
about the outside world
and and you can see why I mean it's you
know you go from say Boston to Los
Angeles 3,000 miles and looks exactly
like where you came from same McDonald's
same language you know same music
whatever a little difference but not
much
most parts of the world say Europe you
go 100 miles or so even different
culture so so it ends up being very
insul also very rich you know it wins
all its Wars and so on but uh getting
some understanding of what the rest of
the world is like and what we do to the
rest of the world that's very
educational and people have worked in a
a village in um Say Ghana or Columbia or
something they do get to seport an
aspect of the world that you wouldn't
know otherwise and they bring it back
and that's been helpful here and I think
that was true of the solidarity
movements they're one of the strains
that feeds into the Occupy movements
that are developing today they come from
a lot of sources but part of it is just
the international
solidarity all right we have time for
one more question and this one is going
to go to you nice and Loud please I was
wondering what your thoughts were on the
bill that Senate recently passed which
declares the United States a
Battleground um and gives the military
basically unchecked power to do whatever
they want to US citizens so I was
wondering what your thoughts were in um
maybe how the citizens could fight back
against it there's a lot of Internet
chatter on that but I'd suggest some
caution I mean it the original bill that
was introduced was pretty bad but there
was a reaction to to it even inside
Washington and it's been cut back the
final bill that was
passed uh or that coming to vote pretty
explicitly says it's not going to change
the law the law is bad enough and the
existing laws horrible and in fact it
pretty much does give uh the government
authority to uh uh keep in fact not
pretty much it does give the authority
to the president to keep people under
preventive intention
indefinitely now it doesn't extend at
the moment to American citizens but
Obama's already made it clear that he
has the right to murder American
citizens that was the uh killing of U
alaki and another American citizen who
happened to be unfortunate enough to be
in the same car with him that's
murdering American citizens because the
president doesn't like them uh that goes
well beyond keeping them under tension
uh but it's true that up until now the
the law doesn't explicitly allow the
president to keep American citizens
under preventive detention preventive
detention remember is a is a very
serious attack on the fundamental
conception of of modern law I mean
anglo-american law is based on the
principle of U presumption of innocence
you're innocent until proven guilty in a
court of law well you know that's been
thrown to the
wind uh for noncitizens uh for people
who are undocumented and it's now
spreading to Citizens but this
particular bill I think doesn't deserve
the
internet concern that was U that had
elicited the concern should be real but
not on this bill rather on the whole
system of uh violation of basic legal
principles
moral and legal principles that's just
spreading before our eyes I mean even
the uh you know even the things that
that don't arouse concern are shocking
like for example there so far been one
trial of the guantan prisoner under
under Obama just take a look at that one
and tell you think what that tells you
about the country you can look it up on
Wikipedia it's a a child named
Omar
khadr it's the first case of a a child
uh submitted to uh
imprisonment law maybe in American
history but certainly for a long time
this is a 15-year-old kid his crime was
the accusation is that uh when American
soldiers invaded his village in
Afghanistan he picked up a gr grenade to
try to defend the village and killed an
American Soldier that's the crime okay
that makes him a
terrorist uh in punishment for that
crime he was sent to First Bagram Air
Base which is worse than Guantanamo then
of Guantanamo he spent eight years in I
don't you know what Guantanamo is like I
tell you he spent eight years in these
prisons you know no lawyer no nothing uh
Co has a 15-year-old child he tried to
defend his Village from the attack by US
soldiers uh after 8 years he was given a
choice by the Obama
Administration very benign the choice
was either plead guilty to the charges
or else get a what amounted to a
permanent life sentence in a you know in
the torture chamber so his lawyer
convinced him to plead guilty to these
terrible charges uh in return for that
he got eight years more in prison now
just take a look at the at the reaction
to that case and think what that tells
you what does that tell you about the
country to be able
to even have a concept of terrorists
like this so if a child tries to defend
his Village from an attack by American
soldiers is a terrorist and therefore we
can send them
the torture chamber for eight for 16
years without a whisper
now he's not a citizen of course but
he's a human
being uh and even in the alaki case the
to the little extent that first of all
there wasn't much of a fuss about it
like if you look at the New York Times
the next day it said the world
celebrates death of Muslim cleric it
wasn't death it was a murder and the
world certainly isn't celebrating it in
fact most of the world is horrified but
what they mean is is uh privileged
Americans in the New York Times
editorial board they think it's great
you know uh but to the extent that there
was any criticism of it there was some
it was mostly because he was an American
citizen and maybe we shouldn't murder
American citizens you know maybe we
should just murder other people uh but
uh I think all of that is way more
important than the this particular bill
which was paired down so that it's worst
