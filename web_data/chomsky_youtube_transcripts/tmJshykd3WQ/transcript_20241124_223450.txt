greetings I'm Ken hild debrand
your and we're here with Professor Nom
Chomsky the most quoted living author
and this is really about all of us
humans who live here on planet Earth at
the height of the information age and
the media are hiding things from all of
us this includes you every bit as much
whether you consider yourself
conservative or liberal or right left
whatever what we're going to talk about
today concerns you I mean how come if
gnome's the most quoted living author
how come with all these political shows
we have on TV is he not on I think we
can break the media's back I want you to
look at this from well we'll start off
with a galactic perspective I mean here
we are in a spiral galaxy known as The
Milky Way that takes over a 100,000
years for light to travel from one end
of it to the other now like travels at
over 86,000 m per second that's over
seven laps around the earth per second
and yet it takes 100,000 years to get
across and so here we are out here on
one of these spiral arms on this
rock and we're alling this together at
the height of the information age and
the media are hiding things from us and
it's just astonishing it it's uh it's
also depressing but it could be turned
around if we all get involved so I guess
I'm going to open that up uh to you know
and say that you know what do you think
I mean so many people turn to you and
others and they think well you know I
hope you have success or good luck to
you um and I think what we need to do is
really get more people
involved uh so what do you think about
that well there certainly are uh major
problems that uh people ought to be
involved in uh in in fact we're kind of
like uh if any of the people listening
feel that maybe we're you're in a group
of lemmings being led across a cliff uh
to fall down you're not wrong we're
being led across a cliff and we might
fall down to some I wouldn't say species
destruction but to destruction of the
possibility of a a decent human life and
anything like the form we uh H have to
the extent we have it and or anticipate
and there are two major
crisis uh looming dark clouds hanging
over everything one of them is nuclear
war and it's kind of a miracle that uh
the species has survived without severe
damage since
1945 there have been case after case
where the threat of nuclear war came
ominously close
sometimes under conscious control often
just by accident and sooner or later
that's not you can't engage in a a
highrisk Enterprise for a long time
without the risk coming to pass uh we
have case after case we just had a
recent case in fact which is even more
ominous because there was no discussion
of it uh when
and this is a minor example but it's
happening all the time but it's it's
nevertheless kind of vivid so when uh
President Obama sent uh uh an
assassination team to assassinate uh
Osama Bin Laden it's by now pretty clear
it was a planned assassination could
have apprehended him brought him to some
kind of court or whatever uh they were
under orders to fight their way out if
necessary if they had tried to fight
their way out meaning confronting the
Pakistani army uh they would almost
certainly have had air support probably
ground support uh could have ended up
with a major confrontation with the
Pakistani army that's a a major well
organized Army uh and as every
specialist on Pakistani army can tell
you and in fact right uh they're a
disciplined Army dedicated to the uh
South defending the sovereignty of
Pakistan and if called upon they will
fight uh furthermore the one of the
legacies of Ronald Reagan is that uh and
his successors but primarily him the
Pakistan is a one of the maybe the most
rapidly growing uh nuclear weapon state
in the world and also the Jihadi
elements are nowhere near a majority of
the population nevertheless the society
is is kind of interlaced with them
there's overwhelming opposition to the
United States and Pakistan for
understandable reasons that pakistanis
deeply resent the way in which they're
being treated they're being bombed
invaded uh pressured to uh enter into
what they see as an American war in
Afghanistan to defeat an indigenous
Insurgency pakistanis don't particularly
like the Afghan and Taliban but they
treat them the way they did the Afghan
mujahadin who were fighting the Russians
they didn't like them either but they
thought they had a right to uh defend
their country from foreign attack so
they're being drawn into uh an American
War which they don't like and they're
suffering from it uh overwhel antagonism
has increased enormously with the Obama
drone attacks and uh the intrusions into
Pakistani territory the pressures on the
Pakistani army to go into tribal areas
well in any event this assassination
plan if it hadn't gone smoothly
Commandos would have had to fight their
way out enter into a confrontation with
the Pakistani army society and the
nuclear facilities are not only laced
with people who are strongly opposed to
the United States policies that's
throughout the society but also with
jihadis it was opening the up the
likelihood that uh uh fisa materials
would leak into Jihadi hands which means
maybe a dirty bomb going off in New York
and London or something like that and
his whole thing as far as um as far as
that operation here they had a chance to
question the leader yeah of Al Qaeda now
that it seems kind of suspicious to me
that they wouldn't want to have some of
that
material uh or some of that information
yeah you're right I mean uh they would
have apprehended him they could have
brought him to try in a decent Society
you'd bring them to trial like we did
with Nazi war criminals right who were
much worse than some comparably worse
than Bin Laden but they were brought to
trial the nberg trials and a lot came
out that was uh educational in fact it
helped establish the basis for modern
international law but not in this case
they wanted him killed
and no aoxy and why well you you got to
speculate about that yeah you have to
speculate I mean fact is that he was
murdered when he easily could have been
apprehended he was defenseless unarmed
and nobody with him but his wife and and
his daughter was in the house too wasn't
she pardon his daughter I think was in
the house too I don't know I I know his
wife was with him oh okay and these 79
command original reports yeah the
original reports were all withdrawn they
were completely they recognized must be
falsified it was a simply an
assassination the the White House claim
was the wife his wife was shot and uh it
was claimed that she the commanders had
to defend themselves she lunged at right
yeah I've heard that story that's you
want to buy that story okay but anyway
he was unarmed he was defenseless they
could have brought him out instead they
murdered him uh they dumped his body at
sea without an autopsy so you don't know
how he was killed right and yes that
does raise all kind of questions he was
a suspect remember right he was a
suspect at first he denied any
involvement it doesn't matter even if it
doesn't matter what he said unless a
person is in at least in what used to be
our system of justice until a person is
convicted he's a suspect right it
doesn't matter if you're certain he's
guilty so Timothy McVey was a suspect
you know exactly Charles Manson was a
suspect suspect yeah that's what it
means in law so they murdered a suspect
and dumped his body in the ocean without
an autopsy which is in violation of
first of all Pakistani law but also
international human rights law well
that's what happened but
the there was a threat of nuclear war
actually there are other interesting
aspects to this assassination attempt
which should make us think Al outside
the United States people not only think
but are very angry about
people in the US just don't care it
seems to me in fact they're both
so-called sides which we discussed about
last time discussed last time uh the the
the liberal media and and the
conservative media they were all part
this
was thing but but not not outside not
outside the country exctly across the
border in Mexico in Mexico there was
Fury about they didn't like the
operation but about the name of the
operation the name of the operation
Operation gono gono was a a hero who was
defending his people from uh uh what
amounted to
extermination was taking place in
Mexican Mexican territory that we
conquered so the idea that we would call
this operation Operation gono just
amazed people in Mexico and infuriated
them and there was plenty of anger
elsewhere as well but my point was that
it did
take carry the understood perfectly
understood risk of a potential nuclear
disaster but it was done anyway and that
goes on all the time so that's one
pending catastrophe the other one is
environmental but that's getting worse
the
international uh energy Association just
which monitors greenhouse gas emissions
and so on they just uh published a
report a couple weeks ago which reported
that uh greenhouse gas emissions last
year uh hit a record despite the
recession which cut back usage and
furthermore they warned that the world
may be reaching or may have passed the
uh what has been taken by the scientific
consensus as a a kind of a watershed
after which we're in real trouble that's
a right probability of a 2%
two the the deniers I'm sorry but the
deniers of the global warming claim now
there were some falsified papers or
something that East Anga emails you know
that was all dismissed it was
investigated there was nothing to it but
you know some people wrote emails they
shouldn't have written okay big has no
effect on anything well one the thing
that one of the things that gets to me
too is the whole I mean we've got
environmental issues and and then again
we have nuclear power nuclear war and
nuclear power with these plants are
popping up all over the place and um
alternative fuels and I you haven't had
the chance to look as much into hemp as
I have but there are uh I mean hemp was
called a billion doll crop back in in
1938 February issue of Popular Mechanics
I brought the issue up to Ralph nater he
said he called it a multi-billion dollar
crop I mean here how on whether it could
supply all of our energy needs or even
just some of them the fact that we're
making illegal something that would help
our our country not only
ecological ecologically but also um the
economy I mean the economy needs a shot
in the arm right now and hemp would
certainly at
least give it something and and some
argue quite a bit so I don't know that
you know it's like these both sides are
just are keeping this stuff from us and
um I remember seeing an exer Movie
Network that was put out in 1976 with
this guy this and the Anor was ready to
he was he was going to he was going to
die in a short time or something like
that and he he just started really
telling it like it is saying you know
we're in a lot of trouble you know
because you people and 65 million others
just like you are watching me right now
you know and then less than I forget the
percentage of you read books and this
and that and that you know you've talked
in the past that people have the
capacity to see through the deceit in
which they're snared and I just hope
that that we get uh both right and left
people to realize that we're all being
scammed by this censoring media who
aren't giving us all the facts well I I
as you mentioned I don't really know
enough about hemp to comment on it so
I've read what you sent me and
interesting things but haven't
researched it and can't make a judge
judgement but there are certainly very
clear things that uh could be done we we
are in an economic crisis the crisis of
joblessness primarily that's the crisis
there's not enough jobs that means not
enough demand that means not enough
production so you end up with a deficit
and so on so there is a crisis we should
be uh increasing demand so that people
could go back to work uh there's one way
to increase Demand only uh consumers
aren't going to do it cuz they're in
trouble uh partly because of the
joblessness a business has the
corporations are loaded with cash but
they're not investing uh because either
because they're interested more in
financial manipulations or overseas
production or or simply because there's
no domestic demand anyway they're not
doing it that leaves government that's
the one source of demand and if you want
to get out of this crisis that's what
ought to be done there ought to be
massive programs kind of like WPA in the
1930s there's plenty of things that have
to be done in the society I mean the
infrastructure is collapsing uh you come
back from Europe to here as I did
recently you feel you're coming to a
third world country you know nothing's
working you know and there plenty of
work to be done plenty of hands ready to
do it can't get them together that's a
you know an indictment of the economic
political economy which is just shocking
and it's also known how to do it through
government stimulation well there's been
so much corporate run propaganda against
government against government of course
corporations they don't want to get rid
of government because they rely on it we
don't have a market system so they rely
on it but they don't want it to
interfere with their rights so therefore
what they'd like is more corporate
control of the society that means
reducing the government role keep it
there for the military to bail them out
when they get in trouble and so on and
so forth but not for meeting human needs
uh and that propaganda has in fact
successfully convinced people that the
government can't do things and they can
I me like take say What's called the
Obama stimulus the standard belief is it
didn't do anything actually it saved
millions of jobs uh in fact there was no
stim it was much too small in fact if
you estimate it there was no stimulus at
all the federal government stimulus just
about compensated for for the decline in
spending at the state and local
government levels so effectively flat no
stimulus you get that from the you know
National Economic analysis it was too
small but it did something saved a
couple million jobs if you had a
significant one it would do a lot that's
one way of turning to a growth economy
which could overcome the major crisis
joblessness and incidentally would mean
more more revenue and hence cut at the
deficit but there's another issue about
the deficit there are ways even if you
put this aside there are ways to deal
with it and what's more the public is
pretty much aware of that so for example
one way to deal to cut the deficit which
is has enormous public overwhelming
public support is tax the super rich
exactly well they they keep say but
that's not on the agenda well fairly
either now there are some people I think
even in the house or bringing that up
there are a few people around the
fringes that percentage a couple others
yeah but they're not and they're not put
out there no the main Obama and the
mainstream Democrats given it up um of
course the Republicans won't talk so
what's going to happen that's one thing
but there's a lot more what about
military spending exactly has been
touched barely touched but you know our
military spending is approximately the
same as the rest of the world combined
it's not for defense it's not for
security uh when you look at public
there are some studies of what the
public would like to do to cut back the
deficit one aspect correctly is cut back
military spending hundreds of bases
abroad and so on not touched uh there's
a third thing which is not barely
discussed at all and it's the most
important of all of them and that's the
dysfunctional Health Care System we have
a it's an international scan
has about twice the per capita costs of
comparable countries some of the worst
outcomes it's the only privatized
virtually unregulated system and that's
why if Medicare say was extended to the
whole population sort of like other
countries the the chances are there'd be
no deficit there' probably be a surplus
actually the details of this have been
worked out by a very good Economist Dean
Baker at the center for econom EIC and
policy research you can read it a big
shot we need but that's that's that's
not even on the agenda and the reason is
well that's what the people I think need
to that's only part of it yeah I mean
the the United drug prices in the United
States are Way Beyond comparable
countries reason straightforward it's
the only country where uh the government
is banned by law from uh negotiating
drug prices with pharmaceutical
companies of course it's out of sight uh
the population is overwhelmingly opposed
to this uh these things are not even
being discussed uh and that's simple
reason for it it's because of the
enormous power of the financial
institutions and the pharmaceutical
corporations the financial institutions
that the right before the crisis hit
hard 2007 now they were actually getting
40% of corporate profits now their
activities it's very doubtful that their
activities uh have a positive effect on
the economic system they may in fact be
harmful I mean there's a role for banks
and back in the say the 50s and 60s when
so-called golden age of modern
capitalism Banks were Banks they would
take a a bank would take say your bank
account you're not using that capital
and uh transfer it to somebody for using
it for some productive purpose maybe
start a small business or send their kid
to college or buy a house or whatever it
may be that's what banks are supposed to
do in a capitalist system it was pretty
much what they were doing up until 1970
early' 70s they were in right at that
point there's a huge change in the
General Financial system there move
towards financialization of the economy
and offshoring of production and that's
had huge effects one effect is that
massive concentration of wealth in a
tiny percentage of the population
actually a fraction of 1% that fraction
of 1% that that's the top 1% needs to be
dived you know economic power translates
into political power so you get policies
which exaggerate this and it's a vicious
cycle it's been going on particularly
since Reagan combined with deregulation
with massive funding of Elections with
the breakdown of the political parties
so both parties now Democrats and
Republicans have pretty much given up
the traditional system for
assigning uh committee chairs in in in
in Congress that's a position of
authority and power used to be seniority
now if you want a committee chair you
got to pay the party a huge sum of money
which means that not only the election's
being bought and with citizens united
it's probably going to go out of sight
but it means that every person in
Congress if they want any position of
authority you're going to have to pay
off the party uh pay off the party means
you know run to the corporations so this
is a this really is a vicious cycle it's
just and the population is kind of aware
of it so you know appr think they're
aware of the well they're not aware of
the details but approval rate for
Congress has declined to Historic lo oh
they can't stand them but yet when it it
comes time uh election time as you know
most of my research has been involved uh
with elections since
2000 and uh at many times the Democrats
hog the corporate money and it was just
uh and
unfortunately back in 2000 uh the whole
concept of a spoiler uh really took root
and it means anybody challenging the
system when really to me the the media
or the spoilers they're the one who are
are keeping this can out I mean if you
looked at at Ralph nater compared to Al
Gore uh who was vice president when the
prison population in the United States
doubled uh and he's against this other
guy
who scarcely could speak the English
language um yet you know here you had
somebody who was responsible for seat
belts and airbags and I mean you know
like them or not as far as what he had
done uh I think it would have been like
when you uh uh debated that a former
Dutch Minister of Defense FR
Boris you I mean he ended up just
looking at his watch and excusing
himself and walking off the stage I mean
they don't want to have people in there
who are talking about uh um well for
instance uh I think it's North Dakota or
South Dakota has their own banking
system and they're the only ones that
want in the red I found this out through
interviewing a a governor candidate for
uh California and she was just you know
eliminated and arrested uh for wanting
to you know for trying to just even sit
in the audience and watch a debate that
you should have been a part of I mean I
think that if people at the election
level this is where they're really
getting shafted the most I don't know
what it would take it doesn't seem like
nater wants to run again if he did I
wish he'd pick uh a running mate who who
was well known too it has to be more
than a running mate if if you want to
play the game in the political system
maybe you don't want to do that but if
you if you do want to do it you have to
do it the right way it supposed by some
miracle say nater could be elected
president he couldn't do a thing he
doesn't have a single representative in
Congress not a single not a single
Senator not a single house
representative not a single Governor not
a single local school board I mean you
know the whole system it takes the
people to back them that's why I'm
saying if the people start screaming
can't participate in the system unless
if if you want to participate in this
system you going to have to become a
political party a political party means
Representatives at every level it means
Grassroots organizing it means
participation that means proposing
programs you just can't say look I'm the
candidate here's my program if it's
going to be a serious I mean yeah that's
I thought about starting a political
party is that what you're talking about
I mean you know I'm put that
qualification and if you want to play
the game in this system may you want
some system should be a different system
in fact I think there should but in this
system that's what we're talking
about You' got to do something like the
greens but within the confines of this
system we could actually overcome if we
if we had enough effort we could it
would take it's not it's or organization
organ education uh everything we're
talking about would have to be on the in
the public agenda it's not going to come
from uh you know the corporate system
it's not going to come from the
corporate media but you but it's going
well you know it's just it's choices
more than sensory like take for example
what I just said about the uh buying of
Committee of committee chair positions
that's very important now you can read
that in the media in fact yesterday
there was a very good article about it
by a fine political Economist best one
in the country in my view Tom Ferguson
but the article was in the London
Financial Times isn't that amazing
that's we can find out what's happening
in London now that's the that's the
difference I mean when I first saw
manufacturing consent know chsky in the
media saw that you you were talking
about how LLY these issues were brought
up I mean just a few minutes ago you're
talking about in Mexico but yet people
aren't even with the internet we ought
to be able to find out what they're
saying in Mexico and Canada and uh the
internet is a great thing and I use it
all at time but you know it's not a it's
not really a substitute for uh a
political organization I mean using the
internet to learn things is like some
you know uned some person who's never
had a science course uh walking into the
Harvard biology library and saying okay
I want to be a biologist yeah all the
information is there right but you're
kind of you don't know what to look for
you don't know what makes sense what
doesn't make sense you can pick a piece
out and say okay that's important and go
off on some crazy tangent uh uh it's
it's not doesn't work you can use the
internet or any source of information if
you come to it with a framework of
understanding you know what to look for
you know what makes sense what doesn't
make sense what to build on now you know
these it's these are not axum like if
you're sensible you're willing to
question your prior assumptions but you
got to have some framework of
assumptions you get nowhere so they
could look up as far as U um the
distribution of wealth you look it up
but
why is it there know I well you're going
to have to look through a wide variety
take it's not enough to look through a
wide variety you have to know what
you're looking for like the guy who wins
the Nobel Prize in biology is not the
person who read the most journals it's
the person who knew what to look for
that's what it takes to that's what it t
and that's what education and
organization are about like uh te a
unions the the enormous attack against
unions and business hates them you know
business dominated government hates them
they practically destroyed part of the
reason is just they defend workers
rights and of course business doesn't
like that but another reason is they're
a democratizing force they're a way for
people you know working people to get
together to exchange ideas to interact
uh to learn from each other to sharpen
their own thinking to formulate policies
at their best I mean they don't always
work like this but at their best that's
what they do and that's why you know
with all their flaws the uh historically
the unions have been at the Forefront of
just about every Progressive cause uh I
can remember say from the 1930s when I
was a kid my family is mostly unemployed
working class but what sort of gave them
hope and it was a much more hopeful
period than today was uh the fact that
they were involved in Union organizing
and the unions provided something so
like for my uh seamstress aunts
unemployed uh ilu you know the latest
garment Workers Union provided
educational opportunities uh weaken the
country uh social social contacts
educational
programs uh uh opportunities to interact
with others and work to try
to get well think I mean obviously we
need to help save unions too but that's
what we need to do is kind of uh try to
take it after what they're doing I mean
as far as I think on a community level
people just need to start interacting
and say okay well let's look at a some
of the things that you and I have have
uh um tried to put out there time and
time again you know talking about the
illegality of cannabis we don't need
that kind of waste right now that's just
such a waste of of resources not to
mention it makes our society more
dangerous I mean if you're looking
for I mean if they can focus on a few I
mean that's to me such a simple concept
and even people like Sarah Palin have
said and and Pat Robertson have said
yeah probably should be decriminalized I
mean when well let's face it they
forgave Obama for doing cocaine if he
had said he he you know robbed the
convenience store they wouldn't have
forgiven one's a crime one isn't it's
really that simple I think and the
president of Colombia has recently
called for decriminalization of
marijuana yeah I think it's a big part
of uh of what's going on and also
there's other things like you've talked
about I'm trying to get it throw a lot
at them that they can really uh in a
short amount of time but you you've
talked about this time and again about
how peace we could have peace in the
Middle East that there's a reason why
they don't show these maps of what how
they want to have their two-state
settlement and that the rest of the
world is in agreement as to what we
could do then we could get at the source
of the Grievances as far as what you
know why we're in Afghanistan why we're
all why we're hated throughout the world
I mean a lot of this has to do with the
the US and Israel and and
uh in fact that's a big bone of
contention the US is quite isolated on
that and has been for a long time I it
got worse last February when uh Obama
reached the point where Obama EO to
Security Council resolution that
basically called for implementation of
official US policy and of course it was
alone in doing so it's going to come up
again in a couple of weeks if the
Palestinians go through with their uh
plan announced plan to call for some
sort of recognition of Palestinian
statehood they're going to get a lot of
support they already are recognized by
well over 100 countries uh probably
majority of the population of the world
big Latin American countries Brazil
Argentina others and uh Europe is kind
of vacillating it's the US would
certainly veto it at the security
Council but they can't veto it at the
general assembly I mean the press canot
report it which often happens with
General Assembly resolutions but uh it's
going to be more us isolation pretty
much against the world uh what about
Obama he actually called for I think it
was the pr67 bers wasn't it no or post
67 but that people made a big fuss about
that but that's traditional American
policy the traditional American policy
goes back to ' 67 is that a settlement
has to be on the 67 borders and the
early wording was the pre-war pre-war
borders pre pre the internationally
recognized borders uh with maybe minor
and mutual modifications that was
official US policy from ' 67 to the
early' 70s when the US was still part of
the world on this issue and that's
essentially the global position is
almost unanimous uh now a lot of
Christians notice what Obama said he
said yeah he repeated that but he added
something else uh right away uh at his
talk to APAC right right after that he
said we have to recognize the changes in
demographic realities
well that's code Words which everyone
understands it means the Israeli
settlements we have to recognize the
Israeli settlements yeah that's true but
if you do that and you take a look at
the map of the settlements actually can
show it to you that
essentially leaves nothing it leaves
very little it leaves isolated cantons
uh all separated from one another
separate from one another pretty much
with the so of course the world isn't
going to go along with that nobody will
uh the uh uh and uh this this is
actually been going on for 35 years but
it's getting more extreme because of the
more extreme uh the growing support for
a diplomatic resolution of the conflict
and it's understood what it ought to be
and the same's true on other issues like
what's considered say the major issue I
don't think it's the major issue but
what's talked about as the major threat
to World Order is Iran potential Iranian
nuclear weap weapons that's ridiculous
okay you can think about it what you
like but there is a solution and it's a
solution which is overwhelmingly
supported the solution is a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
combined with extensive verification
they would never go for that they don't
even admit they have look that the
support for that is so strong including
the American population that at the
there there are regular review sessions
of the nuclear proliferation treaty the
last one was last may you may a year ago
support was so strong that Obama had to
go along with it Clinton Hillary Clinton
actually was there the representative
but they Obama and Clinton said yeah
it's fine idea but not now and
furthermore any solu any such
Arrangement must exclude Israeli nuclear
weapons of course and furthermore uh
they went beyond they said Israeli
nuclear weapon weapons cannot be placed
under the supervision of the
international economic uh atomic energy
agency and furthermore information about
nucle Israeli nuclear weapons and
information about the countries that are
supporting them cannot be addressed that
was the US qualification to the call for
a nuclear weapons free zone well of
course that kills it that kills but that
would be a significant not not a
solution to everything but a significant
step towards mitigating whatever crisis
there might be and of course the world
knows this the uh it's not to I don't
think it's even reported here but sure
that's uh let again go back to the
original Point another way in which the
threat of nuclear war is being
enhanced and uh well you know I think a
lot of the block here is that the uh the
Christian right is like well we want
Israel to exist but
Israel Israel would exist right Israel
would still exist so it's nobody wants
the destruction of Israel in fact this
would be improve their security a
political settlement would improve their
security but states don't set security
as a high priority I mean Israel has a
had a choice for the last almost 40
years between security and expansion and
they've systematically preferred
expansion wow undermining security which
is not unusual that's the way States
behave
uh and the US has backed them which is
why they're doing it so it would improve
their security uh but that's not the
issue but the Christian right has
something else in mind they want it's a
huge block of Voters and they're
passionate about it they're not informed
about a lot of I think they are informed
well not about that the that the
settlement could be well could be
reached I I think they may even know
that but they've got something else in
mind yeah they are looking forward to
Armageddon exactly because if you want
to have system and then so there's a
whole belief system actually probably
George Bush number two probably believed
in this uh if you have Armageddon then
the souls that are saved rise to Heaven
all sort you know Jesus Christ comes for
a thousand years at peace in a whole
story so fine let's uh they are the most
the these pro-israel Christian right are
the most anti-Semitic people in the
world I mean they want all the Jews to e
to be exterminated or except for 144,000
who were somehow converted 12 * 12 but
uh uh you know something like
that but uh uh and uh and they're a big
important voting block and a pressure
group and incidentally Christian Zionism
goes back way before Jewish Zionism and
has always been very powerful in the
more fundamentalist countries Britain
and essentially the United States so
it's that and there's other interests
there's plenty of other interests uh
which is preventing uh moving forward on
this issue exactly and it's it's harming
Israel it's isolating the United States
you know I think of the if we try to go
for peace how can that I mean if they're
supposedly followers of the prince of
peace shouldn't that be the the way to
go maybe they're AR if if they think
that that's true maybe it's not for
another 10,000 years you know but why
should they make it happened
well this is not the whole Christian
Evangelical movement I'm talking about
it's one segment of it the revivalist
segment but if you look at this movement
the end times movement it actually took
off with the founding of Israel 1948 is
when it took off and that was takey re
James HJ these guys that's when uh or
this you know these best sellers in
times which millions and millions of
people reading believe 1948 was supposed
to be the beginning of the end of times
right 1967 was another step towards
where I think about a third of the
population in the United States expect
the second coming in their lifetime if
they only knew what was going on to this
Palestinians stuff they don't care the
pales if they saw the pictures I mean
they being deprived of water kids being
shot uh I
mean tell they went go back to operation
gono remember this
country has completely suppressed not
totally but largely suppressed the what
was done to the indigenous population
sure now the people who were doing it
understood it very well yeah so you read
say John Quincy Adams you
know the great strategist who the father
of manifest destiny I mean he said uh
you know he
described what he called the fate of
that something like that hapless race of
Native Americans who we are
Exterminating with such pery and
cruelties that it's a a heinous sin for
which God will someday bring us to
account they knew what they were doing
but it's so suppressed that you can name
an operation Operation
gono after one of the people trying to
something that you had brought up that
some that we' made some Headway on but
then look how far you have to go the uh
and I think that relates to Israel a lot
of the
population regards what Israel is doing
as pretty similar to what we were doing
I mean we drove away the indigenous
population you know kind of exterminated
them it's obviously the right thing to
do cuz we did it and Israel's kind of re
revive renewing that I'd like to wrap
the sub rning at a time I'm being tall
but um just the whole
separation whether it's indigenous
population here and and and um and those
who took over or it's it's the Israelis
and and everybody else or it's even uh
you know the the blacks and the whites
we all have a common ancestor Out of
Africa very far back 50,000 years ago
right it's not a long time in
evolutionary history we're all as Jimmy
Henrik said we're all families apart in
his long machine what's more if you
actually bothered looking at people's
jeans uh it's everybody almost everybody
is completely mixed right wow Henry
Lewis Gates head of the afro american
study program at Harvard did a big study
on this and he discovered that he
himself is 50% European wow and
50% African but you almost everybody's
kind of mixed in all so we're all
families
apart well with that known thanks again
huh always always great
