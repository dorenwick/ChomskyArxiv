well it's been uh exciting exhilarating
in fact to see the occupied Boston
program develop and uh uh spread and
from what I can see to see the
directions it's been moving uh there's
no question that the country desperately
needs something like this not just uh
protest against the pretty uh awful
things that are happening but uh some
ideas and proposals and suggestive
constructive um proposals about how to
organize to achieve a very different
kind of world and there's not a lot of
time to do it so the the fact that this
is beginning to happen here you know
Wall Street couple other places has a
lot of uh potential
and
significance could turn the country
around so it's real exciting to watch
I'll try to come if I can manage somehow
but you know what my schedule is like
it's hard to find five minutes to make a
telephone call but I will try to work it
in somehow
