I would like to link our first topic of
Ukraine with my own little country
Belgium you have already mentioned you I
mentioned just now also that the federal
system of Belgium people continue might
be something to consider as a possible
future supplement for Ukraine now there
are some similar similarities we know we
are two linguistic communities one
Speaking the same language as in France
and our neighbor to the South and
another part where I live speaking Dutch
the same language as in our neighbor in
the Netherlands
but we should not I always say we should
not overstate it Belgium is a small
country 11 million people one of the six
founding members of the European
economic Community you know the
predecessor of the EU also I do not want
to idealize it our federal system it has
its shortcomings I mean it's complex and
at times slows down decision making I
was as was proven during the pandemic it
does however have one essential quality
never a shot has been fired over the
bi-national issue
but different as the two different
Belgium and Ukraine are it certainly has
some features that might be applicable
now I don't know how familiar you are
with the federal system here but do you
believe that institutional change on a
federal model could be the solution for
Ukraine because personally I believe
that might be part of it but I also
believe that the real underlying
solution lies deeper in socio-economic
development for all ukrainians what do
you think about this
absolutely but it's not on the agenda we
have to live with the world as it is not
as we'd like it to be we can try to
improve it but right now we have an
imminent problem the choices for Ukraine
are either permanent war and destruction
with everything else for the world or of
some kind of federal arrangement
it's by far it's far from ideal
it's far from ideal in Belgium I can I
can tell you some personal anecdotes
just did
a couple of years ago it was lecturing
in the Dutch era and
the guy who organized the lectures and
linguist friend of mine and my my wife
former wife she's died at the time and
his wife were out shopping somewhere
during the morning lectures we were
going to meet for lunch
so he went to the desk of the universe
at the University and asked the
secretary there to call a taxi and we
waited no taxi came waited no tax again
finally we came back to her he came back
and asked her what's the problem she was
desperate
she said she's only allowed to talk
Dutch Flemish and the taxi drivers are
all French they pretend not to
understand of course they all understand
but they pretend not to understand so
there's no way for her to call a taxi
okay that's a nuisance but it's better
than killing each other you know so
for Ukraine
that's the optimal situation at the
moment but I don't know if it can be
achieved but it's the best that you can
imagine
ultimately they're much better Solutions
yes absolutely just just as a side
remark uh for Anglo-Saxon people I would
like to remark that there's no such
thing as a Flemish language I know that
it's an idea that exists we do speak
much we do speak Dutch we might have an
accent you know like you could call us
the Australian version of uh Dutch but
our final subject is the thing that I
mentioned in the beginning
now uh our mutual friendly Apple II and
Belgium manage home economy now uh
coincidence has it that three hours ago
our King Philip addressed the Congolese
parliament in Kinshasa what is called a
very historical moment in the mainstream
media what he did is he expressed his
deepest regrets for the wounds of
colonization but he offered no apologies
and no words about what Belgium did
after independence in 1960 because
Belgium did much more than just colonize
the government and banking both one at
the time were involved in the
assassination of Patrice lumumba that
supported the secession of the katanga
province going against the U.N by the
way and supported the brutal
dictatorship of mobuti for 30 years
I can tell you that the colonial
archives here in Brussels are still
unaccessible to the public today
now Civil Society luckily is waking up
to the importance of decolonization and
in fact black lives matters enjoys Floyd
raised a much broader Awareness on the
issue for example on the statues of King
Leopold his street names his plazas in
Brussels and Europe or stand and other
places
at the moment as an ongoing debate
between those who say take these statues
down and others who say no let them be
they're part of our history put a plaque
or whatever you call it as something
that gives context Duty statues now I
have two questions for that and we will
wrap up then after that first of all
where do you stand on this issue and
secondly is this just a matter of
symbolics or is there more to it
well there's a similar situation in the
United States with
statues and names of buildings after uh
Confederate generals
other races extreme racists and like
Woodrow Wilson my opinion is with the
those who want to leave the statues I
would say leave the statues with a
plaque
or maybe another statue illustrating
what actually happened
uh I think that's the right idea that's
it let's not erase the history let's
expose the history so people understand
it and as you said it's not ancient
history what Belgium did in 1960 is one
of the worst Crimes of the century
Africa was beginning to decolonize the
most important country in Africa is
Congo Congo rich country could be one of
the richest countries in the world
enormous resources and tremendous
potential it had a charismatic leader
young leader very smart guy Patricia
lumumba could have led the country
forward to develop to become a major
power could have led all of Africa
behind it well the CIA had a contract to
kill him with bills and intelligence got
there first and they killed him then
they said along with the United States
supported this first of all the
contender then this vicious kleptomaniac
mohudu who destroyed the country
by now millions of people millions are
dying in eastern Congo while the
multinationals hovered over the militias
so they can pick up the minerals for
your iPhone
that's Belgium that's what Belgium did
in 1960. it's not just this monster
Leopold today right in front of our eyes
well I think it should be exposed in the
United States huge battle about it
we're going to see more of it in
November
and censorship is becoming much more
extreme in the United States much more
than we've discussed there is now
literal
Banning of books and libraries
if and there's a trump actually didn't
manage to pass it but he at the end of
his administration he proposed the
federal law
to been teaching in schools of anything
that might be divisive or might cause
children to feel uncomfortable
that's a code word for teaching anything
about American history like every
history of every country has plenty in
it to make people feel uncomfortable
so if you've been that you're saying
nothing but patriotic slogans okay we
all have to Goose step to command and
chant patriotic slogans that's the ideal
of the Republican party which is taking
power it's already happening in States
republican-run States they're banning
books from libraries they're not
allowing them to be written School even
people like Tony Morrison can't can't
read her in school but because it makes
Way kids feel uncomfortable uh the uh
we're moving towards what we're moving
towards in the United States is
a frightening form of a curious kind of
totalitarianism
where people aren't thrown into jail
like I'm allowed to speak but with the
kind of marginalization and demonization
that you can read in the European press
more extreme here but no Gulag but just
uh
what used to be called Soft fascism
fascism without
the concentration camps without the
extermination caps but fascism
