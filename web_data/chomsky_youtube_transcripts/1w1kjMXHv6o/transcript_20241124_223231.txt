hi everyone again thank you for your
patients who've had some technical
difficulties but finally we are on track
uh my name is diar I'm an immigration
lawyer and I'm also an activist with the
group for I'd like to briefly uh
introduce you to our group uh something
very strange happened in Turkey over the
summer of
2013 uh hundreds of thousands of people
took out to to the streets to protest as
most of you might have heard under the
of protests and it was to reclaim the
last piece of green area in the middle
of isul near txan Square however it was
much more than that millions of people
were frustrated with the increasing
authoritarianism in the country uh the
increasing police brutality and the
human rights violations and so
simultaneously around the world in many
cities including Boston New York Tokyo
La DC London uh these protests popped up
and here on June 1st 2013 a group of
almost 400 people came together in
Boston Common uh to show solidarity with
the protesters in Istanbul and in other
cities and since then we kept organizing
uh the music protest ended but we
continued to hold events panels
documentary screenings because we
decided that it's our Collective Duty um
to show solidarity with the Democracy
struggle in turkey that's still going
on um some of the events we've H held um
were talks given by ran dink she's the
founder of grink foundation the Widow of
the Armenian journalist who was
assassinated gr Ahmed ship came a
journalist who was imprisoned for
publishing a book on the Gul movement uh
SAS who uncovered the story of Alis kmas
uh who was killed by the police during
the Gaz protests and Sami Alan was with
us he's the father of barin Alan and
today is the second anniversary um of
Ban's death he was a 15-year-old boy um
and he passed away after being in a coma
for 269 days because uh he had a gas
canister um that hit his head so um also
here we'd like to remember him and all
the children uh who have been killed by
the Turkish security forces and the
police and we want to um remind their
families that we stand in solidarity
with them um our speaker tonight
Professor Chomsky needs no introduction
um but I will still say a couple of
sentences he's a world-renowned linguist
cognitive scientist philosopher social
critic and activist he's a Professor
amerus here at MIT he has received
numerous Awards recognitions and
honorary degrees all around the world
he's an outspoken critic of
neoliberalism US foreign policies around
the
world and he was gracious enough
actually to come and speak with us in a
bble event back in October
2013 along with two other professors
Professor Al
andas he gave us his is of the gizi
protests back then the title of that
event was what's happening in turkey and
tonight we're using the same title
because turkey never stops to challenge
us and we will continue to challenge
what's happening in Turkey by holding
these
talks and in fact thousands of people
continue to challenge The Authority in
Turkey the most recent example was the
Peace petition that was signed by a
group of academics to put declaring that
they will not take part in the crimes
that are going on in the conflict in the
south southeastern part of turkey and
Professor Chumps he was also one of the
signators of that peace
petition according to Human Rights
Foundation of turkey at least 142
civilians have been killed between
August 16 and February 5 these are some
estimates um but the violence is
escalating and the war in Syria is
affecting turkey and obviously the
position turkeyy is taking in that war
is also affecting the region so without
further Ado I would like to leave it to
Professor chsky um for his take on
what's Happening um the first half will
be him uh speaking to us and the second
half we will take questions uh we will
do a Q&A session we do need to pass the
microphone for the question to be heard
and to be recorded thank
you
[Applause]
the title that's TR you hear me first of
all yes yes the title that's announced
up there is pretty broad much too broad
for me to try to address these few
comments but feel free to bring up other
things later I'm going to
concentrate on turkey and it's immediate
impact on the nearby region uh I'm sure
you've read about the uh recent the
ongoing negotiations between turkey and
the European Union on
refugees the cynicism of this agreement
has come under sharp and uh quite
Justified
criticisms uh by the human rights
organizations and others uh but it's
important to recognize that the
criticism may be a little misleading in
uh one important respect it may suggest
as much as a discussion tends to do that
this is something new and it's not it's
a broken record uh not just with regard
to Turkey uh but much more generally
important to understand though I'll just
keep Atty here in
Europe one crucial matter has to do with
uh what is called the refugee crisis
there's a good bit to say about that but
I'll put it aside and pretend for the
sake of discussion that there is a
refugee crisis through exactly what that
means is interesting to look at uh
critics have pointed out that in order
to obtain Turkish Turkish agreement to
protect Europe from the so-called
Refugee crisis uh the Europeans have
agreed to
overlook ongoing and mounting Crimes of
the Turkish State these range as you've
heard from the silencing by force of
opposition voices most recent case was
the Takeover of the Zan group M
newspaper in Turkey which was mildly
critical of the government after the
takeovers producing predictably
government
propaganda from the silencing of
opposition voices to the violent and
brutal repression that's preceding in
the Southeast in the parish areas and we
can add to that uh something else which
is deserves some comment turkey's
intriguing stance with regard to Syria
which is critical to this whole
issue well the criticisms are correct
although this is true but it's quite
important to recognize that it's nothing
new whatsoever and in fact it doesn't
even begin to compare doesn't come close
to compare
to Western complicity in far worse
terish crimes in the very recent past in
fact complicity is something of an
understatement more accurately direct
and decisive
participation in quite shocking crimes
all of that's important to understand if
we want to make sense of current
events uh I'll keep here to the Post
Cold War period it's a
very enlightening period to focus on if
we want to understand how foreign policy
is designed and implemented the reason
is that in the after the collapse of the
Soviet Union it was no longer possible
[Music]
to to
Simply resort to the standard reflexive
uh cold pretext that whatever we're
doing it's because the Russians are Com
when that pretext dissolved you can see
the essence of foreign policy its design
motives implementation in a much greater
light so how did the United States react
to the end of the Cold War and how does
turkey fit into that
conception there are actually two
dimensions of this question question
that deserve close attention one has to
do with
ideology what was the ideological
reaction to the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the second has to do with the
fact what in fact
happened with regard to ideology it's
straightforward and pretty interesting
there was of course
Euphoria uh about the US victory in this
Cosmic
Al Sly quote some
very representative comments from the
leading intellectual journals New York
revie of books New York
Times uh the United States now emerged
as the leader these are quotes the
leader of the enlightened States uh for
the first time in history with the
Soviet Union G the US was able to pursue
principles and values for the first time
in history uh no more impediment it
could proceed on its mission of saving
Humanity Under The Guiding hand of an
idealistic New World bent on end in
humanity led by Bill Clinton whose
foreign policy had entered into a noble
phase with a saintly Globe by
1997 and on and on like that quite a
flow of impressive R all of this was
Amplified by a quite
remarkable PR campaign to elevate Reagan
who was incidentally never particularly
popular to elevate him to a semi Divine
figure
Colossus quot whose Spirit seems to
stride over the country watching us like
a war Friendly
Ghost kind of words that are rarely
heard outside of
P this Stanford
University
institu although the swming went Way
Beyond and it's almost Universal for
Obama and others worship of Reagan as a
transformative figure of unbelievable
magnificence well that's that's what
ideology was like what's what are the
facts like well one immediate question
of course is what happens to the two
military facts NATO and Oro fact pretty
obvious question when C war ends there
were actually two visions at the time
presented in the discussions on this
issue primarily
between
gich representing the Soviet Union and
George Bush number one Statesman Bush
and James Baker Secretary of State on
the other side also and others gb's
Vision was that both military packs
should be disolve and that a Eurasian
zone of Peace should be created
Cooperative zone of peace from Lisbon to
L with number of centers the centers in
Brook and Moscow and anara perhaps
farther east uh the the US had a
different alternative namely the warso
pack should be resolved of
course and NATO instead of dissolving
should
expand first NATO should expand to East
Germany that was actually in violation
of verbal promises to gorbage
B had made quite a remarkable
concession he had agreed to allow
Germany to be unified and to join a
hostile military Alliance native look at
the history of the preceding Century a
pretty astonishing concession that
Germany alone had practically wiped out
Russia several times in the century of
killing tens of millions of people
destroying the country repeatedly and
GBF was saying okay Germany can be
unified and join a military alliance
with by the United States which is
obviously hosle he did insist on a quick
Pro quote namely that Germany that NATO
would not expand the phrase was one in
to the
east that was the phrase that meant East
Germany that we contemplated anything
beyond and he did receive a promise to
that effect from the US which
immediately Reed on it and moved NATO to
East
Germany FR plan but he was instructed
that it was only a verbal promise there
was nothing on paper and the implication
is if you're stupid enough to believe in
a gentleman's agreement with us what
happen to your
problem didn't quite Express that way uh
after moving to East Germany NATO under
Clinton uh then expanded uh right to the
Russian
border uh the this was a move that was
pretty harshly criticized by many US
uh high
level senior Statesman George Canon and
others described the expansion of NATO
as in their words a tragic mistake uh
policy error of historic
proportions uh we are now seeing the
consequences as the expansion continued
by a few years ago 28 and
2013 NATO officially
uh offered Ukraine the opportunity to
join NATO quite apart from longstanding
historical cultural connections most
Ukrainian is Russian connection goes way
back this is the eff parland of Russian
geostrategic concerns that no matter who
was in charge in Russia they consider
this a really major threat uh and the
effect we're now seeing conflict
Ukraine very serious conflict both sides
by now NATO troops are right on the
Russian
border first time since the second world
war that hle armies have been at the
Russian border some memories there about
what this meant both sides now are
expanding their military forces and the
US is qur the Madeo Mission at the
border of Russians doing the same
they're both thing very provocative
acts
NATO heavy armed NATO forces US forces
are carrying out Maneuvers literally
hundreds of yards from the Russian
border Russ's acting the same way if you
look at the arms control journals of
Arms Control today they point out they
warant fact that both sides are acting
as if war is thinkable they're both
acting in ways which could
escalate up the point where War would
break out uh anyone who has looked at
the really shocking record of
the the history of nuclear weapons since
last last since 19 since late
1940s we'll understand there's the time
to wind with now but the fact is that if
you look at this record you can see that
it's it's absolute miracle that we've
survived we've come very close to to
nuclear war and that means terminal War
uh for everyone many many times and in
fact new cases keep being revealed just
a couple of weeks ago it revealed that u
in
1979 the uh us automated detection
systems both the US and Russia have
automated syst systems which try to
detect oncoming attacks the US ones are
far more sophisticated us systems are
satellite run which means you can see
everywhere all the way into Russia the
Russian systems are basically radar eyes
so they're much more sensitive and
surely have nothing like the
sophistication of us systems we know the
record in some detail on the US side and
you can be C but the on the Russian side
must be much worse anyway this is on the
US side one of many cases in
1979 the US automated systems detected a
major missile attack from the Soviet
Union taken seriously enough so that
went past the Joint Chiefs of Staff up
to the National Security advisor vinski
he was literally on the telephone ready
to call President Carter to instruct him
to launch a retaliatory attack which
means the end of the human species when
a mage came in saying there was a false
alarm one of hundreds and hundreds of
false alarm of the few periods that have
been studying in detail show literally
often hundreds a year on the Russian
side it's got be much worse and some of
these cases are really mind B won't go
into anyway that's what we're doing now
both sides escalating
us rapidly increasing forces Russians to
recently Russian military plane with it
transponder off the military ples flying
fly both both sides transponders off
detected the Russian military plane came
within seconds of hitting a Danish
commercial J with people and who what
would happened after that these are the
kind of things that could easily set off
the terminal War these are direct
consequences of the expansion of NATO
which was as Ken other said tragic
mistake of policy error of the star
proportions now especially when it
extends
to offers to incorporate Ukraine into
the NATO system well so one reaction to
the collapse of the Soviet Union was to
extend Nat Russ's bers another was to
change NATO's Mission radically change
NATO's mission for the previous year
since arge NATO had been presented as a
force intended to defend the west from
the Russian hordes no more Russian
hordes so we extend Nat to Russia's
borders and furthermore its mission was
officially extended officially to become
a
worldwide military system uh with the
goal of protecting the global Energy
System that means pipelines sea Lanes
that's the world and also to serve as a
intervention Force under us command us
intervention force and of course one
consequence of Cold War is that
intervention becomes much easier the
deter going all that so do two
visions course was rejected the other
one is what was
that Turkey Point turkey turkey remained
as it had been a crucial NATO Outpost
crucial GE strategic position facing
facing pointing directly into the Middle
East quite
important with the uh Cold War over it
was no longer possible to pretend that
us and British intervention in violence
was in defense against the Russian
threat now appeared and in fact when the
uh when the Soviet Union
collaps the bush one Administration did
come out with a number of policy
decisions in doing defense strategy and
the budget and they're quite interesting
uh one major point was that the military
the vast military system had to be
maintained but not against the Russians
because they disappeared but in order to
defend ourselves from the technological
sophistication that's the phrase used
from the technological sophistication of
third world countries we really have
to for that so we need military system
second point was that it was necessary
maintain what was called the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism for
Hightech industry people like us and in
the center of part of the place where
the public funds taxpayer funds are used
to develop the technology the economy of
the future for the benefit of corporate
profit so that's demense industrial base
and that of course has to be maintained
and third and what is most interesting
had the Middle East said we have to
maintain intervention forces aimed at
the Middle East and then came this
interesting phrase the Middle East where
the major problems we Face could not be
laid at the kremlin's door so they
weren't the problems weren't the
Russians sorry folks we've been lying to
you for half a century but uh now we
have to uh recognize the reality clouds
have lifted the problem is and always
was what's called radical nationalism
meaning independent nationalism that
disobeys where it's not under control so
that's what the problem was the problems
could not be laid at's door
face what about turkey right at this
time turkey was ES ating a vicious
counterinsurgency campaign targeting the
K population in the
Southeast uh much worse than today those
small
matter maybe 40 or 50,000 people were
killed
3500 towns and Villages were wiped out
every imaginable kind of per Terror was
taking place hundreds of thousands of
curds by some ES millions of Kurds were
driven out of the southeast
refugees many of them driven to the SS
of Istanbul and happen to be visiting
towards the end of this campaign visited
some of the isul slones where you found
the families living in a room in
condemned buildings uh unable to go
outside because it's
crime some was that uh they actually
were given permission by the Turkish
government to return to their Villages
and towns but only on condition that
they signed a statement saying that the
villages have been destroyed by the pkk
kurish gorillas which they wasn't true
destroyed by the Army then just refus to
sign and Contin I presume still continue
to live under those horrendous C
C which incidentally nobody in seems to
know about these slums are often them
there is nobody
goes that's uh that what was happening
at the time uh it's a major power story
so what was the reaction of the uh
enlightened States and the leader of the
the idealistic New World mum ending in
humanity to these ongoing parts a native
country straightforward us was providing
the arms 80% of the arms carry out these
atrocities were supplied by the Clinton
Administration mounting as the
atrocities mounted uh turkey in fact
became the world leader for recipient of
us arms there's a qualification there's
a separate category Israel and Egypt
they're off somewhere
else and Egypt Egypt because of
Israel basically
is
that the tur took the lead in proing the
US
arms uh in uh
1997 remember that was the year when
Clinton's foreign policy entered into a
noble phase with the St Le glow in that
year Clinton sent more arms to Turkey
single year that the entire Cold War
period combined up to the onset of the
in of the cter
Insurgency um this uh that was the same
glob Americans knew very little about
this and for one simple reason the Press
refused to report it of course everyone
had
a Europe in anara New werek Times
everyone else but couldn't find this out
there were some
report Human Rights Watch was reporting
that John
K CIS was reporting that couple of other
people joh the Rand but we really had to
work to find out about it well that was
the sly flow of the enlightened States
the cynicism about this peak in an
interesting way in
1999 nato in 1999 had
anniversary it was a pretty somber
anniversary there was lots of concern
about crimes being carale in the bans
which were pretty ugly but didn't even
begin to compare with atrocities that
the US was backing all over the world at
the same time uh but of course the
bulans are
different the lament was how can we
Europeans tolerate atrocities going on
right near the border of Europe that's
hard on the other hand it was quite easy
to tolerate incomparably worse
atrocities going on right within NATO
not on its borders but within NATO with
the direct decisive contribution of
primarily the United States but other
native Powers as
well that was never
mentioned at the NATO meetings or in the
commentary
that's impressive
cism U by the year 2000 the Kurdish
insury been pretty much suppressed the
Turkish government remained control and
the arms Flo to Turkey therefore reduced
was no longer necessary
to lead the enlightened States in their
Global phase so turkey dropped out of
first place of course another country
had to replace it it was replaced by
Columbia which had by far the worst
human rights Rec in the Western
Hemisphere and now moved to first place
in receiving arms from the United States
inly there's actually nothing new about
this they go back to 1980 there was a
important study by the leading academic
specialist on human rights in Latin
America L schz he studied the relation
between us Aid including military aid
and what you call egregious human rights
violations and they were pretty
egregious or in he found a very close
correlation academic article that we PID
any attention there was another study
done at the same time by
uh friend colleague coauthor of M Edward
Herman an economist at the won School of
the University of Pennsylvania he
studied the relation between us Aid
including military a and right through
the Carter years uh US military aid and
improvements in the climate for business
operations so in terms of repatriation
profits and so on and so forth and it
was indeed a very close correlation that
makes sense it's understandable that US
policy would be directed to Improvement
in investor rights and business
operations and so on there's a second
Point how do you improve the climate for
business operation well the best way is
to murder union leaders and assassinate
the human rights activists to Massacre
working people with
peasants chemical warfare and peasant
areas all of this improves enormously
the uh climent for uh business
operations there is a therefore there is
a secondary
cor correlation between military aid and
human rights violations it's not that
the United States is dedicated to
torture and murder it's just that this
is a conom of of an actual
gold commitment to improving the climate
for business operations and that after
the early 80s that the study is anymore
during the re years it was so obvious
that a study would have been
Superfluous now talking about what
happened in the '90s and later when also
super well that's we're now off to 2000
in the following years the situation in
did improve notably improve there was uh
some recognition of Elementary Kurdish
rights it was limited
options CS to use their language quite
limited before that was
Lethal and in general was a kind of a
relaxation of the situation I I visited
a couple times other people Vis it and
seen it as well there was also
Improvement not marvelous but
Improvement in the climate for freedom
of speech and quite interestingly there
was the beginning of willingness to
discuss among the public at least the
question of the Armenian Slaughter back
a century ago with call The Armenian
Genocide I was there couple years ago as
a
lecture there's a Lector ship in honor
of
front the journalist who exposing the
tur atrocities against the Armenians he
was murdered right outside his uh the
building where his offices were anual
Lector ship there was there was a huge
March through is so big that the police
didn't try to control it
supporting exposure of the
atrocities honor of PR in it ended right
in front of his building publish where
he
was and actions took place as well so
for example ja here
the southeast sort of
capital in year 2000 first time I
visited there was it was it was J here
was the place where one of the last
major massacres took place with
Armenians and there was I asked to see
The Armenian Church there was an
Armenian Church B Armenian Church so as
I can see it they kind of reluctantly
took me over was W and falling apart
roof falling and so on then asked see if
there had been anyone who collected any
relics from the church and I was taken
to a small store
near an old Armenian man collected
relics that was 2000 couple years later
Turkish groups in istan began a campaign
to rebuild the church reconstructed and
apparently I haven't seen it apparently
it's been rebuilt
there's all of these were beginnings of
indications of real improvements the
climate in Turkey was pretty impressive
that was up to about 10 years ago then
ited the government has continually
become
authoritarian quickly gain the best
record in the world for regression of
journalists uh it's now getting much
worse as we heard uh but bad as it is
and it's bad enough worth bearing in
mind that it is nothing like what
happened very recently with decisive us
C European support so the current
cynicism while real is just a pale
shadow of what's happened before and
possibly a portent of what's coming all
of this is Rec and it's in the back of
everyone's mind well the curfews now in
the Southeast have reached in some areas
100 days there are many deaths people
afraid to go out of their homes because
of sniper attacks heavy military
equipment in the streets we don't know
much about what's happening as you just
heard partly because human rights
investigators and lawyers are just ban
so you can only get as you heard from
the comments of phone calls and so on
there are individual cases which give
some of the
picture some cases Amnesty International
just released a couple weeks ago a
chilling report on the oppression one
example they write that in a telling
example of how little tolerance the
authorities have for any form of desent
regarding the operations on the 9th of
January State prosecutors initiated the
criminal investigation for making the
official charge was making propaganda
for a terrorist organization it was
issued against a chat show host the
investigation was launched after a
caller to the show said that mothers and
children were being killed in the
Southeast and urged people not to stay
silent about it the chat show hosts
thanked and applauded her for her
contribution saying he supported her
call for peace it was a media fur death
threats against those involved
investigation against the chat show host
the head of the television program the
caller
followed that's the nature illustrates
the oppression just mention one more
case one of the most outrageous cases is
the attack on seven n young who's in
prison been in prison for 2 years over
two years he's right now facing a Lely
25e sentence his crime is that he has
been devoted completely selflessly for
years to saving old villages building
houses planting vegetation creating jobs
creating environmental sanctuaries in a
really Saint like Manner and in opposing
laws he once broke seals placed by the
authorities that's the crime be in jail
for the rest of his life if there's no
substantial progress but the individual
cases and there are plenty of them that
barely hint that the severity is the
repression the attack on free expression
the bit attack on thecourage population
of the southeast which can hardly fail
to elicit Grim memories of what happened
not many years ago but all of this is
connected to what's going on in the
neighborhood regions of Iraq and
Syria the major Ground Forces
combating Isis ofal Islamic State in
both countries the major ground forces
are Kurdish there are detailed reports
by West journalists and researchers from
FR L recently important study by Scott
Adan Bri from the front lines one of the
main researchers
ones posted on the internet they make it
quite clear that the Kurdish militias of
the pkk the T Turkish Kurdish militias
based in Northern Iraq and the ypg in
Syria these are different names but very
closely linked they are the ones who are
in the Forefront of the resistance to
Isis uh in Iraqi Kurdistan they are the
ones who prevented Isis from conquering
Iraqi Kurdistan when they were on the
March they're the ones who saved the
remnants of the aides from total
Destruction PL of Isis uh
in in Syria they the ground forces
protecting the curds holding back Isis M
into Isis territory and meanwhile quite
amazingly they're apparently developing
a remarkably eent Society in Syria
consider circumstances and they are the
primary enemies of turkey turkey's uh
actions in both countries are primarily
directed against these forces uh pkk is
also on the US terrorist this
meanwhile the point is that turkey
simply does not
want kurtish
area anywhere near its border because of
his own repression and control of its
Kurdish Kurdish regions inside most ofs
in the world turkey meanwhile turkey is
been being given is giv CD support for
Rices it's not very secret it's
providing a funnel for jihadis move into
the Islamic State area is allowing
Commerce out of oil and so on and it's
it's at the same time quite openly
supporting the
al-Qaeda in Syria in
this which like Isis is excluded from
International negotiations as a
terrorist force of the radical islamists
it's also incidentally supported by us
allies Saudi araban C this
ConEd Syrian tragedy and in all in all
of this disgraceful tragedy Eran has a
very strong card to play and he's
playing it he can exploit Europe's
miserable reaction to the soal refugee
crisis as he's now doing in the ongoing
European Union turkey negotiations but
we should bear in mind that we're hardly
in a position to criticize it the US is
much worse taking no Syrian refugees we
have to be very cautious here some
Syrian doctor might be terrorist and
disguise that this is the safest country
in the world also the most frightened
way back in American history and much
worse than that is what you're doing
with regard to Central America uh the
refugees from Central America are fleing
from us Terror and violence we destroy
their countries they flee we then send
them back uh we pressure Mexico to do
exactly what the European Union is doing
with regard to Turkey to keep them away
from our borders for Mexicans are
fleeing too largely also our victims
many of them victims of NAFTA
predictably wiped out Mexican agure the
Mexican compos can be quite efficient
but they can't compete with highly
subsidized us Agro business and what are
called free trade agreements uh but so
when you w the place you then keep them
away I'll put aside the racist
gra Trump and others but all all it's
not a very attractive picture of the
enlightened States and the idealistic
new world event on in humanity and it's
a picture that we have it in our power
to change and something that we better
do so and
fast
okay for questions we do need to pass
the
microphone
Professor tomsky um I am a teacher and I
teach here in
the um I teach here in the US but I also
develop curriculum for many countries
internationally and so many of the
atrocities you're talking about occur I
think because governments can work in
the sort of Safe Harbor of
public
uninform I'm curious what you would
think the role of educating and
specifically educating young people both
here in America and internationally
would be in order to improve public
awareness and put more pressure on this
governments to prevent them from
creating these sort of
atrocities I'm
sorry
[Music]
what we want our children to be should
they be passive
obedient State propaganda or should they
be citizens of the function
Society who have enough understanding of
the world to participate in decisions
that are
morally Justified
[Music]
and fact perly feasible that's a truth
and if
we that's a question about the
educational system in fact for the
United States the kind of a deeper
question is do we want our children even
to know that the world
exists the United States remarkably ins
societ that many people know almost
nothing about the outside
world it's kind of understandable and if
you're a
European if you travel 100 miles you
hear a different language different
culture you see momentos from earlier
centuries a rich cultural tradition in
the United States if you go from Boston
to Los Angeles you might as well be in
the same place the a little
different it's it's a rich closed
Society you to go very far
away the end result is it's just
extremely I mean sometimes
as but so the question is do we want our
children to understand that there's a
world uh do we want them to understand
that the US plays a decisive crucial
role in the world because of its
enormous wealth and power do we want
them to know what the actions are that
they share responsibility for do we want
them to know how the world looks
us let me give you a concrete example
there are regular polls taken of
international
opinion by major US polling agencies
Gallop po major US polling agencies they
asked all sorts of questions but one of
the questions they ask is which country
is the greatest threat to World
Peace who do you think
wins the United States in the lead by a
huge margin nobody
close and second place way below is
Pakistan and that's primarily because of
the Indian
gr if you ask in the United States
what's the greatest threat of the world
of Peace the answer you get toally
you're
in not in the world do Americans know
anything about
this no they can't the Press literally
refuses to report it refuses it's not
that they don't know this is a g
poll polls are reported but not this so
do we want Americans to know something
about
things those are the questions about
what kind of educational system not just
schools also the information syst
universities media and so on
[Music]
May thank you Professor to thank you
very much for um accepting the
invitation of you gave us a lot of for
thought on a subject and a title that
was may be a little broad like you said
but I'm going to ask you three very
specific questions I listen to you very
carefully um you talked about 1999 in
turkey and how somehow the arm shipments
the crazy arm shipments from the US were
lessoning but you did not mention
something very important and that was
the capture of a that was 1999 and I
wonder if um what your comment is that
probably for to state was the reason why
maybe the states were not as high
because things kind of change the next
following years the second one I
couldn't help but notice but you
mentioned 1915 and you said the
slaughter of Armenians that was your
words and then later you said what made
all theun genocide and I'm just curious
to know if you would like to qualify it
name genocide not the third one is sa sh
obviously a pathetic pathetic situation
however I do want to ask you um do you
would you say that that is a very
horrible example of authoritarianism by
the church State because two options one
because
the sentence is extremely harsh um or is
it because s should have been allowed to
actually go against zoning
laws um something that some people may
think uh should have been preserved
thank
you
[Music]
words
[Music]
correct question
about he was the uh P leader pkk he was
captured in prison prison ever
since I think it was 1999 yeah uh is uh
I'm not sure exactly what the question
is about that's what happened uh that's
part of the
uh ongoing struggle between turkey and
spish population since then oon has been
changed his positions quite a lot while
in prison he's for one thing call
for a peace negotiation and reduce the
claims the P claims to calls for kind of
some level of autonomy within turkey
rather than independent
kurdan and uh it's he's the one who
has he's still regarded as basically the
Leader by the per populations
in
pkk Syria
and his advocacy
of women's rights Democratic
Society Cooperative communities
borrowing a lot from and American
Anarchist has apparently influenced the
significantly the actions being taken in
Syria by the relatively
independent Kurdish populations here I'm
not sure that's what your question was
directed
to um no but I don't want to take time
away from let go to the second
okay was this should be what I call the
slaughter sometimes called genocide of
the Armenian shouldn't be called
genocide actually iare I don't use the
word genocide anymore the word genocide
has been so vulgarized and
trivialized for political reasons that I
think the term is still over
usable so I I simply don't use it even
for cases that you are quite CL by old
former usage
Clos so the worst case since the second
world war is East te where maybe a third
or quter of the population was wiped out
the US
support a per capita Slaughter that wins
the championship and many C of genocide
have been very much involved in the
course for many years but called the
genocide maybe
virtual I think the terms just been
destroyed by
vulgarization
and politically directed use
so call genocide other things if you use
the seriously in something like it's
originally intended sense yeah but not
in the current V
sense
about the question was is
the am I speaking about the crime or the
sentencing well the crime was breaking a
seal in the course of the environmental
protection activities so yes that's a
CME maybe you get a two days of
community
service getting 25
years you decide
what Professor jsky um first of all uh
uh with new Association we are
organization based here in New England
and as British activist I would like to
say thank you for everything you have
done with the Kurds CDs live in a very
rough neighborhood in the Middle East
and there are there are a lot of uses as
you have told us this evening uh you
have been a great help you having a
great voice of conscious for for the
kurs and for that we are very much
grateful for for for for for the voice
and as we would
say that I have three questions and the
questions are basically for the first
one you just mentioned in 1990s mass
human rights violations in 1990s during
the era basically 4,000 VES were burned
in Turkey by our weapons here in America
basically Cobra word Cobra was one of
the most common word used among the
kurish population in The Villages that
didn't understand Turkish or any English
but the word Cobra was one of the most
common words because Cobra burn villes
and ,000 people went missing 2 and half
million people become internal refugees
and at that time we as British act in
America we struggled trying to raise the
awareness of what's happening in to the
British population turkey unfortunately
now we see a similar situation happening
again in JRA in in in cabora in many
many different cities and towns and and
and you know you see kurish R line up
against the wall in the biggest kurish
cities in in Turkey it's like seems you
would you would think that this is prois
territories of Syria and International
Community again turns death ears to the
CSH Brama happening in turkey and turkey
as you mention is a NATO country and
despite that we are not seeing the NATO
allies NATO members na to France telling
their friend turkey to stop killing
massing its kurish population and for
the question inre to this is what we as
British actors what would you recommend
for us to raise awareness to our so that
they can help us to to um put a pressure
in Turkey so that this could be stopped
that is first question
second the second question this is in
regards to what turkey's relationship
with Syria conflict in Syria mainly um
get to the level where it is today
turkey has a big role in it those of us
are familiar with the region know very
while thaty has Europe Jihad around the
world have through through the Border
like they going to
vacation let's keep it short sure and
for this so again there's a lot of list
of things happen has been doing in
recent memory for you know 3 four five
years with conflict in Syria and um we
all know about it the people that are
have any interest in Turkey they know
about it the question is nobody did
anything about it except either today or
was yesterday remember reading an
article in Washington Post where two
former ambassadors to Turkey Ambassador
Elman and Ambassador are saying is that
the basically it's about time for
everyone to go my question in regards to
this why do you think the timeing is now
not last year the year before all these
things happen why is now and the third
third question very and that
is what would you say is the mr's role
in peace process in you see a day play a
peace a role in the peace process in
like
question could
you
[Music]
what is O's what should O's role be in
the
negotiations well he's see as far as the
courage are concerned he's exposing so
he obviously has to play a major role in
the peace negotiations but also he's
been whatever one thinks about his
past he's been in recent years taking a
pretty constructive position I think uh
both with regard to the peace
negotiations and also with regard to
social policy so I think that's a second
reason why should certainly be
given peace negotiation
in my view he shouldn't be the Pres I
think so that that I don't see much
debatable about the if there's going to
be any kind of a peace settlement he'll
obviously have to play a ma Ro and
should uh as far as the kurish community
here
is concerned well they should be in the
Forefront of trying to carry out the
educ bad badly needed educational
process of getting Americans to
understand what's going on you can't put
pressure on the American government to
change policy unless people know what
the policy is now right now it's
not the United States that's in the
Forefront of supporting Turkish
oppression it does indirectly by not
criticizing it um uh and it should be
doing it you shouldn't just hear this
from Human Rights Watch this should be
coming from the
government there is in fact just today a
call from the Kurdish Human Rights group
in London which is the name
International cour Rights group called
to uh get the NATO power to expel turkey
from NATO okay that's
what everyone thinks that as a tactic
the background for understanding this
has to be understood by the populations
of the United States and Europe if
there's not to be any constructive
action here in the 1990s it was really
scandalous there was literally virtually
no
information almost nothing kind of Real
Horror Stories going on decisively
decisively support by the United States
and people simply didn't know so it was
impossible to build up any purpose
that's and CS here who are in close
connection and I do about what's going
on we should be working hard to spread
word organize carry out
protests this
so okay just one question please and try
to keep it brief so we can get as many
questions as possible and whoever's
doing the Periscope uh live stream you
know reboot it because there's a 20
minute limit it's not anyer streaming
live so my question is going to be about
our mistake I'm here what is our mistake
is the question so since
1990s there is a anti neoliberal
movement in this world we we can start
it from zapatistas in Mexico or from the
1999 Seattle Seattle protests the 2000s
there was this world social forum and
the European social Forum there was a
huge anti-war movement and in
2010 during the 2010s people went to
streets and took the streets occupied
the squares in in Spain in Greece in
Turkey in tah in Egypt and also in us
with the occupied wall stre M and
there's this black Liv matter mov but
they are all appearing and then
disappearing and they cannot transform
to a political moment that can change
the societies so what what what is our
mistake what do you think about
this
well these the movements that you
mentioned all been very important and I
think they reflect
the vast amount of public opinion so
what are we not doing right we're not
Turing them into ongoing unified
continuing social movements that is a
very live example right now the uh
Sanders campaign
is mobiz a lot of people enthi most
young people and it has an
opportunity which it could grasp now or
might
lose this is an important moment will it
create will it use the momentum to
create the basis for organization which
will Outlast the election um there's a
regular process here going on for years
there's we have something kind of an
extravaganza that goes on every four
years
elal and the propaganda system says
that's what you focus on and then when
it's over you go home and
forget that happens over and over quite
often a lot of enthusiasm was built up
for the campaign but say the Obama
campaign you lot of enthusiasm and
excitement you it was misplaced but
whereever you think about it it was
there it disappeared as soon as the
election took place in fact Obama tried
to turn it into a organization that
would support his
policies but it should have been as an
organization would oppose this policy
but
anyway same thing happened with rainbow
C
it happens over and over that's part of
the pretense that what matters for
social change for social policy is the
elector St against I mean it's not
totally insignificant but it's a minor
part of bringing about the kinds of
changes and policies that are
desperately needed but of course
propaganda just focuses on that so you
push the button and go home and be a
nice passive citizen
uh so the question now is
well in the ongoing Sanders c campaign
are can steps be taken now not not after
November Now to turn it into a movement
which is going to continue and it will
continue um
to pursue the kinds of programs and
policies that are desperately needed
typically in opposition the government
will do for good reasons because the
government answers different different
interests and different
prayers that's the Live question now I
think that's the the immediate question
which we will give the
response
question hi professor uh it was an honor
to listen to you this evening I along
with my friends traveled from Al to
listen to you my question is
specifically not about Middle East but
about a similar policy of the United
States adopted towards Indian policy in
the Indian occupied Kashmir in Kashmir
for 30 years now as you know there have
been tremendous violation of Human
Rights and the world seems absolutely
silent about it so my question spe
specifically is that with the growing
intolerence in India having right-wing
government at the center with the cases
of lynching of Muslims meeting be with
the uh charges of SED being pressed
against a student activist who was
actually talking about the judicial
murder of a kashmiri freedom fighter
what can the United States role or why
has United States being so silent about
what's going on in Kashmir for three
decades now I am a Kashmir and I have
really gone through all of that thank
you very
much
you want to talk
about we have here a journalist who's
barred from India because D talk about
cas
it
iSell Kashmir is probably the most under
reported uh tragedy in the world today
uh since the uprising began in 1989 tens
of thousands of kashmir's have been
killed hundreds of thousands have been
imprisoned uh tortured uh treated in the
most abominable ways imaginable and this
is all being done by the world's largest
democracy which uh obviously fears
someone like me uh and thus I'm banned
from traveling to India because it is um
you know I'm considered a threat to uh
National Security so this is an issue
that has been smoldering uh for decades
since the partition of
1947 uh under very murky circumstances a
Muslim majority state had a Hindu
Maharaja who supposedly signed a piece
of paper that now has gone missing
incidentally and no one seems to find
this document that the Indian State
keeps referring to to legitimize its rle
uh I mean this it's a complicated
situation all situations are complicated
but uh Neu at the time the Prime
Minister promised the International
Community that there would be a pleite
to honor the wishes of the Kashmir
people if they wanted to join Pakistan
if they wanted to be independent or
whether they wanted to stay uh with
India that was uh quickly forgotten and
buried in the dusin of history and the
Indian state has cemented its grip
on Kashmir it is probably the most
densely militarized Zone uh in the world
but uh also India has been very skillful
in its H propaganda campaign here in the
United States and in Europe so many
people when you mention India think of
yoga
and vegetarianism and Gandhi Buddha and
sitar music and vas and R shunka and all
these wonderful things which existed in
India but this story and Other Stories
of repression are completely buried and
it really it's going to require an
Intrepid Intrepid journalists uh to go
there and to expose what is going on uh
by the Indian
State
thanks two last questions were taken and
I think it was already
here
hello um my name is roel um I ask really
short
questions and um I'm a recent graduate
cultural anthropology and my brother he
got a masters in what did he me in
history of international relation so we
just had a quick question I'm happy to
be here to so uh first question is um
when in your view is Euro American
intervention Justified and what role
should the US play in Main maintaining
peace around the world one question and
the second question is who has the
better long-term strategy with Syria the
US Russia or Assad
himself
as far as
second it's not easy to think of first
of all nobody has a decent policy for Sy
nobody that I can think of Assad is a
hideous mass murderer the Russian
intervention like any violent
interventions don't to make things worse
to the United States it's even hard to
determine what the
is and our
allies say our Turkish Ally one of our
main allies is supporting the uh
Al-Qaeda affiliate openly and the
Islamic State
passively uh the support for the
al-Qaeda affiliate is pretty remarkable
and you may remember a couple of months
ago the Pentagon announced that uh after
having spent you know who knows how many
millions of dollars in training socaled
moderate syrians 50 of them were being
sent to Syria to fight they landed in
Syria they were immediately annihilated
by the AL front turkey associate or else
just you know defected went home and
left their weapons turns out that turkey
was actually
notified their U had affiliate that the
uh
usces were coming uh meanwhile the
United States is giving assistance to
the Syrian curs who are under attack by
turkey and the their branch
in Iraq pkk is on the US terrorist list
so can't get support even though they're
the ones who were fighting off
places and other us allies katar and
Saudi Arabia are supporting
the the al-Qaeda
affili Russia supporting usad they're
also monstrous it's hard to compare them
but it's it's the only slim on serious
which was you know really the center of
the AR culture and history actually
thousands of years is
just suicide literal suicide being
destroyed there's a slim hope and that
is that somehow there will be ceasefires
and local maybe General and some kind of
Peace negotiations and it's actually
beginning to move forward a little the
the ceasefire that was announced the
international one is partially Bly and
it's cutting down the number of PES for
the first time in a long time that
opening can be extended and pursued and
and if the US will agree to allow all
the r powers in including Iran
personally uh then maybe there's some
hope
fora um I hard to think of anything else
it's a real awful
situation U as far as the US role is
concerned I mean I think we can you know
we can issue pla
like it should be to make things better
but the real question is what do you do
in particular circumstances you have to
take a look at particular cases and ask
what you be doing there so for example
what should be doing with uh regard
to uh Central
America Central America the United
States goes back for years but we've
turned it into a torture chamber
all kind 1980s Mass Mur Slaughter
something like J close to genocide in
the May
Islands what you would be doing about it
I think massive reparations and they
take the refugees for FL there they
don't want to come to the United States
they much prefer to live in their own
countries if it's possible good let's
make it possible instead of building
walls let's make it possible for them to
do they have right to do live decent
lives in their own countes which we
destroyed that's one case and you can go
have to look at the individual cases
just there's no General principle except
principle so abstract
that this is the last question I'm
sorry
with the Russian intervention in in
Syria are witnessing a new redefining of
the
bord
in the Middle East is very important the
borders in the Middle East are imperial
imposed borders which had nothing to do
with the interests of the
population uh same in Africa the same
all over the world with the European PL
spray uh the borders are designed for
the interest of the Imperial Powers they
me had experienced this
myself 60 years ago
Liv a Jeep came along a road behind me
and a guy got up started yelling to me
and said come back here at the long
country
I by now it's and
so none of these words mean anything to
the populations in
Afghanistan the border between
Afghanistan and Pakistan the r line was
imposed by the British for the arm IND
controlling India splits the pan areas
in half they've never accepted it no
Afghan governments ever accepted that
when uh P villagers cross the border may
call terorists K with drones visit their
cousin something like that the US
Mexico established by confest was a
pretty open border until years ago
people we cross people s
people on both
sides this goes all around the world but
what about the Bard in the Middle East
they were opposed in the famous SE Lego
treat France for their own interests
carved up the
way they wanted nothing to do with the
people it's all over the world you take
a look at the major conflicts going on
Africa so on most of them have to do
with the orders that were imposed by
European uh and they have no legitimacy
and it's pretty well known that one of
the uh actions that Isis carried out
that made them pretty popular was uh
one of their first videos was a video
showing bulldozers knocking down the
barrier
between Iraq and
Syria designed by the British for their
interests so what should happened in
these quarters I think this should be Ro
and it can be done in fact something
similar has happened in Europe it's
worth remembering that for centuries
Europe was actually the most Savage
place in the world the Europeans their
main goal was the stage
of 30 years war in the 17th century
probably third of the population of
Germany was right there and it went on
right through the horrible 20th century
since 1945 it change not because of any
kind of new in new
Angelic Discovery it's just that
Europeans realized that the next time
they play this game they going to wipe
out everything so therefore okay fig
game's over now we'll start to try to
set up something rational and the shanon
agreement which allows free movement
inside the European Union is a maor step
forward it's now under threat because
the awful reaction miserable disgraceful
reaction of the refugees but it was an
important step forward and it CHS it can
be done and it should be done I think in
the middle
[Applause]
