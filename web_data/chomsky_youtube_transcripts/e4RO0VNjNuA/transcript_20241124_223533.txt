well going back to Gonzales President's
Council then he transmitted to the
president the conclusion of the Justice
Department that the president has the
authority to rescind the Geneva
Conventions the supreme law of the land
under the US Constitution and the
foundation of modern international
humanitarian law and Gonzales advised
the president that this would be a good
idea in his words it substantially
reduces the threat of domestic criminal
prosecution of administration officials
under the War Crimes Act of 1996 which
carries the death penalty for grave
breaches of the Geneva Conventions so he
better resend them quickly well we can
see right on today's front pages why the
justice department was right to be
concerned that the president and his
advisors might be subject to the death
penalty under the laws passed by the
Republican Congress in 1996 and of
course under the principles of Nuremberg
if anyone took them seriously two weeks
ago on the front page of the New York
Times prominently displayed was a
picture a picture of Fallujah General
Hospital the accompanying story said
patients and hospital employees were
rushed out of rooms by armed soldiers in
order to sit or lie on the floor while
troops tied their hands behind their
backs and that's what the picture shows
armed soldiers standing over people
lying patients and doctors lying on the
floor with their hands tied behind their
backs and that's described in the
stories and the front page stories an
important achievement quote New York
Times it shut down a propaganda weapon
for the militants Fallujah General
Hospital had been producing a stream of
reports of civilian casualties and these
inflated figures I mean inflated because
our leader so declares were in flaming
opinion throughout the
country and the region driving up the
political costs of the conflict it's
only the word conflict is it by now
common euphemism for us aggression as
when we read on the same front pages
that the u.s. must now rebuild what the
conflict just destroyed a conflict has
no agents kind of like a hurricane that
happens and then we have to come in and
rebuild well let's go back to the
picture and the story about the closing
of the propaganda weapon the main
hospital now there are some relevant
documents including the Geneva
Conventions so here's a principle of the
Geneva Conventions fixed establishments
and mobile medical units of the medical
service may in no circumstances be
attacked and shall at all times be
respected and protected by parties to
the conflict so page one of the world's
leading newspaper is cheerfully
depicting war crimes for which the
political leadership could be sentenced
to death under US law no wonder that the
Attorney General warned the President as
his counsel that he should use the
constitutional authority that the
Justice Department concocted to rescind
the supreme law of the land adopting the
concept of presidential sovereignty
devised by Hitler's primary legal
advisor the true eminence grise of the
Bush administration according to a
distinguished conservative authority on
constitutional law writing and perhaps
the most respectable and sober journal
in the country well the world's greatest
newspaper also tells us quoted that the
US military achieved nearly all their
objectives in Fallujah well ahead of
schedule leaving much of the city and
smoking ruins but it was not uncoating
but it was not a complete success why
there was little evidence of dead pack
rats in their Warren's or theirs or the
streets those are their words not mine
they did find a body of a dead woman
although it's not known whether she was
in Iraqi or a foreigner that's the only
question that's raised and apparently
the only one that comes to mind is all
right in the front pages of the world's
greatest newspaper the front page
account also quotes a marine commander
who says it ought to go down in the
history books perhaps it should if so we
know very well on what page of history
it'll go down and who will be right
beside it along with those who praised
it or for that matter even tolerate it
one might at least mention the
counterparts that immediately come to
mind like for example the Russian
destruction of Grozny ten years ago it's
a city of about the same size or
schreiber nietzsche which is almost
universally described as genocide in the
West in that case as we know in detail
from a extensive Dutch government report
and other sources this Muslim enclaves
and served territory which was very
lightly protected was being used as a
base for attacks against served villages
and when the anticipated reaction took
place it was horrendous the Serbs Grove
drove out all but military age men and
then moved into killem that's familiar
it's Fallujah basically but there are
some differences women and children were
not bombed out of schreber nature as in
the Fallujah case but they were trucked
out and there will be no extensive
efforts we can assure that to exhume the
last possible course corpse of the pack
rats and their Warren's and Fallujah
there are other differences which are
arguably unfair to the Serbs well could
be argued that all this is irrelevant
the Nuremberg Tribunal spelling out the
UN Charter and declared that quoting at
initiation of a war of aggression is the
supreme international crime differing
only from other war crimes in that it
can
within itself the accumulated evil of
the whole hence the war crimes in
Fallujah great and so on these those
judged to have played any role in the
Supreme crime for example the German
Foreign Minister were sentenced to death
by hanging and the Tokyo tribunal it was
far more severe that is an important
book on this topic if you haven't read
it you should buy the canadian
international lawyer Michael Mandel who
reviews in unfortunately convincing
detail how the powerful have self
immunized become self immunized from
international law in fact the Nuremberg
Tribunal itself established this
principle of self immunity to bring the
Nazi criminals to justice it was
necessary to devise definitions of war
crime and crime against humanity they
hadn't existed precisely an
international law and how this was done
has explained candidly by Telford Taylor
who was the chief counsel for the
prosecution at Nuremberg and a
distinguished international lawyer and
historian so I'll quote him since both
sides in World War two had played the
terrible game of urban destruction the
Allies far more successfully there was
no basis for criminal charges against
Germans or in Japanese and in fact no
such charges were brought aerial
bombardment had been used so extensively
in ruthlessly on the Allied side as well
as the axis side that neither at
Nuremberg nor Tokyo was the issue who
made a part of the trials so in other
words goes on like this the operative
definition of crime is crime that you
committed and we did not and to
underscore that fact Nazi war criminals
were absolved if the defense could show
that their US counterparts carried out
the same crimes Taylor concludes from
this that to punish the foe especially
the vanquished foe
for conduct in which the enforcer nation
has engaged would be so grossly
inequitable as to discredit the laws
themselves which is correct but the
operative definition also discredits the
laws themselves along with all
subsequent tribunals which follow the
same principal Taylor provides this
background as part of his explanation of
why US bombing in Vietnam was not a war
crime and his argument is plausible
further discrediting the laws themselves
some of the subsequent tribunals are
discredited in perhaps even more extreme
ways such as the Yugoslavia versus NATO
case which is now being adjudicated by
the International Court of Justice World
Court the u.s. was excused correctly on
the basis of the argument that it is not
subject to the jurisdiction of the court
in this case the reason is that when the
United States signed the Genocide
Convention which is at issue here the
u.s. finally did sign it after 40 years
it signed it with a reservation saying
that it is inapplicable to the United
States and the rules of the World Court
say that they can only deal with
something if both sides are subjected to
its jurisdiction there was an outraged
comment on the efforts of the Justice
Department lawyers to demonstrate that
the president has the right to authorize
torture comment by the Dean of Yale Law
School Howard Koh and he said that the
notion that the president has the
constitutional power to permit torture
is like saying that he has the
constitutional power to commit genocide
well the president's legal advisers like
the new Attorney General should have
little difficulty arguing that the
president indeed does have that power if
the second super power us permits them
to exercise
