hi everybody
I'm Linda Sullivan wood I'm the editor
in chief of Canada's national observer
good evening hello if you're joining us
from the east good evening
if you're joining us from the West good
afternoon I'm so honored and thrilled
this evening to have no I'm Chomsky as
my guest and it's great to be here
together at home with all of you so
welcome our topic tonight is can we
emerge from code 19 with a new economy
and if so how well the usual class war
is operating right now
there are the people basically those who
call themselves the Masters of the
Universe who are already trying to plan
the future economy there's another group
the general population who are at the
moment more quiescent if that continues
then the first plan will be implemented
their plan is to reconstitute the
economy pretty much the way it's been
under the neoliberal period it's roughly
the last 40 years but harsher with more
controls over people more the means of
more authoritarian measures more efforts
to ensure that there's no interference
with this model we see that in many ways
I could run through them there's a good
opportunity to ask questions raise
questions about what kind of world we
want to live in do we want to live in a
very different world do we want to live
in a world where things like the
pandemic don't happen and remember that
although we're right now suffering from
the pandemic it's not the main crisis
why for
we can we will sooner or later escaped
from the pandemic at severe cost we are
not going to escape from the melting of
the polar ice caps of the rise in sea
level the other extremely harmful
consequences of global warming now the
ones who well it varies but the major
country in the world the most important
country the United States happens to be
in the hands of someone and in fact a
party that wants to exacerbate the
crisis wants to ensure that the coming
crisis which may well end the prospects
for organized human life but they want
to make sure that as severe as possible
and as imminent as possible and are
putting all their efforts into that
right as we speak can easily give
examples if we would every mother if we
want that to happen
we can watch and not react that Canada's
hardly blameless in this the there are
many other problems do we want to have a
world in which people have to live
paycheck to paycheck the United States
that's estimated maybe 60 or 70 percent
of the population that's the result of
policies of the past 40 years generally
called the neoliberal programs they are
designed so that wealth is very sharply
concentrated in very few hands the
United States happens to be somewhat
extreme but others are not all that
different in the United States before
the crisis 0.1 percent not 1% 0.1% of
the population at
about 20% of the country's wealth and
about 50% have negative net worth
liabilities greater than assets and can
barely get by if anything goes wrong
that's not a necessity those are
specific policies but those policies can
be changed fact it's not utopian to
think that we could do back to a period
before Reagan Thatcher and the rest in
which they were different and had
different consequences so for example if
you look at I don't know how much detail
you want but yes we can make a very
different world we can start doing it
right now
so for example there's a stimulus
program and the talk the Republican
Congress has passed so take a look at it
for example let's take something that
happened this morning and gives you a
good example the Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell who's really the guiding
hand he's a thinker of the
administration the real evil genius came
out and I've said that the stimulus
program cannot give many to states as he
played blue states it's not going to be
a blue state they'll have no money for
places like New York that vote
Democratic and the reason he said is
that we're not gonna the future
generations don't have to pay for the
mistakes that these states have made in
the past the mistakes are that they
granted pension plans for police and
firefighters and teachers and others and
if they want to waste their money that
way we're not going to pay for it
now let's look one inch away at the
stimulus plan
who are we giving money to enterprises
like say the airline industries which
have spent the last year gorging
themselves on super profits and using it
and not to benefit consumers not to
build up the industry but on stock
buybacks to raise profits for investors
and crucially for managers and CEOs how
much did they spend that way about forty
five billion dollars what are they
getting in the stimulus fifty billion
dollars so in other words if the rich
and powerful and corporate sector wanna
miss spend their money by enriching
themselves will pay off but if states
miss spend their money by giving
pensions to working people tough luck
we're not going to give it to you that's
the mentality of the administration it's
a level of sadism that is hard to
describe although it has very clear-cut
class basis you can see it very clearly
know if you want another illustration
just kind of telling now have a look at
the federal budget proposal that many
Trump administration submitted on
February 10th February 10th the pandemic
is raging that people are dying the
hospitals can't keep up the what's the
budget the budget proposal is to
continue the cuts in health related
parts of the government to cut back
further on the Center for Disease
Control Trump throughout his term has
been regularly cutting it back and in
the midst of the pandemic let's cut back
more let's not cut back everything let's
increase the subsidies to fossil fuel
industries our fossil fuel industry is
doing
undermining the prospect for organized
human life and of course let's have more
funding for the bloated military which
no ways most of the world and of course
for his famous wool not to keep those
rapists and murderers from coming across
the border when you live that's the
mentality of the administration which in
fact is just an extreme version of the
mentality of the Republican Party which
drifted off the rails years ago that's
so interesting
no I'm and when we were talking before
we got started tonight you said a couple
of things that really I think are
probably going to stay with me for the
rest of my life you said that I was
asking you about a tweet that I had a
headline I had seen where you said I
believe you said something like voting
for Trump would be worse than voting
like voting for Hitler or worse than
voting for Hitler and you just said back
to me that Trump is maximum what did she
said maximum sadism like worse than you
said he was worse than him oh I think
it's obvious and saying the three years
it's now become utterly transparent
let's take a look Hitler was maybe one
maybe the worst criminal in human
history he wanted to murder six million
Jews murdered my extended family 30
million Slavs homosexuals others that's
pretty evil the worst want to do he
wants to destroy the prospects for
organized human life all okay and in the
near future that's what it means to
maximize the use of fossil fuels to cut
back on all regulations that might
diminish restrict the danger in fact
let's take a look at the documentary
record probably the worst document that
we know of from the nazi year is the
declaration in 1942 where they basically
decided to kill all the Jews and conquer
conquer Eurasia and so on well let's
take the Trump administration the most
interesting document that's appeared
there which nearly was mentioned in the
press was about two years ago a document
produced by the National Transportation
Agency which was a long I think several
hundred page assessment of the
environmental situation and they
concluded that by the end of the century
global warming will reach four degrees
Celsius higher than pre-industrial
levels now that's taken to be
catastrophic by just about every analyst
and they drew a conclusion from the
conclusion was we should stop adding
emissions controls okay we should have
no emissions controls on automobiles and
the logic is sort of clear we're going
off the cliff anyway so I don't have fun
and make profit right how does that
compare with the lungs a declaration
with 1942 we see this in every action so
it's not just global warming but let's
kill more Americans now so for example
look right in the middle of this crisis
the Environmental Protection Agency
which is no subsidiary of the corporate
world used to be functioning scientists
have been thrown out silence
so they decided to relax eliminate
essentially controls on emissions from
coal plants and others that's in mercury
into the waterways pollute them kill
lots of children and so on
so let's extend that why put some more
dollars in their pocket okay that's the
deregulation goes on and on so they just
cut back the Obama administration
efforts to place limits on emissions
well that's just harming people in the
United States sorry to interrupt but you
you are one of the world's most renowned
and most respected social critics I
wonder like what advice you would have
for we're now up to 650 people on this
call like what advice do you have for
for us and for you know for all of us of
how to push back against the kinds of
things you're describing change change
the country's enormously we're not the
same as we were even 15 years okay we
can do this too so take the fossil fuel
industry take a look at the major the
United States candidate others could
simply socialize the industries by a
month not that expensive and put them
out of business there would be a great
boon to the world you can't do it in a
day which may be coming back on and
using profit
richard with the resources you have to
replace and buy sustainable energy how
much would that take they were carefully
an estimate it's been very good
economists about how much it would take
to how much what he cost to carry out
policies which will basically control
the enormous climate environmental
crisis you're not going to end it we've
already done too much damage but to keep
it within livable limits turns out it
would be a small percentage very small
percentage of the mobilization for World
War two and we're much richer countries
no so is that feasible
well it's feasible if I and this is only
one of the major problems we face there
are others which people aren't talking
about but are just as severe one of the
contributions of the Trump
administration to human life is to
dismantle the arms control regime which
is over some protection from terminal
nuclear war anyone who's looked at the
record will find that it's appalling
it's almost a miracle that we survive
talk about it at this time so I know it
Trump's decision is let's make it worse
so the last August
Trump dismantled the INF treaty which
was established by Reagan not a leftist
Reagan and Gorbachev reached
intermediate nuclear forces treaty in
1987 which has significantly reduced the
threat of nuclear war
Trump abandoned it and to make it clear
to the Russians or anyone else what he
meant
immediately after abandoning the treaty
within days he arranged to launch a
missile that violated the treaty
that's saying to mr. Putin please
develop weapons to destroy us and
that'll be great for the arms control in
just of the arms in the middle military
industry in fact if you look at their
pronouncements they'd love it they're
getting a huge shot in the arm enormous
money to build weapons that will be
destroyed everything and then down the
road they'll get more money to try to
build defenses against these weapons
that were encouraging others to produce
next on the chopping block
just announced couple of days ago is the
Open Skies treaty goes back eisenhower
another radical this Open Skies treaty
has again reduced the threat of
accidental nuclear war quite
significantly so let's get rid of that
next on the agenda last in fact is the
New START treaty that's its limits the
number of missiles and nuclear warheads
on for Russia and the United States
Putin not the most lovely guy in the
world I don't have to do anything that
has been pleading with the United States
to renegotiate the treaty it's too early
next year the US well Trump
administration won't do it the trick
that they're using to try to prevent it
is to say we want a broader treaty that
includes China that's a bad joke Chinese
nuclear facilities don't even come
anywhere near the minimal level of the
START treaty it was just a trick to use
the Yellow Peril hysteria to try to
prevent the signing of the New START
treaty when that's done we're done with
the arms control regime
how serious is that it's so serious it's
so serious and no and I have one more
question for you before I see
before I start asking you questions from
the the crowd we have a lot and we won't
be able to get to as many of them as we
would like but I'm I just wanted to you
know like draw you back to where we are
right now and ask you you have lived a
very long productive amazing life I'm
just what is it like for you to see
what's going on right now with the Cova
19 pandemic and how do you see the world
in this moment now as I speak or that
your mother's about my age and I suspect
it's the same memories I do it's all
bringing back memories of early
childhood the early thirties the early
thirties you could see the beginnings of
the rise of the fascist plague actually
the first article I remember writing was
in 1939 right after the fall of
Barcelona - Franco it was about the the
terrible shadow that's spreading over
the world seems inexorable first the
Nazis took Austria and then they took
Czechoslovakia now they've got Spain
where is it gonna end seems like they'd
taken over everything that's early
childhood memories there are others I
remember I don't want to waste time on
it but that's back at that point there
were two choices the world had to face
the Great Depression had an enormous
impact much worse than this effect and a
much poorer country and there were two
ways out one way was fascism spread over
the lot of the world another way was
basically New Deal style will first it's
tile lock receive liberalism
that was another way out that was the
way the United States took overcame
depression established
version of regimented capitalism which
was extremely beneficial to people it's
now being torn to shreds during the
neoliberal period but for a long time is
very effective those are the two way out
two's way is pleased though we're in the
same situation
not exactly won't be the same things but
we can either choose to make the world
harsher more brutal to march on to short
range destruction or we can overcome
these problems by means that are readily
available but as I said small percentage
of the funding for the second and second
world war mobilization small percentage
of that would be sufficient to get the
environmental crisis under control to
ensure that human life and many other
species can survive nuclear weapons
straight for no reason for them to exist
they can be cut sharply cut back in fact
eliminate okay we could go on with other
crises the economic crises that lead to
a world in which 0.1% of the population
holds twenty percent of the wealth and
the others struggled a bit by for a week
no reason for that to exist me not
exactly how to end in fact we've been
through ways of ending a choices I know
I'm I have so many questions and I see
that the one that's been voted up to the
top of the list is from Robert Hackett
and I just want to tell everybody even
though it's gotten so many votes up I'm
gonna go to the second question because
I feel it's such a good follow-up to
what we've been talking about already
and then I'm gonna get to Bob's question
this is from James Doyle
he says I'm 14 years old what do I do
take back my future well that's a very
good question and there's a very good
answer to it take a look at who's on the
front line to try to prevent the world
from being destroyed by the Trump types
young people take a look at the con
climate Strickland West October who very
significant a series of events who was
out there on the frontlines young people
take one of the most dramatic events in
my lifetime which I think ought to be
played in every classroom all over the
world but for the meaning of the Davos
conference in January the Davis
conference are the ones who in fact call
themselves the Masters of the Universe
of CEOs of major corporations big news
media executives commentators they get
together once a year and des Vosges to
Switzerland go swimming tell each other
how wonderful they are and so on the
meeting opened with two talks one after
the other
one was by Donald Trump the people that
they wasn't liking too much he's too
vulgar for them he drops their image of
humanism but they applauded him lustily
because there's one thing he knows that
they understand how to pour money into
the pockets of the very rich on the
portrait section so he got enormous
applause it was a crazy rant if you look
at it he was followed by a young girl
Britta Thunder seventeen-year-old girl
who gave a quiet factual speech accurate
careful describing the imminent crisis
eloquent as she ended quietly saying you
the people out there are destroying our
hope
she goes quiet clapping no not on the
head nice little girl go back to school
that that's the answer to your question
it's the Greta Thornburg's and the 14
year olds whose world is being destroyed
and they're on the front line of trying
to save it and the older generation is
betraying and they should we'll continue
to work energetically to make this clear
I stress again that that the videotape
of the opening of the meeting is a real
classic
okay thank you so much now this said
this question is from Robert Hackett who
writes for national Observer
greetings know when I interviewed you
for your national observer article last
year you presciently said that both
pandemics and climate change constituted
threats to organize human society but
you also said that mass social movements
could demand and mitigate climate change
do you feel that the pandemic makes
either of these outcomes extinction or
rebellion more likely what can we learn
from the pandemic about organizing for a
more climate-friendly economy that's
very important what we're seeing is many
things on the one extreme we're seeing
the Trump administration trying to
increase the severity of the pandemic I
didn't talk about it much but we could
on the other hand we see really heroic
people you know the doctors and nurses
on the front line
what they're doing is indescribable
they're trying to protect people survive
and help people survive under hideous
conditions but without protective gear
because the government's haven't given
it to them they've preferred to waste
their money elsewhere
four lines constantly all over the world
in China United States Canada everywhere
that's an indication of the magnificence
of the human spirit it's a model for
what can be done and there's much more
around much of the world including the
United States of mutual self-help groups
or organizing spontaneously communities
in which people just get together to try
to help those in need if food to elderly
people who are excluded you know help
people in trouble this is happening
everywhere
sometimes in almost spectacular ways the
most extreme that I know happens to be
in Brazil the favelas in Rio the slums
are miserable hopeless places you can't
ask people to watch frequently because I
don't have water they live you can't
sick sequester because they're all
packed into a small room the government
won't help they're like the United
States no we don't but there is a group
that's organizing to provide some help
for them no it is the crime gangs that
have been terrorizing the community they
are now getting together to try to help
people in the miserable slums to try to
survive this you see things like this
all over the world there's something
else happening on the international
level there is a progressive is the
Progressive International is being
formed that's the name to have its first
meeting in November it was initiated by
Bernie Sanders in the United States and
young Sparra wonderful economist
Treasury secretary in Europe he's the
founder of the organization the m25
Europe wide organization which is
working to try to salvage what makes
sense in the European Union to overcome
its deep flaws so they're calling for
the meeting of the Progressive
International which will bring together
activist groups around the world also
crucially bring in the global South
those who will suffer the worst from
this pandemic uh and what they're doing
is hoping to counter something that's
developing before our eyes and isn't
discussed very much a reactionary
international an international of the
most cruel the harsh reactionary states
organized from the White House which is
heading it including bolson ro in Brazil
who's described as nice even worse than
Trump doesn't do as much damage because
it's not at that powerful of country
he's in fact helping to destroy the
world by wiping out the Amazon which
will have an overwhelming effected
horrible people affected in the country
it's all flu it's not don't worry
restaurant so he's part of it moving to
the Middle East the occ dictatorship in
Egypt the worst dictatorship in Egypt's
history the family dictatorships of the
Gulf of the Gulf states brutal harsh
dictatorships Israel which has moved so
far to the right that you can't see it
anymore it's right in the center moving
further Modi's India Modi is working to
destroy demolish and then secular
democracy Institute a right-wing Hindu
nationalist virtual dictatorship crushed
at Rajesh mere in Europe bring in or
bonds
Hungary's turning Hungary from wiping
out Hungarians
bringing in turning it to a dictatorship
salvini and Italy gets his kicks out of
making sure that ships porches his
little group sink in the Mediterranean
killing people fleeing from characters
like that around the world
so Forge that into a international it's
happening right now the main to your
strategic program of the Trump
administration
so let's counter that with a progressive
international well can that be done and
if you look at the level of states they
see it seems totally out of balance you
look at the level of people that's not
true most people in the world want what
the progressive international stands for
so the question and the answer your
question is can they be mobilized to
take over I should say that the people
who own the world are worried about it
go back to that Davos conference I
mentioned was very interesting usually
every year is just self-congratulation
this year the mood was different the top
people there recognized that the
peasants are coming with the pitchforks
now we better do something about it so
the mood of the conference was let's
apologize for what we've been doing for
the last year's yes we did bad things we
armed people but we now understand so
we're now going to be the gentler more
humane there were probably concerned not
just with stockholders and executives
but communities and the workforce we're
really nice guys and trust your future
to us we'll take care of you that was
the mood at Davos and they didn't bother
telling us that we heard this tune
before so in the 1950s the tune was from
now on corporations are going to be what
was called soulful corporations
overflowing with human sentiments
wonderful lovely benefactors of the
human species
soulful corporations well we've seen
sixty years of to discover how souls
that they are but the point is they're
running scared they see what's happening
the prisons are coming with the
pitchforks that's so interesting I just
wanted to let you know that we have a
lot more questions I'm Dave Cuddy is
asking can you discuss any threats of
Blackrock The Wall Street investment
firm that claims to be going green yet
its invested heavily and fossil fuels
manages trillions of the global economy
how concerned should we be that the Bank
of Canada very recently appointed
Blackrock as its adviser for a new
quantitative easing program for
corporations how important is it to
lobby the Canadian government to cut its
ties with Blackrock well that's part of
the creating the image of social
corporations they're not doing it out of
love for the human race they're doing it
because they're being pressed to do it
they're under pressure to do it recently
there was a memo from JPMorgan Chase
biggest American bank saying we're under
reputational pressure what does that
mean means people are banging at our
doors and telling us we don't like what
we do
so we've probably better cut back on the
funding for fossil fuels okay you know
you can put one of the waste I mean
short of dismantling these institutions
which my view should be done but much
sort of that lots of pressure can be put
on them to turn them to become soulful
at least an image and improve things
[Music]
but that's what you're describing is an
indication of the significance of
constants popular pressures it's not a
lot of effect to give you an example for
example in the United States that take
the notion of a Korean New Deal some
version of green new deal is essential
for survival
although a couple of years ago is just
something to be ridiculed now it's in
the center of the legislature how did
that happen group small group called
sunrise movement group of young
activists young turn back to the first
question young activists were pressing
very hard to move this to Congress
whether they got to the point of sinning
in congressional offices they were
noticed they were backed by some of the
young congressional representatives who
swept came into office on the sanders
movement pressure especially an
Alexandria uh secret is they were joined
by Ed Markey senator from Massachusetts
has been interested in by our mental
issues now it's on the legislative
agenda you know laughing maybe it can be
pushed through we can survive this case
if the case okay
and we're familiar with it in the past I
mean take a look at the United States in
1960 okay it was a one of the freest
countries in the world it also had
anti-miscegenation laws which were so
extreme that the Nazis refused to adopt
it had federal laws requiring that
govern federally government subsequent
supported housing had to be segregated
women were still legally treated under
the initial laws of the founding of the
country they took over from Britain in
which women were technically property
not persons handed from the father to
the husband it had been eroded somewhat
over the years but it wasn't until 1975
after the pressure of the women's
movement that women were legally
recognized to be peers they had a right
to serve on federal jurors we can go on
and on country has changed enormously
Canada too didn't happen by magic was
not a gift from social corporations or
benign government it came from extensive
popular mobilization and action which
can change things and has in the past in
many ways we're a much more civilized
world thank you so much
I'm we have so many good questions here
I'm mr. Chomsky do you think the post
covered 19 pandemic will create a more
positive economical and social global
world or will it continue to be a
downward spiral that's whoever the
questioner is that's up to you the
choices are there just as in the early
to 30s the choices were between fascism
and liberal social democracy there are
those who are going to be struggling
consciously to make it just a
continuation of the neoliberal world
with harsher texture there will be
others like you who will be trying to
change it in another direction
the ones who for example will be meeting
the ones who carried out the climate
strike let's talk to the ones we were
working constantly to make black rock
shift its policies to make TV
Morgan Chase cut back on fossil fuel
from you
what world will come out depends on the
balance of forces thank you this
question is from Maxine Kaufman la
Cousteau Maxine asks you mentioned clean
energy but after viewing the recent
documentary planet of the humans which
convincingly argued that the fossil
fuels required to produce short live
solar panels and wind turbines and for
backup to these technologies equal or
exceed which use currently from burning
coal oil gas have we been misled by the
environmental NGOs what's your view on
this yeah I think the question is I'm
clean energy is it kind of a are we
being duped that the clean energy like
solar panels and wind turbines is
actually clean because a documentary
called planet of the humans convincingly
argued that it's equivalent to burning
coal oil and gas I think I got that
right Maxine you're on the chat of the
phones and turbines is equivalent to
burning folks are near oil you have
burning fossils yeah so we had a slide
couldn't have convincingly argued that
because it's not even remotely true I
mean there are costs to solar balance
like you have to dispose of them so you
have to manufacture but that's not even
remotely in the domain of what happens
with the use of fossil and it simply
suggest to the questioners to look into
the details of the matter more closely
apparently Bill McKibben wrote an
article debunking that so maybe that's
something the questioner could refer to
no I'm who has written widely sorry who
has written
Leon what a sustainable economy would
look like is it even possible a
sustainable economy a lot of interesting
work - Robert :
economy very good economists
occasionally has written extensively in
great detail about how to develop a
sustainable economy which would also
ensure that those who are losing their
jobs as the fossil fuel industry goes
out of existence will in fact have ways
of being integrated successfully into
the new economy and he also points out
that'll be a much more livable economy
it isn't much fun to spend maybe many
hours a week with sitting in traffic
jams be much easier to have be much
pleasanter life of a decent mass
transportation system instead of having
a huge electric bills we could pay
almost nothing like I do have solar
panels there are many ways to make the
world a much more pleasant to live in
and not to be destroying with fossil
fuels
Pollan as elaborated this in detail
Robert all incorrect Robert Pollin in a
lot of people are asking predict he's
the economist at the University
Massachusetts great another one is
Jeffrey Sachs very good economist - is
it Columbia runs the Earth Sciences
Institute he's written extensively on as
a very long careful article in the
journal American Prospect
it's er next coverage sorry it is within
reason to do thank you and this question
is from Senator Rosa Galvez she asks
what are the three most critical changes
that we have to apply to hyper
capitalism to induce major shift for
example to a circular economy or to
decrease growth and there was a
follow-up to that question so I'm just
going to ask you that as well from
Annabel white what would the world
become if the institution the
institution of global finance totally
collapsed to do what what would the
world become a glue if the institution
of global finance totally collapsed so
there I just gave you four questions the
last words if global what collapses
finance the global economy collapses
collapses well there's no reason for the
global economy could collapse with
rotten policies on the part of
governments but there's certainly no
reason for it I mean actually we've been
through worse pandemics than this take a
look at what's called the Spanish clues
flu century code was far worse than this
and in a much poorer country and there
were no means that nobody knew at the
time out of control did we did
everything disappear Kaname is recovered
far worse and now we're in much better
shape to deal with it what are they I
don't know if I can mention three things
but there are a lot of things that can
be done to overcome the immediate thief
not only the immediate crisis but the
causes of let's take a look
I'll use the United States as the
example for two reasons one I know more
about it and secondly
important country so right now there's a
big stimulus building given almost no
surveillance who knows it's going to go
to we know they'll go to the rich
corporate sector and so on does it have
to be let's take the airline industry
which I'm a tricked I suppose we decide
to bail them out for their having spent
the last years enriching themselves with
stock bill buybacks instead of building
up the under present suppose we decide
okay we'll do it anyway it can be done
with conditionalities okay saying you
wanted some money from the government
you have to commit yourselves to never
carry out stipe of stock buybacks to
never put your money in tax havens which
Rob's the public of tens of trillions of
dollars to put workers on the management
board
let's have ensure a livable wage for all
your workers to pay some attention to
the needs of passengers instead of
investors and CEOs we can put all of
those conditionalities on you don't want
to make them get lost
we'll just take over the industry things
like that is that utopian incidentally
not not least before Reagan all of this
was law not it was implemented it's not
utopian to say let's go back to the law
as it was implemented before the name of
the rule of souls not news can we go
beyond that
sure can let's take think for a moment
about the origins of this pandemic what
why did has ever happened and you go
back to 2003 SARS epidemic scientists
all over knew that it's very likely that
another Carano virus epidemic is coming
now they knew how to prepare for it but
it didn't happen why knowledge isn't
enough you have to have the
institutional structure so who could
have worked out well there's
company's enormous resources we pour
money into their pockets by
protectionist measures like incredible
patent protection which is what's called
intellectual property rights huge gift
to enrich the drug company so there are
overflowing with money that we've given
them they have a lot of resources could
they take this up no because of
something called capitalism which says
that what you're supposed to do is
follow market signals ok market signals
or you're not going to make any profit
out of this you don't make profit out of
preventing a catastrophe a couple of
years down the road that you make profit
by selling something tomorrow so they're
out because of capitalist logic then
comes the second question why doesn't
the government step in so when I was a
kid when your mother was a kid one of
the terrors of the world was polio was a
real terror I remember it was overcome
by a government funded program which led
to the sole crack scene which had no
patents socks had not slept the son of
giving it away well why not do that
because of the neoliberal plague which
says the government's not allowed to
help remember Ronald Reagan government's
the problem not the solution
it's corporations that are solution of
course the government is the solution
when they're in trouble and we bail them
out and subsidize it well in the
populations in trouble government is not
the solution
ok that's the second part of the hammer
neither of those is necessary they can
all be eliminated ok easily easy to
think through the measures and we can go
on we can change the institutional
structures that are driving us to
disaster it's all within reach no I'm
that's great note I cannot believe it
but are we've already come to the end of
our hour that just flew by it's you
it's so amazing to hear what you have to
say what you're thinking about things
and I just want to thank you so much for
your time and your expertise and I wanna
thank everybody for coming tonight and
today if you're out here in the West and
stay safe stay healthy see you next time
good very good to be with you
