you were asked about the chances of
Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic
nomination and your view your outlook
was quite pessimistic so I just want to
show our audience what your answer was
and then follow up with you on what you
think today let's take a quick look if
he gets the nomination the attacks will
be wild I will get the whole Republican
propaganda machine going after this
Jewish atheist you know wants to kill
all the whites
no no no chances he could be elected or
pretty small but if he does get elected
miracle he won't have Congress how you
gonna win Congress the Congress is that
the u.s. electoral system is
structurally constructed so that the
reactionary elements have an
overwhelming advantage so you described
the chances of Bernie Sanders winning
the election as a miracle but if it does
happen there are structural issues in
place that would prevent him from
carrying out his agenda now this is an
issue that's been brought up by everyone
regardless of political ideology and so
you know Bernie Sanders is answer to
that has always been well it's about the
people it's about empowering the
electorate so they demand more so they
fight they go to the states where these
members of Congress deny the policies
that they that the people want and we
can accomplish things if we mobilize and
organize now I have two questions for
you number one do you still believe that
it would be a miracle for Bernie Sanders
to get elected I think miracle may be
too strong but it would be a very
difficult test I mean the the the
liberal media attacks on Sanders are
already shocking as one of the
Washington Post just a couple days ago
that amazed me once the Republicans get
started leaving worse now it might be
with enough possible there's another
part of that interview which
didn't play which said that the great
advantage that Bernie Sanders has is
that he does have a popular base which
he's inspired which is active which was
motorized and this goes back to your
point a minute ago about the great
achievements of the struggles in the
labor movement they were indeed
significant it wouldn't have been a New
Deal hadn't been for CIA or organizing
sit-down strikes and so on but that's
one part of the story the other part of
the story was that there was a
moderately sympathetic administration
labor historian Eric Loomis has who's
written a lot about very interestingly
about strikes and labor activism and
their achievement it points out that if
you look at the whole record the
achievements of labor struggles have
always been in the case when there was
at least a mildly sympathetic responsive
power system then they could achieve
something otherwise they're crushed so
you need both it's with Bernie Sanders
in office there would be a sympathetic
administration even if he didn't have
Congress within his hands and at that
point if serious popular struggles labor
struggles and women's struggles and
others did develop there would be a
positive supportive reaction and that
amalgam can lead to change that gets
back to what we're talking about before
there is a decision to be made on in
November or in the primaries and the
desync the decisions a simple one
shouldn't take a lot of attentions and
it's pretty obvious where it should be
so make it and then go back to work
developing read the popular struggle
that will have to be the
major part of this effort is to make a
change as I understand
Sanders she's pretty much reasoning I
think that one of the biggest
misconceptions is that if you just elect
the right President to represent you
that would lead to the change that the
people need but you need that
sympathetic person in the White House
and then that's when the struggle really
begins that's when you need to mobilize
and get politically active and demand
more in order to really change the
system so it benefits the working class
as opposed to those at the very top
