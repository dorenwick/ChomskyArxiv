all we hear are uh these people are
trying to get into our country this is a
these threats are coming from all over
the place why are they coming where are
they coming from uh so uh we want this
really to be like a discussion like very
organic and but uh I'd like to leave it
at that part and maybe have uh Professor
chumsky if you if you like to talk about
neoliberal policies and you know stuff
like that
well my main contribution to this issue
is to have two daughters uh one of whom
AI who you mentioned is one of the
leading Specialists on this topic in
fact he just came back from a couple of
weeks in Arizona with the students at
the college where she teaches Salem
State and others uh doing border border
monitoring uh uh legal work and nales
were a lot of immigrants are people who
are caught on this side of the Border
are put into what amounts to cattle cars
and trucked through nagales and dumped
in Mexico on the Mexican side there's
things called court cases but it's kind
of like military commissions you know
doesn't count as a court case uh and
another daughter who just decided he
used who was a brown student
incidentally and after uh graduating and
working at the American math Society for
a while uh decided she wanted to live
like a third world woman so she went
down to Nicaragua and she's been living
there works for
oxman husband two
kids uh so guess they're on the other
side um uh Cave mentioned that most of
this started in the early '90s
and there's a reason why it started in
the early 90s in fact 1994 the year when
Clinton initiated operation gatekeeper
militarizing the Border was the same
year that NAFTA
passed uh and it was understood that
uh by here that the effect of NAFTA
would be to undermine Mexican
agriculture which may be efficient but
it can't compete with the U the US Agra
business that gets a large percentage of
its profits from State subsidies thanks
to Ronald Reagan and other free market
Apostles so it's going to undermine
Mexican agriculture it's going to drive
people off the land and they also
understood that Mexican
businesses uh cannot compete with us uh
corporations huge us corporations which
are allowed to which are granted the
right of what's called National
treatment in Mexico
so if say General Motors invests in
Mexico they are entitled to claim the
same treatment as a Mexican company now
that's a right that holds only for
corporations not for people if a Mexican
manages to come to New York and asks for
National
treatment if he's lucky he won't be in
Guantanamo but these are special rights
granted to corporations among the many
that are granted to corporations well
above those that human beings have and
NAFTA enshrined a lot of them they're
also in the World Trade Organization
rules and in the whole so-called you
liberal
framework well uh there's another Factor
uh throughout the
1980s the US was carrying out murderous
terrorist Wars all through Central
America a lot of the people who are
coming are indigenous people from
farther south um Guatemala Salvador
these places were devastated hundreds of
thousands people were
killed all kind of torture and Terror
was almost all due to there have been
truth commissions almost all uh the
responsibility of the US Run State
terrorist forces or in the case of
Nicaragua Contra Army just a mercenary
Force so the and in in some areas like
say the Guatemalan Highlands Mayan areas
it was real genocide you know I total
devastation actually there are Mayan
communities
around here they keep kind of quiet
because uh uh as undocumented immigrants
do and also around U not too well near
where my daughter lives she's working
with Mayan groups that are up there well
these people were started to were
fleeing from disasters part of it was
just the terrorist disaster of Reagan's
Wars part of it is the neoliberal
disaster that is the imposition of
certain kind of economic
regime uh um which required cut back in
state
Services cut back in services for the
poor and you know local development and
so on and acceptance of uh uh what's
called opening up which means you give
up to the highest the biggest power so
like us Agro business or us
manufacturers who turn parts of Mexico
into assembly plants from which Mexico
gets very little but uh it's good for
the corporations it's terrible for
American workers uh but that's not one
of the goals of policy I mean American
in the United
States for a majority of the population
real wages have pretty much stagnated
for about 30 years that's the neoliberal
period during the period of
financialization of the economy here and
the hollowing out of production uh which
means you don't stop production but it's
just done elsewhere you know like Mexico
China Vietnam uh that's fine for the
banks and it's great for the owners and
stockholders but it's terrible for the
population here and it's much worse for
the population in Mexico in fact NAFTA
is one of those rare treaties maybe the
only one which has actually harmed the
majority of the population in all three
participating countries Canada the
United States and Mexico and of course
go worst and in addition to that comes
the the tretis of the American wars in
Central America all trying to flee uh
the timing of the U militarization of
the border is not accidental and uh
American planner incidentally the
American population was opposed to NAFTA
uh so were the Canadians Mexico we don't
have very good evidence but it looks
like Mexicans were opposed too so this
was not an agreement at least Le if
people are part of their countries it's
called the North American Free Trade
Agreement I the only accurate words in
that phrase are North American it was in
Mexico United States and Canada it
wasn't an agreement if people are part
of their countries because they were
opposed and it certainly wasn't a free
trade agreement it has highly
protectionist elements and a lot of it
isn't about trade at all like for
example granting National treatment to
us corporations has nothing to do with
trade
uh trade is put in there so you can sort
of sell it and free is put in there to
make it sound good uh but it's uh it's a
an agreement uh designed in the interest
of the people who designed it it's not a
great surprise it was designed by
multinational corporations and the few
States Harris in particular that
primarily cater to their interests and
sure so they're doing fine after all
it's their treaty uh but the population
is not and there's abely nothing new
about this I mean these are truisms it
goes back to the origin origins of
industrialization fact you can read
about this in Adam Smith you know we're
supposed to worship Adam Smith but
you're not supposed to read him it's too
dangerous dangerous radical I one of the
things he pointed out is that uh and he
was concerned with England he said then
England in his day 1776 this is Wealth
of Nations uh what he call the principal
architects of policy are the merchants
and manufacturers of England and they
Institute policies uh which make sure
that their interests are well uh catered
to however Grievous the effect on others
including the population of England
that's not their concern uh and of
course even worse uh what he called The
Savage Injustice of the British in India
he's an old-fashioned conservative who
had moral values you'd have to be a
diogenes to find one today but he was a
real old-fashioned conservative he had
moral values and he could see Elementary
truths like the fact that policy is
designed by those who concentrate
economic power in their hands and they
design policy for their own good no
matter what happens to others that's
secondary well things haven't changed
that much since
1776 and now these views are called you
know radical or Marxist or some other
bad word but they're just truisms I mean
in a free country you'd learn an
elementary school in fact how else could
it work you know it be amazing if it
didn't work that way and uh NAFTA is a
perfectly good example it was designed
by now it doesn't happen the EM
merchants and manufacturers it's you
know financial institutions and
multinational corporations but the logic
is pretty much the same uh what happens
to the population is uh what's called in
economics courses an externality if
you've taken an economics course you
know
that there when you make a transaction
you know you buy a car or something the
participants in a transaction according
to economic theory uh look out for their
own interests and then they're kind of
like side effects what happens to other
people that's a footnote that's called
an externality well you know the
externalities can be pretty large like
say The Current financial crisis is an
externality uh when Goldman Sachs and
you know
AIG and so on make transactions they
look out for their own benefit they
don't pay attention to what's called
systemic risk the risk that the whole
thing's going to collapse and they're
right not to do that because then since
they are the Masters pretty much run the
government they can count on the
government to ensure that the taxpayer
bails them out so they should make uh
risky U Investments and Loans cuz they
got a insurance policy from you uh so
yeah that's the way the do it and there
are other externalities which are even
worse of course the people of Mexico and
Guatemala and El Salvador and the United
States their fate is an externality but
so is the fate of our
grandchildren for example if you take a
look today's polls you last couple of
days there are new polls on attitudes of
Americans towards global warming and it
keeps going down by now about a third of
the population think that believe in
anthropogenic global warming humans have
something to do with global warming uh
it's it's being relentlessly driven down
by a massive propaganda barrage telling
people it's all liberal hoax so forget
about it now you know the guys who are
running these campaigns know perfectly
well that the liberal hoax is very real
and it could destroy the lives of their
grandchildren in fact could destroy
everything they own and in their
personal lives you know decent human
beings they understand that but in their
institutional lives as uh say Executives
of a corporation they have to play an
Institutional role the institutional
role is maximize profit and market share
in fact that's a legal requirement and
ignore the externalities well in this
case the externality happens to be the
survival of the species but the logic is
the same the same as systemic risk the
same as uh Adam Smith's Grievous effects
on the population of England these are
inherent properties of Market systems uh
and uh you call them inefficiencies if
you like but U they're massive well
NAFTA had these effects as
anticipated forms began in Mexico in the
1980s uh they were the result of
policies and actually what what happened
is the the World Bank and the US
Treasury and others had been through the
70s been trying to you know induce you
know demand demand or insist that third
world countries uh borrow like mad from
us lend lenders so they were
tremendously these are usually third
world dictators that did what they were
told so they should borrow from US Banks
and they did they were hugely in debt uh
American Banks were wildly Overexposed
to debt like City Group which is
collapsing now or also collapsed in
1981 uh and was bailed out by your
parents uh that's the way the system
works the uh uh the the debt
crashed uh when Reagan came in actually
Carter late Carter early Reagan and Paul
fulker you know who fed um had uh raised
interest rates very high to wipe out
inflation in the American economy well
us went into a deep recession it's
Reagan recession but it pulled out it's
a rich country uh on the other hand
third world countries couldn't their
their debts were indexed to us uh
inflation so as uh to the US dollar as
it went down they got huge debts which
they couldn't pay uh the punishment for
that was what we called structural
adjustment
programs uh in the United States if the
rich guys crash the economy
we bail them out but in the poor
countries if the rich guys crash the
economy the poor bail them out it's
called a structural adjustment program
uh meaning you stop Public Services you
know you you cut back on support for
agriculture you put all your money into
paying debts and so on in fact the
prescriptions for the poor countries are
the exact opposite of the prescriptions
for the rich countries here when you
have a recession the government produces
a big stimulus you know it bails out the
bankers and so on and so forth poor
country is the opposite you pay off your
debts you cut back production uh you cut
back services and you suffer that's how
you pay it off the poor people the mass
of the population didn't they didn't uh
the debts were not owned by them you
know they didn't have anything to do
with the debts the debts were incurred
by their wealthy rulers but the poor pay
it off it's a racket the racket is known
as the international monetary fund the
executive director of it an American was
honest enough to describe it as the
credit communities
enforcer meaning if Rich Banks here make
Loans To Third World dictators and they
can't pay them back then the poor in the
country that borrowed pay our creditors
here and incidentally so so does a North
American taxpayer they pay off the banks
to make sure that
uh you know they're doing fine it's just
what's happening before our eyes it
keeps happening regularly it's built
into the system uh it's notice that this
is exactly the opposite of what a
capitalist economy would be and there's
a lot of talk about capitalism which is
mostly a joke I mean in a capitalist
economy if I lend you money and you know
that and I know that it's risky you know
so I'll lend it at a high interest rate
because it might go sour
so I make a lot of money for the
interest and if it turns out at some
point that you can't pay that's my
problem not in the international scene
if a city group makes a loan to Mexico
and knows it's risky so they high
interest rates they get a ton of profit
and then it
crashes doesn't work like a capitalist
system they don't pay for it they don't
suffer for it the American taxpayer
bails them out and the poor in the poor
countries
have to pay off uh the debt by
structural adjustment programs so Mexico
was every country that's been subjected
to these neoliberal rules including even
us has uh suffered from it like growth
radically declined other macroeconomic
measures declined and pretty obvious why
but the rich did fine just like here you
know we're kind of like a microcosm of
it we're such a rich country it doesn't
have the same effects but it's basically
the same structure well okay here you
have a bunch of attacks on the country
South of the Border the neoliberal
programs uh the terrorist Wars uh you
know the the flooding of their uh
productive apparatus by subsidized us uh
uh Agro business by major US
corporations they can't compete with
well the obvious effect is there's going
to be a a flow of people from the uh
devastated countries to the rich country
uh which is responsible for it so that's
illegal immigration uh up until the
early '90s the Border uh was pretty open
it was poorest border same people lived
on both sides they crossed the border to
visit their families and that sort of
thing like other borders it was based on
Conquest the United States just
conquered half of Mexico what we call
the Southwest is Mexico that's why the
city names you know San Francisco
Angeles are all Spanish names yeah it
was Mexico we conquered it and uh uh it
was in pretty open border but once it
was clear to the Clinton Administration
that there's going to be a flood of
people coming as a result of the
policies they're imposing they
militarized the Border that's why it
starts in the early 90s and it's gotten
harsher and harsher as the effects get
worse and worse the punishment gets
harsher and harsher and it has an
internal effect here it's a way of
disciplining the domestic population so
I don't have to tell you there's huge
propaganda here to get people to blame
their plight on illegal immigrants you
know if I don't have a job and like my
wages have stagnated for 30 years
because the Liberals are giving
everything away to the illegal
immigrants now you want to hear this
just listen to Rush limbo you know Glenn
Beck Sarah palen tea parties it's a good
way of uh making sure that the people
who you're smashing in the face don't do
anything about it and blame someone else
like the Nazis blame the Jews you know
okay we blame the illegal immigrants and
the blacks they're the ones who are
responsible for what we're suffering so
it's a way of controlling and
disciplining this population too and
it's not that they didn't know what they
were doing they knew exactly what they
were doing you go back to the top
planning uh around 1990 you know at that
time and the government government for
example there was a Latin American
strategy Workshop in the Pentagon in
1990 where they were looking over the
long-term consequences actually of us
Mexico relations and they decided that
us Mexico relations were great it's true
that Mexico is full of torture and
starvation and these insignificant
things but relations were great but they
noticed One Cloud on The Horizon the
cloud was what they called a democracy
opening in Mexico there might be a
democracy opening in Mexico which would
uh threaten the domination of US
economic and political power over Mexico
so you had to stop a democracy opening
well one way to do it was
NAFTA uh that in fact it was understood
that NAFTA I'm quoting now would lock
Mexico into the
reforms term reform doesn't mean reform
it means you know doing things our way
that's called a reform so uh it would
lock Mexico into the neoliberal programs
by a treaty so if the danger there was a
democracy opening took place there
wouldn't be anything they could do about
it because it' be locked in by treaty
okay that's NAFTA you lock the programs
in by treaty and then if a dangerous
democracy opening takes place while
we're kind of protected from it this is
the open thinking it's perfectly
sensible it's uh just Adam Smith's
truisms applied to the current period
and it shows up in all kind of ways I
mean one of the interesting ways it
shows up is in American law I mean you
know you've when you were at Junior High
School you read the amendments to the
Constitution there is an amendment
called the 14th Amendment which says
that no person shall be deprived of
Rights without due process okay no
person well that's no good and the
courts have since changed that law in
two ways for one thing they ex they both
expanded and restricted the notion of
person so over the late 19th century and
primarily about a century ago uh
corporations were given the rights of
persons uh
this uh infuriated conservatives because
there was a direct attack on the
principles of Classical liberalism which
holds that rights inherent persons not
legal fictions that are constructed by
government uh laws but corporations were
given the rights of persons and slowly
that meant freedom of speech freedom
from Asser seizure you know on and on
and then when you get to the trade
agreements they get rights Way Beyond
persons as I mentioned so that's one way
in which the notion of person was
changed in fact the fort courts that
when the courts dealt with 14th
Amendment cases was almost all for
corporations I the intent of the people
who initiated it was for slaves to be
protected by it but they're poor and
weak and so on so they had no way of
appealing but corporations are big and
strong so they did and the courts
gradually Incorporated them into the
notion of person and now it goes Way
Beyond uh just last January the courts
uh Supreme Court uh gave corporations
the rights to buy elections you know
pretty open so you can buy elections
because your persons persons have
freedom of speech and money of speech so
you want to buy election go ahead and do
it so that's one change in the notion
person the other change is what do you
do about people like uh
undocumented uh aliens well okay the
courts have decided over the years that
they are not persons look literally so
these people are being picked up by the
border control Patrol uh stuck in cattle
cars if they make it alive and ship back
across the border they're not uh uh
under the jurisdiction of the 14th
Amendment because they're not persons
and in fact if you look at what's going
on in
Congress the two political parties are
sort of competing with each other to see
which one can be more Savage in denying
right
to these non-persons who happen to be
here without papers and all of this goes
on at the same time that the courts and
much of Congress is granting more rights
to General Motors and General Electric
and the Goldman Sachs and so on because
they are persons in fact super persons
well that's our legal system and uh you
know nobody talks about it because
that's the way power is supposed to
operate and you're not supposed to know
about it you're not supposed to be able
to read the words of the 14th Amendment
because that's too scary you know so
people can scream about taking our
constitution away from us but they're
not talking about this these are real
things and it's playing out in human
lives the way you're describing uh very
brutally in fact and it's uh this new
law that's coming through is a real
Horror in fact the law that's coming
through uh criminalizes everybody in
Arizona who looks as if they might be
Latino I mean they can have been born
here their parents can born here they
have to walk around with documents all
the time I mean just think how you'd
feel if you had to walk around with
documents all the time proving you're a
citizen you know you you have to have
them because the police have the right
to stop you if they think you might not
be Pure White they have a right to stop
you and demand that you give proof of
citizenship and if you don't have to
have it on you uh you can be sentenced
and furthermore other citizens you know
the
blue-eyed uh blond ones if they see
somebody walking down the street and a
police who looks Latino and a policeman
doesn't stop them they can sue the
police for not stopping them and
demanding their citizenship so this
essentially criminalizes substantial
part of the population in fact the part
that comes from the country which we
conquered you know uh we conquered it
and took it and there's a lot of people
there
who what we call Latino in the
background okay they're criminalized and
as you said this can easily extend
beyond in fact under Obama it's gotten
much worse I mean the number of raids on
to toss out uh uh undocumented
immigrants has increased pretty sharply
under Obama in fact about a week or two
ago there a big Federal operation which
uh I think the biggest one ever which
caught a huge number of lot of planning
caught a huge number of undocumented
aliens and ship them across the border I
mean these can be people who've lived
here since childhood who have you know
families jobs doesn't matter they're not
persons so we do what we want to them
well that's if we accept it that's the
society we live in
wanted to thank Professor ksky for for
kind of Illuminating a bit of the
background as to why we're seeing the
Border look the way it does now um and
some of the the economic policies and
also the political decisions that have
been influencing that um and so we're
kind of hoping to have a bit of a
conversation now about um what is
happening on the border how those
broader economic and political decisions
are as youly put it you know playing out
in in human lives um and to kind of
describe a bit more about the work that
um the work that we're doing and what
we're seeing on the ground and um how
this all kind of relates and so we're
hoping to kind of open it up for
questions um but before we did that I
actually wanted to talk a little bit
about some of the abuse documentation
work that nust does um because that is
what Avi Chomsky was um doing actually
over spring break no more dust runs an
alternative spring break program we also
um operate camps out in the desert for
four months um out of the summer um when
the the heat often goes over 110 degrees
during the day um and the abuse
documentation work is is where
increasingly we're seeing a lot of these
um patterns um in terms of what's
happening with the raids and also
hearing the stories of the abuses um
that are happening in detention
facilities and in short-term custody
with border patrol um so volunteers with
nust and with a lot of other
organizations um will take you know when
people are deported they come back over
the Border a lot of times at night um
they'll you know have a medical care
available to them um food a phone call
home to maybe tell their family what
happened um and it used to be more so
that a lot of the stories that uh
volunteers were hearing from migrants
that were being deported were um the
stories of you know subsistent uh
farming that was pretty much undercut by
these broader policies um people that
had that had lost everything and had no
choice but to come north um to try to
take care of their families and
increasingly now uh with the abuse
documentation work we're hearing more
stories of long-term residents um that
have been living people that have lived
in the US for 10 11 15 20 30 years maybe
their entire lives um aside from when
they were little kids and they came over
with their their parents who have been
picked up in either these ice raids or
they have been reported to ice um by
employers you know if they're asking for
a um an increase in their wages or
something like that um are caught up in
the criminal system and are being
deported through some of the the
subtleties of immigration law in the US
um that are reporting also I mean that's
that's one element of it so profiles um
where we're hearing a lot of stories of
families that are being broken up that
are being completely sped apart and
people that are trying to get back into
the US um to to to reunite with with
their their spouses and their children
and their jobs um and and their
communities but we're also hearing a lot
more stories of extreme abuse at the
hand of border patrol officials and uh
people in these detention facilities as
well um so there's a lot of stories uh
that even came out of the the spring
break just recently um of border patrol
officers uh breaking bones of of people
that they um Encounter of of pushing
people into Cactus um that they you know
that they encounter in the desert of um
psychological uh torture in terms of say
you're you're picked up and it's very
very hot out there often um and then
you're put into a truck crowded with a
group of other people and then the AC is
turned on you're already dehydrated and
what that does to your system um people
being forced to sign documents um that
aren't translated for them and and
signing against their will having their
possessions thrown away in front of them
um and so that's another element that
we're hearing um that kind of is is
changing this Dynamic too along of
what's happening on the border but also
what's happening in communities
domestically how families are being
broken apart um how people are trying to
get back in to see their family and how
border militarization is is playing a
part in that so I just kind of wanted to
describe a little bit about that because
that's another element besides the death
pole um which by all accounts is is
largely inaccurate because um a lot of
people that go missing are never found
um but there's also these extremely
severe abuses um that are happening to
people as as well that are crossing in
and and being picked up well most of
this is for you but just one comment on
the incarceration the incarceration is a
neol liberal phenomenon if you go back
to the 1970s before the neoliberal
programs were instituted here the prison
the rate of incarceration in the United
States was approximately the same as
Europe a little bit on the high end but
pretty much the same and a crime in the
United States is pretty much the same as
other industrial countries actually
there's one exception in the United
States homicides with guns but that's
because of the craz guns gun laws but if
you take that away you know you look at
the rest of crime it's approximately
like other comparable countries and the
prison rate was too now the prison rate
is about 5 to 10 times as high as other
comparable countries not because of more
crime this is a way of getting rid of
the Superfluous
population uh it's mostly black or Or
Hispanic mostly men uh and if you look
at the history of African-Americans in
the and the reason was that as the
economy started becoming
financialized and you know production
gets hollowed out there just aren't jobs
for these people they're Superfluous I
mean in one of our dependencies like
Colombia uh the way they handle it is by
what's called social cleansing you send
out the military and the paramilitary
and you murder them okay we're more
civilized so we throw them into prison
uh but the the PO the incarceration rate
has risen steadily from the late Carter
years through Reagan through Clinton
right up till today uh as the uh
neoliberal programs have have proceeded
so yeah that's another aspect of it and
in fact uh if you take a look at the
history of African-Americans in the
United States I mean we all know that
there was slavery until the Civil War
what very few people know is that
slavery was reinstituted after the Civil
War by
criminalization there was a compact
between the North and the South in 18
1977 after reconstruction was ended
which essentially allowed the South to
criminalize black life
literally some black guy is standing on
a street corner you can arrest him for
vagrancy he looks the wrong way or
somebody claims he looks the wrong way
at a white woman you can arrest him for
attempted rape you know the the charge
may be $10 but the system set up so he's
in there for life he has to pay the
corrupt judge and you the lawyer and he
doesn't have it so they're in there for
life and they became a slave labor force
in fact a lot of the US Industrial
Revolution is based on slave labor from
criminals uh in the South what are
called criminals in the South like us
steel would go down there and you
terrific labor force the state gives you
the workforce free you don't have to pay
any attention to them you if they die
you get more it's an endless supply of
cheap labor and much of the American
industrial uh Revolution you know steel
mines and so on comes out of that well
that went on until the second world war
the second world war you needed free
labor for War Industry so it ended and
there was a black migration to the north
and there were jobs because people had
to go into War Industry a huge increase
in production and that persisted through
the post-war period there was a kind of
a post-war boom you know when through
the ' 50s and 60s uh when say a black uh
man could get say a job in an auto plant
and get a pretty decent life you know
buy a house and get a car and so on well
by the 70s that was over uh policies
changed uh now we direct policies
towards Financial enriching financial
institutions and stopping productive
labor here well what do you do with
those people stick them back in jail
where they in fact again you used for
labor forc labor uh you look at the
whole history of
African-Americans in the United States
is a couple of decades in which there
was some sort of relative freedom but
that talk about the Border that's so if
for example if this bill passes it's
very likely that the rest of the country
could see repercussions because it's
it's succeeding in Arizona we tend to
get like the harshest laws pass um
another example for another example of
HB 2008 which passed in November M which
said that anyone going to the the
Department of Economic Security um
they're required to like show their
papers even if they're only going to
pick up um like food stamps for their
kids who are citizens who have these
rights completely entitled to them so we
have a lot of really like crazy
immigration policy that just kind of
resonates from Arizona into the rest of
the
country organizers are for try to get
people to understand that uh the reason
there wages have stagnated for 30 years
that don't have to do with uh uh
undocumented
aliens and you know welfare mothers they
have to do with fundamental decisions
that are made by the Masters to uh shift
the nature of the economy to so that its
core becomes financial
institutions uh you go back to say
1970 financial institutions you know big
Banks and so on maybe had 3% of
corporate profits and now it's close to
a third and a side effect of that is
something else goes what goes is
production so U if you buy a car here
even it's a General Motors car a good
chance was assembled in Mexico not in a
US plant and these are very cons and
those are the policies that are Tak
taking
away sort of more or less the kind of
jobs that you can survive on raise a
family on you know and so on they're
taking away those jobs uh now it's an
old process like New England used to be
the manufacturing center of the country
but manufacturing was shifted elsewhere
like to the South because labor was
cheaper and in fact because you could
use slave labor like the criminalized
workers so that you know Manufacturing
declin in the sou in the north okay this
is the same process continuing except
now it happens to be across the border
and it always was to some extent across
the borders but now it's much more so to
even cheaper labor under even worse
conditions you know you can make more
money out of them I mean China for
example working conditions are
horrendous that's why there's labor
unrest all over China you know but
China's become kind of like an assembly
plant in to which uh the more advanced
economies of Asia and the United States
send parts and components and high
technology and they they assemble it
very cheaply for the you know for Dell
and HP and the rest of them great for
Walmart you know they get cheap goods
and uh working people here Suffer Well
you know those are the things that
people ought to understand it's not and
it's happening right before their eyes
like like it takes the Obama
Administration now pretty much owns the
oil
industry
uh what are they doing well they're
closing GM plants when you close a GM
plant for example you don't only destroy
the workforce you destroy the community
I mean a lot of these communities were
built by the workforce in the U in the
Auto industry or other Industries so
they're closing GM plants here at the
same time Obama's Secretary of
Transportation Roy leud is traveling
around Europe using Federal stimulus
money to get Spanish corporations to
build High-Speed Rail facilities that
could very well be built in that GM
plant but the banks and the owners make
more money out of it this way well you
know people ought to understand those
things for example they ought to be
taking over those plants uh and you know
producing it themselves and they ought
to be you know doing things like what
was happening in the 19 30s there was
massive labor unrest formation of the
CIO you know sit down strikes that's
what led to New Deal legislation but
it's got to be organized people have to
understand that it's not you know there
was a nativist movement then too say
it's all the fault of the Jews and the
immigrants and so on but that was
overwhelmed by a an active organized uh
labor movement well that's not happening
now but it ought to be and that's the
kind of thing that people who have the
kind of privilege that allows them to
work through these problems what do we
bring to people not ridiculing
them in the in the short term for
example I think that we should be
rebuilding our productive apparatus and
Def financializing the
economy uh most of the financial
institutions don't do anything that's
useful like when golden Sachs say what
they're being charged with now of
essentially taking vets making bets
against the rotten Securities that
they're selling so that when the
Securities fail they'll be insured by
the debt the CDO socalled I mean there's
no contribution to the economy from that
but it's a way for financial speculators
to get rich uh as they're doing so that
stuff should all be ended uh you know
there should be banks that perform the
function of banks you know you want some
money to buy a car you borrow some money
from a bank or something at a reasonable
rate okay that's what financial
institutions should be doing as far as
the productive apparatus is concerned it
should be rebuilt now those things don't
happen by themselves I there's a reason
why say the Asian countries are growing
and developing South Korea
Taiwan uh Japan China to an lesser
extent Singapore they have government
programs they have strong governments
which establish industrial policies
which Target
investment uh and
uh lay the basis for productive growth
now that's our history too I mean if you
use a computer and the internet and take
an airplane
and whatever it may be uh you're
benefiting from the state economy that
stuff was produced mostly in the state
sector of the economy not by
entrepreneurial initi itive and consumer
Choice it was done in uh universities
government labs and so on I mean the
internet was in the state system for
around 30 years before it was handed
over to private Enterprise so yeah we
had an industrial and that goes way back
to the origins of American History you
know we have an industrial system
because we were highly
protectionist um the state intervene
substantially in production in fact the
case of criminalizing black labor is a
case in point it provided a cheap labor
force for you know Andrew Carnegie and
so on so if you have a if you have a
functioning Society with a strong
government and we would hope a
democratic government that's U
developing programs of growth and
development for the population well you
can get economic growth if you the
reason why uh the propagandists for
small government are are screaming about
it is because they want people to hate
the
government so and that doesn't mean have
a weak state it means have a strong
state but for the rich uh but cut back
on you take a look at the at the you
know you listen to NPR forget Fox News
listen to NPR and ask what the
prescriptions are of the experts on how
to deal with the deficit every single
one says we're going to have to cut
entitlements we're going to have to cut
you know Medical Care Social Security
and so on
well you want if if you're serious about
the deficit which you should be there
are ways to cut it back I mean half the
deficit is military
spending we spend as much as the rest of
the world combined in military spending
that's about half the debt the deficit
the other half of the deficit roughly is
the exploding medical costs from the
highly inefficient privatized health
system which has twice the costs of
comparable countries well that's not
touched by the healthcare reform because
no matter what people want the insurance
company's going to make sure that
they're not touched so there are ways to
deal with these things but they're going
to shift power they're going to shift
power toward the population and away
from concentrated concentration sectors
of power now that's in the short term
you know those are things that you can
just legislate tomorrow in the longer
term I I agree with the workers in the
Mills and U around here in the late 19th
century who took it for granted that
those who work in the Mills should own
them why should there be private
ownership of the mill in which you're
working and you should have industrial
democracy just like you should have
popular democracy
elsewhere that's in the longer term but
you got to start somewhere and there are
immediate problems that have to be dealt
with real ones I like take say
environmental catastrophe you know
that's pretty serious we don't deal with
that we're not going to have to worry
about anything else and it's being
consciously
exacerbated by inherent properties of
the market system the ones I mentioned
not because the CEOs are bad people but
because that's their institutional role
to disregard externalities like the fate
of the species well we better do
something about that uh or there isn't
going to be much else to worry about
um well first of all as as far as the
Border Patrol having a brown population
about half of all border patrols are
like nonwhite and it doesn't really come
into play when they're you know
apprehending migrants there's no like
you know you would assume their
solidarity but there really isn't
there's a big disconnect between like
Mexicans who believe that they have
earned the right to come here because
their family was born here and those who
have come here recently like um I mean
my family is my family has been in the
United States for like 20 years but even
I see like in my dad he he even has like
some racism and I think that it comes
out of an attitude of fear because no
one wants to associate with the underdog
so they'll put themselves in any
position of power that they can find
it's also one of the highest paying jobs
that you can find like it's very highly
paid but despite that it's such a
stressful job that there's a really high
turnover rate and as far as border
patrol and the organization interacting
um we've been dealing with increasing
tension between Norm deaths and the
border patrol because about a year ago
like 13 people were given tickets for
littering because we were leaving
bottles of water in the desert and this
this like attitude is still going on but
we've had border patrol for example say
you can't do this you can't leave
bottles of water in the desert because
you're littering but you'll slash the
bottles in front of us dump them out and
leave the bottles there so it's just
like an increasing tension which we're
trying to dissipate as an organization
because we don't we don't want to have
that tension we don't want to fight we
just want to be able to do our job but
um there's a lot of like negotiation
that people are trying to happen like
trying to make happen but it's really
difficult because because of the high
turnover rate there are so many new
border patrol agents all the time that
it's impossible to like build
relationships and that's actually done
on purpose like as an organization they
don't want border patrol agents to build
relationships with anyone in the area
that they're working in yeah there's a
policy now where they um with border
patol placement because there's multiple
sectors you know border patrol
throughout the country um and we just
operate within the Tucson sector which
is the the most deadly there's over 50%
of all the deaths that occur on the
border happen in the Tucson area um and
there's a policy like on the books to
switch people's placements every six
months so you prevent them from
maintaining tie so like I I really see a
lot of Border policy and militarization
um about breaking up communities and
preventing communities from organizing
together and I think that the the racial
component of it is a really strong
element um and I think that's what this
leg this new legislation is also
reflecting so thank you for coming I
guess I would like to point out that no
more deaths always is taking volunteers
like over the summer if you want to come
out and volunteer that's great you can
just go on our website and apply
