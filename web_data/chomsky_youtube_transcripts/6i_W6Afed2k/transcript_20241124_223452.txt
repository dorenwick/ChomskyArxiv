[Applause]
uh first question always is can you hear
me in the back yeah
okay
um actually a week ago I thought Mother
Nature was going to continue with her
Antics and I'd have to come next spring
but we made
it the uh the title has a couple of
presuppositions which I want to say
something about uh one it's talking
about other cognitive processes so it's
assuming that uh the mind like the metal
systems mind brain is like everything
else in the body it's a modular system
with
subcomponents dedicated subcomponents
that have their own particular
properties their
own properties of growth and development
and of functioning and that integrate
with each other in the life of the
organism and the modular approach to the
Mind assumes that mental
systems uh are the same I think that's
pretty
uncontroversial the other presupposition
is controversial it's that language is
one of those systems when I talk about
language and other cognitive systems we
assuming that language exists as a
separate system not just some kind of
accidental connection of interaction of
other systems uh that's highly
controversial in fact it's a that
language exists in in the sense that can
be an independent object of serious
study uh is distinctly a minority
position and in fact has been for uh a
century uh the uh which is kind of
strange when you think about it because
on the surface it seems entirely obvious
if you consider a a newborn in infant
let's say uh the infant is faced with
the famous blooming buzzing confusion of
William James and somehow and how
incidentally is not known uh some in
fact barely studied because it hasn't
been recognized to be a problem though
it is uh the infant somehow picks out of
this uh comp complex collection of
unorganized data uh some sub parts which
are language
related that's not it's not easy to
figure out how that happens as I say
it's barely been studied just beginning
to be studied now so it picks out the
infant picks this out of the environment
reflexively of course in fact we now
know that that's going on even in
uterine to a certain extent and uh then
continues again pretty much reflexively
to U pick up the uh capacities that you
and I are now using uh and does so with
very little evidence not only is the
evidence scattered among other data but
that for M much of what anyone knows
there's almost no evidence at all that
goes from the meaning of the simplest
words when you look at them closely uh
up to
complex uh structures their uh and and
interpretation I'll give a couple of
examples but it's a pretty clear
furthermore it's a a humanly unique
capacity so if an infant has a
pet chimpanzee or song bird or kitten or
whatever uh the animal can't doesn't
even make the first step can't pick out
of the environment language related data
that's not because of sensory motor
defects or deficiencies or differences
even a chimpanzee auditory system is
pretty much the same as a human auditory
system of so much the same that it's
recently been discovered it even picks
out the distinctive features the kinds
of sound features that play a role in
language chimpanzee auditory system is
somehow constructed so it specifically
identifies those and the uh motor system
really doesn't matter I mean the people
learn language perfectly well children
learn language actually normally if
they're exposed only to sign uh not to
sound and if they use only sound sign
the course of development is virtually
identical in quite remarkable ways uh
and in fact the Lang the what's
sometimes called the externalization of
language the way it goes through the
sensory motor system it seems to be
modality independent uh and of course
say Apes have you the same visual system
essentially the same capacity for motor
action even more developed in some ways
than humans so that can't be the problem
it's got to be something about the
internal uh computational system that's
uniquely human but despite all these
facts and there are glaringly obvious
nevertheless it's there's kind of a
Dogma that language just can't be a
separate system uh it's got to be just a
combination of other things common maybe
to primates uh in fact it's if if you
take a look
across in comparative terms across other
organisms about the only known animal
that even has any of the rudimentary
properties of human language are certain
kinds of song birds and they are you
know billions of years away in terms of
evolutionary history so whatever
similarities they are has to be
convergence not a common ancestry so so
there's something very special about
language uh also it's it's pretty recent
in the human line there's really no
evidence for its existence Beyond maybe
100,000 years ago which is you know
flick of an eye in evolutionary terms
and
many millions of years after the
separation from the nearest species uh
well despite all of this which again is
glaringly obvious uh it has there is a
kind of a Doctrine it uh pretty that
it's if you took votes and among
cognitive scientists today most almost
all would agree with it uh that it can't
be true I think it's a interesting case
of denial of the obvious for which maybe
psychologists might want to have
something to say but uh you can easily
determine it from the literature uh also
it goes way back so if we go back to the
1950s when the kind of work that I'll be
talking about what's sometimes called
the uh generative Enterprise when it was
sort of barely beginning actually a
couple of graduate students at Harvard
who
were didn't believe any of the uh they
were highly skeptical of the standard
Behavioral Science
concepts of time at that point the same
view was just rampant so the leading the
leading philosopher most influential
philosopher who uh had anything to say
about these things was a very important
philosopher at Harvard WV Quin and his
conception which was highly influential
and not just in the Cambridge area but
everywhere else as well was that uh
language anguage is just every language
is just a fabric of
sentences uh associated with one another
and with stimuli by the mechanism of
conditioned response this was all within
the framework of the radical behaviorism
that was prevalent at the time it's a
view that's almost incoherent I mean how
can you even tell whether some of the
behaviors are sentences unless there's
an independent concept of language but
despite the coherence and the complete
lack of evidence in
fact masses of contrary evidence this
was a widely believed accepted view
outside in the fields around Linguistics
there was no cognitive science at the
time was just barely beginning uh in
linguistics itself a rather similar view
is held so it was a a common standard
view you can kind of read it in the
major literature of the time was what
was called the bo iian view uh named
after the
famous uh Anthropologist linguist France
boas whether he believed it or not is
another story but it was called The
boasian View namely that languages can
differ from one another in arbitrary
ways and when you approach a new
language to investigate you should do it
without any preconceptions about what a
language can be because they can all be
entirely different actually that's the
way I was taught in the late 1940s early
50s when I was a student the uh uh and
of course that would mean there is
really no such thing as language it's
sort of anything that comes along uh the
uh uh later on there were in in the
philosophical tradition more modern
philosophy another standard view that
developed while these pretty much remain
was not by not universally anymore by
the 60s and the 70s it's beginning to
change but uh a view that entered was
and sort of was developed also tracing
back to coin and in fact with deep roots
in history of uh psychology uh is that
uh any mental proc anything you can't
have a mental process at all unless it's
accessible to Consciousness may not be
conscious but at least has to be
accessible to Consciousness that's a
very widely held view in fact if you
look over the history of psychology it's
pretty hard to find anyone who
questioned it even Freud in fact talked
about the unconscious but if you read
Freud carefully he appears to have
assumed that uh he's not a model of
clarity but he seems to have assumed
that whatever is unconscious can in
principle be accessed by Consciousness
in fact
that's what underlies the practice of
psychoanalysis trying to bring things to
Consciousness it's very hard you might
check to find anyone who believed that
the uh process the mental processes are
processes of thinking planning
interpreting and so on that they can in
fact be inaccessible to Consciousness
although I think again the evidence is
overwhelming that that's what they are
almost entirely and in the case of
language almost completely which is why
you can't investigate a language by
introspection uh you can look at the
data but it's your of your own language
but it's as faren to you as it is to
anyone else what's inside is well the uh
the approaches to language at the time
were what are called procedural you
there were certain procedures of data
analysis you applied them to a corpus of
material and you could rearrange the
material and put into organized form
which again that's what theoretical
Linguistics was in fact the main
theoretical book was called Methods in
theoretic in structural Linguistics
methods because that's all there is
European Linguistics was approximately
the same and that again has the same
kind of framework of
assumptions uh it it follows from this
and was believed that there can't be any
real problems about language can't be
any puzzles because or doing is taking
data and organizing it and unless you
make a mistake or you have the wrong
procedures it can't really be anything
problematic uh it's uh uh there is a
modern variant of this which as I
mentioned is overwhelmingly dominates
the cognitive Sciences I'll return to
that well as I say it's kind of strange
because of the uh not just for exotic
reasons but because of the nature of
what's obvious before our eyes but
there's nothing novel about that that's
the way the Sciences have developed uh
so for example for
U one of the a great turning point in
the Sciences was around the 17th century
when scientists for the first time
really allowed themselves to be puzzled
about what looked like very simple
things so for thousands of years the
greatest scientists had a simple answer
to some obvious fact obvious fact is
that if say I pick up a cup of boiling
water and hold my hand over it uh if I
take my hand away the steam Rises and if
I let go of the cup the cup Falls so why
does the cup fall and the steam rise
well there's an answer given by
Aristotle they're seeking their natural
place and for thousands of years that
was considered a satisfactory answer
modern science actually begins
when Galileo and later others uh agreed
were were able to convince themselves
there's something puzzling about that
why does that happen and as soon as
those questions began to be asked and
investigated it was very quickly
discovered that uh all of our intuitions
about
how these things work are just
false intuition is about rate of fall
and almost any other simple thing and
it's at that point that when it came to
be discovered that what seemed to be
obvious was in fact not at all
understood it's at that moment that
modern science starts and that often has
yet to happen in the human Sciences the
things seem kind of obvious to us so we
don't really question them but if you
can bring yourself to be puzzled about
them you find that we really don't
understand anything uh well those are
the two presuppositions I'm going to
assume accept both namely that uh the
mind is modular like everything else in
the biological world every other thing
in or organisms and that language exists
as a separate
module uh this
uh uh it shouldn't really be surprising
that uh language and the mind should and
the human intelligence should follow the
biological Norm as I mentioned language
has itself has very special properties
I'll mention some of them and uh uh the
things that should have seemed puzzling
are very puzzling and still are when you
look closely and uh it's a a very recent
development if you look at the
evolutionary record uh uh of course we
don't have tape recordings but there's a
lot of archaeological evidence and the
archaeological evidence for the
existence of language sort of implicates
the existence of language is very modern
uh maybe within 100,000 years or so and
unique to humans it's not found in the
other homed branches neander THS for
example who lived up till maybe 30,000
years ago uh in fact we still having the
underfold change but uh it seems to be
very specifically human millions of
years after uh this the break from other
organisms uh there is a huge literature
by now just the last 20 years it's
burent on what's called evolution of
language which is itself kind of
curious uh evolution of language is a
very hard topic to study there is no
direct evidence
there's no comparative evidence uh
nobody knows where to look for
neurological evidence uh nevertheless
there there libraries full of books on
it especially the last 20 years if you
take much simpler topics there's almost
no literature on them so take say the
communication system of bees is quite
complex uh some scattered papers uh
practically nothing on it the reason is
it's just understood to be too hard it's
too hard to study I mean Sciences can
only study what's kind of right at the
borders of understanding uh for bees a
study of uh evolution of the
communication system of bees which is
quite complex you all know about the
waggle dance and that sort of thing uh
is far more easy to study I mean there's
about 500 species of bees they have
plenty of comparative evidence they have
different communication systems and some
appear to have no communication system
uh they get along about as as well as
the others which raises some questions
about what the function of those
complicated systems is but anyway
there's plenty of comparative evidence
the brain is Tiny it's the size of a
grass seed maybe 100,000 neurons uh
minuscule as compared to the human brain
uh very short gestation period couple of
days it can breede and so on and so
forth you can do any experiment you like
you want to take them apart that's
allowed you don't need consent forms or
ethical issues or anything so it's a
perfect organism to study as and humans
are impossible to study in all of those
dimensions and nevertheless there's
almost nothing about it because of the
recognition among biologists it is just
too hard uh on the other hand the kind
of tcid assumption that there can't
really be much to language uh makes it a
possible topic to study uh if you don't
know anything about language and
incidentally if you don't if you have
quite uh confused Notions about
Evolution there is a kind of a pop
biology which is very
widespread that assumes that uh uh
evolutionary change takes place in small
steps and adds up and finally you get
complex things happening it was believed
at one time not very long ago in fact uh
nobody believes it anymore by now
there's overwhelming evidence for uh
what's called saltation you know sudden
changes uh and it's even kind of
understood why this has been understood
in the biological sciences ever since at
least the 60s and the 70s when uh after
the discovery of regulatory mechanisms
cells that govern the uh action of the
genes that govern the action of other
genes if you change the regulatory
circuits a little bit you get huge
phenomenal differences
uh and there's by now many examples of
very small changes genetic changes that
lead to substantial uh differences in uh
what the organism is uh famous
discussion back in the 1970s by hob is
one of the discoverers of these
mechanisms Nobel laurate who argued that
if you you could change his image was
you could change an elephant to a fly
by just uh changing the timing and
organization of few regulatory circuits
and that kind that that you can't prove
yet but uh
similar smaller results have definitely
been shown so the idea that everything
has to happen by small steps is out the
window I might say that back in the
1950s and 60s in biology too it was
generally assumed that uh organisms can
vary in arbitrary ways so the next
organism you look at you have to
approach it quite differently from
others uh without preconceptions that is
totally out the window uh so much out
the window that by now there are even
proposals which are taken seriously one
by a molecular biologist at Boston
University that U there may be a
universal genome that is that all the
metazoa complex organisms that uh come
from the Cambrian explosion 500 million
years ago that they're all fundamentally
the same they all have a basically the
same genome with slight variations and
that doesn't look exotic anymore it may
not may be true maybe not but it's not
an exotic proposal given what's known
now about conservation of uh genes and
genetic structures going all the way to
bacteria up to humans and and uh uh Sim
and deep homologies you know very deep
similarities in the way organisms are
put together uh it's I think the same is
true of language but it's much more
controversial in this case well um give
you some illustrations from
today I go back a couple of months there
was a review article in the journal
science Main
joural scientific weekly American
American Association for advancement of
Science by a u well-known neuro
cognitive neuroscientist at the MOX pla
Institute in the Netherlands uh he was
reviewing several books on evolution of
language uh the uh and he kind of
dismissed most of them because they were
tainted by a a false assumption namely
the assumption that language is that
language actually exists that is that
there are rule
systems specific to language which uh uh
determine the character of sound systems
other externalization systems uh
determine the structures and meanings of
uh Expressions how they're interpreted
and that can't be uh it's violates the
Dogma uh and in fact the uh in order to
sort of establish the point the editors
added a photograph in the uh in in the
along with the journal article which is
a photograph of three infants uh
properly multi-racial it's got to be
politically correct uh so three infants
who seem to be more or less paying
attention to one another and the sub the
title says uh communication without syn
text without rules so that shows that
you can have communication without rules
uh they could have had a picture of
three bacteria which would have made the
same point they also communicate without
syntax uh but underlying this is a
fundamental Dogma which is almost never
questioned though it's almost certainly
false and that is that language is just
a system of
communication there's every reason to
believe that that that's not true uh in
fact again obvious reasons if you just
introspect uh almost all of your use of
language like 99% of it is
internal you can't go for a minute
without talking to yourself it takes a
tremendous Act of will to stop talking
to yourself well that's obviously not
communication that's thinking uh and
that's almost all the use of language in
fact goes on all night unfortun Ely but
uh uh and even interaction like you know
interaction among people parts of it are
communication but the large Parts aren't
they're just establishing social
relations uh whatever nevertheless this
Dogma is widely held and that leads to
the uh assumption that you can
understand something about language if
you look at communication systems of
other languages that's what underlies
the all of the work on evolution of
language you take a look at this work
you find it's not about evolution of
language at all it's speculations
speculations of course about the
evolution of communication to quite a
different topic it's not language uh and
in fact the language is used for
communication but so is everything else
we do style of dress whatever and the
large parts of language aren't use of
language is only peripherally for
communication but but if you think of
language as just being a system of
communication then you can look at
animal communication systems and you can
see if you can draw some analogies or
whatever actually you can't very much
but at least it's it's not ridiculous if
you look at the properties of language
is just instantly ridiculous even the
ones that I simple ones that I mentioned
uh well the uh uh with regard to uh
uh with regard to um communic there Al
the title of the article incidentally uh
is also revealing the title of the
article is without social context
question mark and what it's the point is
to criticize the idea that you can study
language without paying attention to the
social context of its
use well in fact if you're studying
communication that's true uh it wouldn't
make much sense to study communication
without looking at the circumstances of
its use uh it's close to topology on the
other hand it's completely false of the
study of the mechanisms that enter into
communication or that enter into other
aspects of life and in other areas of
the cognitive sciences and biology
that's just taken for granted so for
example if you study the structure of
the digestive system you can do that in
fact you do do that without asking what
happens when you have a Big Mac or
something in fact that you dismiss you
try to abstract away from that uh if
you're studying uh in the in mental
psychological systems there's very good
work on say object
recognition by infant Elizabeth spelly
Renee ban others they look at the try to
discover the mechanisms by experiment uh
it's without social context they're not
interested in they don't look at it when
two kids are playing maybe you can but
that's peripheral you try to abstract
away from that and Carry Out
experimental studies in a a refined
situation in which there's no social
context that's the way you study it
automatically like anything else in the
Sciences uh take one of the uh major uh
discoveries of uh study of perception um
one of the most interesting principles
that was discovered was uh Shimon
alman's uh what's called rigidity
principle it's a pretty surprising fact
it turns out that if a person is
presented with tcop images you know just
dots in a screen a few dots maybe three
or four dots on a screen and you have
several presentations of it what you see
what you perceive is a rigid object in
motion that's the structure that you
impose on the sequence of a few dots on
a screen it's the rigidity principle
which is a pretty remarkable Discovery
but has absolutely nothing to do with
social context again it's it's not even
real objects it's looking at cystoscopic
images like most of the study of vision
uh so and in fact throughout the
biological sciences just as in chemistry
or physics all of this is taken for
granted uh but in the study of language
and higher human mental processes this
considered something to be something
wrong with this you just can't approach
it in the manner of the Sciences uh the
uh so take just take a concrete examples
of this things in the way so I won't
write in the Blackboard but it's simple
enough so you can keep it in mind so
take an actual sentence say of English
uh take the sentence
uh they
Wonder uh if they wonder if the
mechanics fix the cars okay and suppose
you want to ask a question about how
many cars there were you can say how
many cars did they wonder if the
mechanics
fixed suppose you want to ask qu same
question about the mechanics well then
it comes out uh how many mechanics do
you wonder if fixed the cars well if
plainly something wrong with that you
can't say that uh has a perfectly good
meaning it's fine thought but they just
can't express it in language and that
generalizes very widely there's
principles that underly it that extend
to all sorts of other constructions but
did you uh do you have to study that in
a social context or in a uh you know
condition of
communication could it possibly be
learned I mean did you have evidence
that you're not allowed to say that or
you can't say it uh of course not I mean
this is just something like the rigidity
principle it's some property of the
system which if you're willing to reach
the stage of say Galileo if you want to
enter into modern science you should be
puzzled about uh and it's a typical
example Myriad examples of that kind and
any one of them illustrates the fact
that if you want to understand anything
about the properties of language you're
going to have to study it the way the
Sciences are pursued even U the
cognitive Sciences in other domains but
that's contrary to the uh
dogmas well uh what's developed uh out
of this is
uh in modern cognitive science is a very
strange concept of scientific
inquiry it's U it's not true of say the
study of VIs Vision like spelly by Aon
Omen and others uh but it is true
of the uh comp especially the
computational cognitive Sciences which
have the Merit that the proposals are
clear enough so you can actually
investigate them they're not just hand
waving about you know everything happens
like other primates uh they actually
have models that you can investigate
which is good and what you can show is
they fail
100% totally and it doesn't make any
difference because they succeed in terms
of a new conception of science which
dominates the computational cognitive
Sciences uh the idea that science is a
matter of uh developing models that M
that more or less approximate
data usually basian methods of
statistical analysis and basy methods
have the nice property that what
whatever the data is you can find the
basic analysis it will fit it you just
have to fix the pick the right priors
and so on and so forth not exactly
fitted but kind of Come Close uh This Is
Never Done In The Sciences so for
example if someone is studying say B
communication you know say the waggle
dance of some species of bees they don't
proceed by taking videotapes massive
videotapes of bees swarming and then do
a statistical analysis of them you know
basian analysis and from which you could
get a pretty good prediction of what's
going to happen the next time be swarm
but that's of absolutely no interest to
be scientists and quite rightly if you
apply for an NSF Grant to study it
they'll laugh at you on the other hand
if you apply for NSF Grant to do the
same thing with the Corpus a collection
of spoken language you get get it right
off that's considered very sophisticated
or say physics uh if if trying to study
Physics you don't take videotapes of
what's happening outside the window you
know leaves flowing around and so on and
do an analysis of them and get you know
pretty it's massive collection you get a
pretty good prediction of what's going
to happen tomorrow when you look out the
window a prediction that's way better
than any that a physicist can give in
fact they can't give you any prediction
at all and they don't care about uh but
the Sciences just aren't done like that
uh the only thing that is done like that
is uh particular branches of the
computational and other cognitive
sciences that deal with higher mental
faculties language in particular and
there's a Criterion of success the
Criterion of success is you get a little
better each time you have more data you
know more complicated basian analysis
more sophisticated methods and you get
get a little closer to the data as I say
in any other domain this would simply be
ridiculed but it is the Criterion of
success in the computational cognitive
Sciences novel approach uh you can find
it in all the major journals all the
time and uh uh but only for language not
even for something as close to language
as say a numerical calculation so for
example suppose you want to study the
rather interesting fact in fact very
surprising and puzzling fact that all
humans have a capacity for a numerical
computation they understand the number
system that's incidentally a a a fact
that did puzzle uh the scientists who
created the modern theory of evolution
Darwin and Wallace they were kind of
struck by the fact that all humans that
didn't experiment with it they just
recognized it was true that all humans
have uh comprehend the number system
which is very surprising from their
point of view because it couldn't have
been selected uh it's barely been used
in the whole history of humans a small
group of humans mostly pretty modern and
still small have you know made use of
this system but for most of almost
entire human history in fact most humans
in their day it just they never never
used it at all I they could handle small
numbers but so can apes and they could
handle what's called numerosity you know
knowing that 100 things is more than 80
things but not the particular
characteristics of the digital uh number
system you know the principles of
multiplication or addition and so on so
where' it come from uh big puzzle for
them if it wasn't selected how come it's
there uh in fact Darwin and Wallace had
a dispute over this co-founders of
theory of evolution Wallace argued that
there has to be some principle in
evolution apart from natural selection
uh to account for this mystery and
Darwin didn't agree with that but he
absolutely he had no alternative
suggestion remained a mystery uh it has
remained a mystery up to the present the
likely answer which we can now begin to
perceive is that if you look at the
actual mechanisms of language if there's
any time I may get to them or at Le
something about them but if you get if
you take a look at them carefully turns
out that uh uh if you simplify them
radically they in fact yield the number
system so it's very likely that uh the
number system just kind of piggybacked
off language if you have a language
however that evolved uh you just get the
number system as a free gift by
simplifying the language actually
reducing the Lexicon the collection of
words to one element then the basic
computational principles do give you a
model of the number system which may
very well be where it comes from which
would if true overcome the mystery well
um uh let's go on this I'll go back to
Enfield again his useful collection of
standard beliefs uh he argues that
language doesn't exist because it is
entirely grounded in a constellation of
cognitive capacities that each taken
separately has other functions as well
so it exists in the sense that say
today's weather exists I mean yeah it
does exist but it's not a topic of
scientific study it's just a
constellation of other factors that
operate independently and the argument
is that that's true of language there
isn't a particle of evidence for this
but it's almost universally held in the
cognitive Sciences not totally but very
widely and in fact as soon as you look
at the simplest thing you see it can't
be true so for example infant
acquisition of language uh or the one
example that I
mentioned U how is that a
constellation how how can that how can
what you know about that
follow from the interaction of other
cognitive processes and if so how and if
somebody makes this proposal in The
Sciences at least they'd be expected to
give some evidence for it look at some
simple cases but not in the cognitive
Sciences it's enough to wave your hands
at it uh mention one well-known thesis
in the study of acquisition of language
and one of the main figures in the field
is Michael Thomas C those of you in the
field are are familiar with this and his
view is that language is just a
structured inventory of linguistic
constructions acquired by processes
common to primates and others which are
kind of obscure so there's interrogative
constructions and passive constructions
and you just acquire them they could be
any other way you know just kind of
accidental this way and there's nothing
more to say about them also notice that
it would have to be finite obviously
it's not finite language is unbounded so
how does it become infinite well that's
just more hand waving
uh uh going back to Enfield talking
about the evolution of the system he
says there are well-developed
gradualist evolutionary arguments to
support the conclusion that there's no
such thing as language except as a
complex of independent cognitive
processes notice the notion
gradualist that's a reflection of the
mythology about Evolution that's still
maintained outside of biology so I'm in
evolutionary biology everyone knows
that's false but outside the field even
as close as U Know cognitive
Neuroscience it's still assumed that
somehow everything has to be gradualist
well known that that's not true but it's
U kind of what you learn in high school
and people believe it uh in this in the
Sciences too he's particularly uh upset
about what he calls the cist argument
and it is cist that the transition from
finite to infinite was not gradualist so
natural language is clearly infinite
there's no bound on the number of
Expressions that you can in principle
produce and understand uh just as is no
bound on the uh uh collection of triples
of numbers XYZ where Z is the product of
X and Y and in principle if you had
enough time and energy and so on you
could calculate it well language is the
same so how do you get from finite to
infinite well the fact that that's
saltation not gradualist is about as
controversial is the fact that 2 + 2
equal 4 there's no logically possible
alternative it has to be
exultation but the the fact that it is
is incompatible with the gradualist
conceptions now in a rational field when
you have some conception and you have
something that shows it's logically
impossible you give up the conception
but in a field that's dominated by
dogmas many of them ancient dogmas what
you do is deny the log the the facts
even if they're just logical truths and
that's unfortunately pretty common well
uh what do we actually know about
evolution of language not very much in
fact but the little bit that is
known uh is highly
suggestive uh one thing we know which is
kind of surprising if you're willing to
be puzzled by Simple Things uh is that
uh all humans have the same capacity for
language now all humans haven't been
studied but a lot of linguistic groups
have been studied and there are no known
group differences there are individual
differences but they're found in all
groups so for example if you take a an
infant from uh a tribe in say Papu New
Guinea that hasn't had contact with
other humans for you know tens of
thousands of years uh and you bring it
to Boston it's child is raised here
it'll be just like you same linguistic
capacities same cognitive of capacities
go on to become a Quantum physicist and
so on and conversely you take a infant
from here put it in Pap guine same thing
happen and in fact as far as it's known
there are either no or very Marg at most
very marginal differences among human
groups in cognitive capacities Al alog
together but in linguistics capacities
they're so if they exist they're so
minute you can't find them by present
methods so very marginal at most uh well
humans uh we all descend from fairly
small group that uh left
Africa maybe 50,000 years ago something
like that and that what that means is
for the past 50,000 years there's been
zero Evolution none there's been change
but change is not Evolution you know or
the fact that we're different from
hunter gatherers in our cultures and
size and everything else that's uh those
are signs of change but not Evolution if
there is evolution it's very superficial
things like say skin color and hair
length things like that but not in
fundamental human capacities as far as
anyone can tell so that's 50,000 years
with no Evolution at all which is
striking that means that whatever for
language whatever evolved was kind of
rigid never changed again uh it you know
of course languages differ but that's
not Evolution that's just something else
you know like the Norman Conquest uh
changed English enormously it made it
kind of like French but that's not
Evolution if languages change the way
they do say by the effect of teenage
jargon or something which is a very big
effect on language change it's not
Evolution it's just changes take place
within a fixed system and the system
seems to be pretty rigid for 50 at least
50,000 years
well if you go back about 50,000 years
before that you just find no evidence
that language even
existed uh the evidence and it's
commonly accepted by
paleoanthropologists that sometime in
that narrow window there was something
that sometimes Jared diamond called a
Great Leap Forward there's a short
period in which there's a sudden
explosion of complex
artifacts complex social
structures uh uh symbolic
Behavior representational
art Tak calculation of astronomical
events like you know phases of the moon
and so on uh all of this happened at
least in the archaeological record very
brief period maybe roughly 75,000 years
ago you can double the numbers if you
like or triple them and nothing much
changes it's because these numbers are
all so small that from an evolutionary
point of view they don't matter uh and
again that's millions of years after the
separation from uh other organ other
surviving organisms uh the uh well that
seems pretty clear and it's highly
suggestive about the nature of language
uh one critical property of language
crucial property uh in fact the core
property of language is that each
language consists of at its root of some
mechanism it's called a generative
process a mechanism which
constructs uh an infinite array of
structured Expressions which have
interpretations at uh in two systems two
interfaces they're called sensory motor
system you know for making noises or
signs or whatever and thought systems
for thinking planning interpretation so
on each of these structured Expressions
has to be mapped into those two systems
I that and it's unbounded as I said
there's and it's also digital like like
the numbers like there's a five-word
sentence six-word sentence there's no
five and a half word sentence and it
goes on indefinitely as long as you have
patience time and so on and virtually
everything that's produced is actually
novel in your own experience maybe in
the history of the language because the
sca the size of these uh sets is so
astronomical that you just keep
producing new things well that's the
most Elementary property of language now
start around by around
1950 a generative processes like that
were understood from a mathematical
point of view they really hadn't been in
the past but you know algorithms they're
called or you know the kind of program
that you can write for your laptop let's
say these these things began to be
understood and understood pretty well so
it was possible to ask what kind of a
generative process could have these
properties well uh H how could such a uh
notice that it it came apparent given
the limited evolutionary evidence it
must have happened pretty suddenly
that's a very brief window so presumably
what happened it's hard to think of an
alternative
is that in some small group these are
Hunter gather societies remember like a
100 people or something in some small
group uh wandering around Africa
somewhere some
individual uh underwent a slight
mutation which led to a small rewiring
of the brain which provided a generative
procedure now mutations take place in
individual uals not in groups so it
would have been one person who was lucky
enough or maybe unlucky enough to
undergo this mutation and that mutation
provided a gener a generative procedure
but remember it was one
person hence there's no possibility of
communication uh if this generative
procedure produced structures that were
linked to pre-existing conceptual
systems that that individual could think
it could plan it could inter interpret
and so on well that presumably yield
some selectional
Advantage uh a mutation can be
transferred to offspring usually is
partially at least uh and that means
over time there might have been a enough
people in this small group so that
somebody would have gotten the idea that
it's a it might be useful to externalize
it to map this internal system into a uh
something that can be perceived by
others maybe sound maybe sign you know
maybe tactile whatever might
be well that process of
externalization is a very tricky
one the internal system that developed
notice would have had no selectional
pressures
couldn't have it's just some something
that happened internally so therefore it
would have developed solely in terms
of a natural law it would be something
like a snowflake just takes on a perfect
form because there's there's no external
pressures on it so you'd expect an
internal system to
develop which is kind of like a
snowflake uh perfect in some sense and
since these are computational system
systems what that would presumably mean
is that it's it's computationally
efficient it meets perfect conditions of
computational complexity well a certain
amount is known about computational
complexity enough to set pretty strict
conditions on what that might be like so
what we would predict if if we're
investigating language is that there's
an internal
system uh
perfect in a sense that is as
computationally efficient as a system of
this kind can be uh which connects to
the two interfaces one of them the
interface the mapping to the thought
thought systems again has no external uh
uh forces acting on it so that ought to
be perfect too and also in variant uh
wouldn't change because there's no
pressures on the other hand the mapping
to the sensory motor system is quite
complex sensory motor system has been
been around for hundreds of thousands of
years pretty good evidence for that and
it had nothing to do with the internal
system so the finding the connection
between the internal system and the data
produced by the sensory motor system
that's a complex cognitive problem and
you can you can expect that it'll be
solved in many different ways and in
fact it is that's the task fa faced by
every infant an infant gets some data
from the sensory motor system has to
figure out how to M map it to what may
very well be a virtually invariant and
maybe perfectly designed internal system
of syntax and sematics and as far as we
know about one of the pretty obvious you
know overwhelmingly I me the facts about
language are getting better and better
established as research continues is
that while the externalization systems
vary enormously and are pretty
complex the internal system the syntax
and sematics they seem close to
invariant uh which is to be expected
because there's very little evidence for
them they're very much like that one
example that I gave you have almost no
evidence for it so they must follow from
rigid uh principles which are there
because they're computationally
efficient and may not have changed for
let's say 75,000 years whatever they
certainly haven't changed for 50,000
years well when you study a language
what do you study you study the external
externalization you learn the sounds you
learn the arbitrary word meaning
Association not quite arbitrary but
somewhat uh you learn the irregular
verbs you learn the order of words
things like that those are all parts of
externalization you don't learn the
syntax and the sem
semantics for one thing nobody can teach
it do you because it's barely
understood uh for another thing you know
it already it's part of your nature and
the same is true of the child acquiring
language that's roughly the
these are the general facts that we
observe uh they fit pretty well to this
story this
picture and U that looks like the
direction in which uh linguistic inquiry
ought to go uh and it is internal to
What's called the generative Enterprise
but quite separate from uh beliefs and
doctrines in the cognitive Sciences uh
especially the computational cognitive
Sciences uh And I stress again it's a
kind of a harsh judgment and I don't
have time to talk about it that there
are literally no results in the
computational cognitive science with
regard to language it's a huge
literature but if you look closely the
only results are in terms of this a
novel concept of scientific inquiry that
I mentioned and which has to do with
matching data not known in any other
field even in cognitive psychology well
there's uh there's a lot to say about
this but it's getting late so let me
just make one final Point any
computational system whatever it is has
to have sort sort of atoms of
computation you know minimal elements
that are operated on by the
computational principles say any system
you program for your laptop uh any
computational procedure so it has to be
true true of language those are roughly
wordlike first approximation not really
so we can take word words first
approximation to be the minimal Atomic
elements well where do they come from
here's something else that one should be
puzzled about uh how are words related
to the external World a word like say
cow or person or table or RI River or
anyone you pick there's a Dogma about
this as there is in most things
connected with language the Dogma is
What's called the referentialist
Dogma a child learns the the word cow
because it sees a cow and somebody says
cow and an association is established
between the cow and the word and that's
the meaning of the
word again the simplest invest
investigations show that this is totally
false it's it's interesting it's pretty
much true for it may be completely true
for animal communication uh every animal
communication system that's
known consists of atoms F finite number
of them of course uh which like say
which are tied to particular par
particular mind independent events
events that a physicist could describe
so say a a monkey a vervent monkey may
have say five
calls uh one of them is we we call it a
warning call it's connected to leaves
moving in the trees verit see Le leaves
moving the trees it emits this coal and
other verit run away uh or or could be
I'm hungry you know some hormonal change
which is identifiable and as far as far
as is known that's what animal
communication systems are like it's
completely false for human language
there are no sorry mind
independent uh properties properties
that can be identified by a physicist
that correlate with the words and are
constitute their meanings what they're
referred to in fact the meanings of
words really just give kind of
perspectives cognitive perspectives uh
that you can employ in uh discussing and
referring to the world uh there's no
time to give examples but uh it's
literally true true of just about
everything actually this was pretty well
understood in the 17th and 18th century
it's been interesting work on it it's
mostly forgotten well that raises a very
serious problem for one thing it's a
problem of where these things come from
how do they get into it must be that
they're internal every child knows them
you don't learn them you can't learn
them very comp complex when you look at
them they're invariant they're about if
they're different in various languages
very minor differences uh and how did
they
evolve that's a total mystery in fact
such such a deep mystery that it's very
possible that there'll never be any
insight into
it well let me stop stop
there
[Music]
well we would like to thank Professor
chovsky very very much for this
opportunity to come to speak for us this
evening and we will open the floor for a
few questions um so if you'd like to
raise your hand um I can give you the
microphone any
questions
over
here thank you Professor uh my name is
Frank over here sorry right here how you
doing uh you talked you were critical of
uh what you call gradualism in evolution
you were critical of what you called
gradualism in evolution and how people
think that uh it happened slowly over
time and then you talked about how
50,000 years ago compared to now we've
changed relatively little uh I was just
curious how how that works they seem
like contradictory ideas to me I was
just curious what you meant by that by
what by by by why nothing changed in
50,000 years well you said we haven't
really changed that much barely yeah but
then you uh I feel like that is evidence
of gradualism and I feel like you were
critical of gradual against gradualism
it goes against gradualism yeah if if uh
you know there's just constant
evolutionary change small changes why
should it have stopped somewhere before
50,000 years ago on the other hand if
what happened in human cognition is that
some rigid system were developed
suddenly for reasons having to do with n
natural law uh mutation of rewiring the
brain computational complexity and so on
but then there's no reason to expect it
to change I maybe it'll change someday
with another mutation but but uh there's
no reason to expect small changes so
this doesn't prove that U evolution is
not gradual is it's just consistent with
the view that it isn't which we know
anyway any other
question uh thank you Professor for your
very generous talk um just had a um kind
of a reflection I sort of um so
I was interested in one comment you made
about uh about kind of conscious and
non-conscious processes and how the kind
of the functional aspect of your
proposal is is more or less
non-conscious whereas there's a kind of
a conscious component which is like our
everyday lived experience which is not
kind of U going to be uh be able to
introspect upon this functional system
so I was wondering
um more on a philosophical not what how
exactly we're supposed to think about
phenomenal experience and kind of
conscious experience in terms of its
relationship to functional relationships
like your um specifically your
linguistic proposal but then also um
other domain specific proposals like uh
perception um there are those who don't
believe that perception is is you know
modu um modular or domain specific that
it's embodied or something to that
effect so I wonder if you had any
propose um Reflections on this kind of
um research now and uh how this relates
to kind of our phenomenal lived
experience well let's take visual
perception uh which
uh relatively
uncontroversial and take the one example
that I gave the rigidity
principle okay when when you're looking
at that sequence of tachistoscopic
presentations you perceive a rigid
object in MO in motion you can't prevent
yourself from perceiving that that's
what you perceive period uh what are
actually the stimuli that are actually
reaching
your
your your eyes your retina are just a
series of as few as three or
four presentations on a toyos scope you
know screen with lights uh of uh each of
which has several dots on it well you
have no way of introspecting into that
your phenomenal experience is a rigid
object in motion but the stimuli that
are hitting the
retina are a very small number of uh pre
presentations of a few
dots you can't introspect into that uh
the in fact it's a that's why it's a
discovery you know it's like the
discovery of the chemical structure of
you know coal Coal or something you
can't uh introspect into it uh so the
phenomenal descriptions you know they're
useful but they're useful as data they
tell you very little about what's going
on so it's kind of like everything else
in the world where you have data but it
doesn't tell you much about what's going
on that requires that's why you have to
take courses in physics and chemistry
and so on you know because the data
isn't transp isn't
transparent and it's hard for people to
deal
with but the same is true of our
conscious lives I we tend to take for
granted kind of like you know it's just
normal that that we can understand
everything about our ourselves in fact
we don't understand anything about
ourselves it's just it's even harder
than understanding uh how chemistry
works because it's so much more
complex and that's that's the crucial
step that the human Sciences really have
not take taken yet for the most part uh
that was taken in the Natural Sciences
around the 17th
century Ju Just the willingness to be
puzzled about things that look obvious
like what could be more obvious than if
I fact that if I let go of a cup it goes
down instead of up well you know Galilea
was willing to be puzzled about
that that's why you take physics courses
uh before that all you had to be told as
things are going to their natural
place and uh it's a big U psychological
step even in studying the uh external
world even greater in studying ourselves
because there we sort of feel that we
know everything what's conscious must be
what there is and in the in philosophy
modern philosophy it's it's kind of a
principle it happened to be John surl
who I was quoting but it's a widely
accepted principle that nothing can be a
mental process unless it's accessible to
Consciousness and as I mentioned if you
look over the intellectual history it's
very hard to find anyone who departed
from this
view okay we'll um take time for one
more question cuz it's getting late and
someone over here had raised a
hand uh yes Professor um you mentioned
the the problems behind the uh
referential Dogma um would you say that
we are in a uh if we reject that are we
in a situation that that Quin maybe puts
us in with the sorry sorry are we in a
situation uh similar to quin's
indeterminacy of translation would you
would you say that's where we're left
well Quin accepted the
Dogma but that's not surprising because
I everybody does today too uh yeah his
uh his idea his doctrine of
indeterminacy was in fact based on
assuming this so if you take his
framework that there's nothing but
Association and conditioning uh how do
you how do you know to take his example
uh when you hear a word let's say rabbit
this the case when a CH child hears the
word rabbit how does it know that the
word is referring to the uh that animal
running around sorry and not to some
part of the animal because if you see
the animal running around its leg is
also running around so how does the
child know that it's not the
leg and how does it not know in fact uh
that the word doesn't refer to some
disconnected object like the leg of this
one and of another one and so on that's
a standard problem induction it's hume's
problem of induction and as Hume
understood but his successors don't seem
to understand there's no way to solve
that problem Hume
himself contrary to what you may learn
in a philosophy course was a
rationalist not an empiricist he took
for granted and me says that the only
way you can solve the problem of
induction is by what he calls an animal
instinct
means there must be some internal
structure in your mind that leads you to
the to a particular answer because
there's no way to get it by induction
and that I think is correct and I think
the same could be true about the coin's
Gava guy you know rabbit uh the child
gets the right right answer because
they're built to get the right answer
and the right answer is not a uh in the
case of say rabbit you can easily show
that what a child understands to be a
rabbit is not something physically
identifiable
uh kind of guessing your ages but say my
grandchildren probably about your age
when they were kids U the story that
they
liked about a baby donkey named
Sylvester and so somebody you know
the baby donkey somehow is turned into a
rock and for the rest of the story it's
trying to conv convince its parents that
it's not a rock it's their baby donkey
and since children stories always end
happily something happens and it it ends
up and it's a baby donkey again and
everybody's happy but the interesting
fact is that every child understands
that that thing that has all the
physical properties of Iraq is in fact
Sylvester uh and the reason is and this
was in fact noticed by John lock that uh
people and in fact
animals are individuated by properties
like Psy psychic
continuity okay the same if you there's
some psychic continuity no matter how
you change physically I mean that's the
standard fairy tale you know you know
the evil witch turns the handsome prince
into a frog and he has all the
properties of a frog until till the
beautiful princess comes and kisses the
frog and he's a handsome
witch handsome prince again well again
every kid knows that it's always the
prince because it has the property of
Psy psychic continuity actually a lot of
Science Fiction is based on this but
it's even true of H the children's
stories well that alone tells you right
away that uh uh what individuates
objects is not a a collection of
physical properties but some complex
mental structure that we impose on them
like psychic
continuity and uh hum didn't think about
that lock in fact did but uh uh I should
say human recognized it was true that we
don't identify words by physical
properties but it runs across the whole
collection of words you can't find a a
word so simple that it doesn't have
those properties actually in the Natural
Sciences what you try to do is to
concoct you invent Concepts which do
have those properties so when you invent
the concept U say U you know electron or
something you intend it to be physically
identifiable you don't want it to have
its meaning change by what's in your
head you know that's the whole point so
it's a kind of a norm for the Sciences
but it's just not true of human language
and that goes back to quin's example the
solution to his problem is essent
essentially hum's hum's solution to the
problem of induction no solution except
you're built to pick things
to to structure the world in a certain
way so that's the way to do
it well thank you so much Professor for
giving us some insight into your area of
expertise we'd like to present to you a
small token of our appreciation um we'd
love to have you back anytime you'd have
us so ladies and gentlemen Professor Nom
Chomsky thank you very
much thank
you
thank
you
