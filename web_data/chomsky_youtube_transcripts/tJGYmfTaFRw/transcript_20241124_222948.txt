I'm edovo you're about to see an
interview I recorded with Noam Chomsky
but before we begin I want to provide
some context on why we're running this
interview
I don't agree with a lot of what name
Chomsky says here however it's important
to recognize the points of view he puts
forward
these are influential and widespread
views
and Chomsky is one of their preeminent
advocates
in the interview Noam Chomsky says the
US wants to keep the war in Ukraine
going to weaken Russia
this analysis gives no agency to Ukraine
portraying it as a pawn of the US
he says that Finland and Sweden applied
to join NATO to gain New Market
opportunities for their weapons which
ignores that they ended Decades of
neutrality just months after the
invasion of Ukraine
his view of Taiwan is one-sided blaming
the us but ignoring China's undermining
of the status quo in the Taiwan Strait
I've written this interview up for the
new Statesman and the link is in the
description so you can read more there
thanks so much for coming on the podcast
Mr Chomsky
um you've got this fascinating book of
interviews uh just published it ranges
over a period of a year of about a year
from 2021 to 2022. obviously a pivotal
period in um in the history of
of the world
um particularly because of the the
invasion of Ukraine and that's that's
where I want to start the second chapter
is titled Biden's foreign policy is
largely largely indistinguishable from
Trump's and it's from 2021 and I think
maybe one thing that the invasion of
Ukraine shows is that I think Biden
approached this crisis quite differently
to Trump
um do you share that assessment it's
very hard to say because Trump is a
loose cannon you have no idea what his
policy was
so one moment he says we have to
work something out with Russia the next
moment he says we have to keep the
Bagram Air Base
in Afghanistan for a base for attacking
Russia
who knows what his policy is it's
whatever he saw on Fox news this morning
so you can't compare Biden's policy with
Trump's Biden's policy is pretty clear
for explicit it's been stated we must
continue the war in order to severely
weaken Russia
that's the policy
same as Britain which follows along
so when there were
some possibilities of negotiations
[Music]
a year ago last March April
uh both Britain and the United States
informed
give that they did not regard this as a
good time for negotiations
and the U.S policy continues to be to
as they put it
formally to
strengthen Ukraine's position so it'll
be in a better position for negotiations
in other words no negotiations no
diplomacy
there's no way nobody explains how
continuing the war with battering
Ukraine is going to put them in a better
position
that's just uh presuppose somehow
you can see the same in the uh the
international relations literature so
take a look at the
last issue of Foreign Affairs the major
International Affairs Journal article by
two leading commentators saying exactly
what I just said I have to continue the
war to put Ukraine in a stronger
position for eventual negotiations how
that's going to happen is some miracle
unexplained meanwhile Ukraine's getting
battered devastated
say then every I know even military
commentators are pointing out that for
the United States this is a bargain
for a fraction of the Colossal military
budget the United States is able to
severely degrade the military forces of
its own it's only real military
adversary
well whether that's the reason or not I
don't know you can ask yourself but
those are the facts is it wrong for the
U.S to provide weapons to Ukraine so
that they can continue the fight as long
as they wish
and join negotiations when they so
decide I think it's reasonable to
provide weapons to Ukraine to defend
itself against aggression
but the United States has a position is
the U.S going to insist
that there be no negotiations so that we
can severely weaken Russia
don't forget Ukraine is not a free actor
in this they're dependent on what the
United States determines in several of
the interviews uh you warn of the risk
of nuclear war
um for instance you warned that if the
U.S continues delivering weapons to
Ukraine um the it's it's I think you
said it's easy to see to to foresee a
path to escalation that ends with
nuclear war clearly over the past year
uh that's not what we've seen we've seen
weapons continually ramp up
um for example the high Mars systems
that the US provided and most recently
of course these tank systems
um are you still worried about the risk
of nuclear war
anyone
who has a gray cell functioning should
be worried about the risk of nuclear war
that's why the Doomsday Clock Was set to
90 seconds to midnight
there are many possible scenarios that
could lead to nuclear war
both in
Ukraine and also in China with regard to
China
for example your current if let's
imagine that the
prognostications of
U.S political leaders are correct
suppose it turns out that Ukraine can
come close to defeating Russia
is is Putin just gonna pack up his bags
and say well that was nice so go home to
Oblivion or will he raise the
attack against Ukraine and notice
but let me ask a simple question when
the United States and Britain were
smashing Baghdad to pieces did any
foreign leaders go to visit Baghdad
no because when the U.S and Britain go
to war they go for the jugular they
destroy everything
Communications Transportation energy
anything that makes Society function
that hasn't happened in Ukraine
undoubtedly Russia could do it
presumably with Conventional Weapons
could make care of as unlivable as
Baghdad was
could move into attacking supply lines
in Western Ukraine
could be a confrontation with NATO then
what happens
well just another step up the escalation
ladder
and once you start on that nobody knows
where it leads
so to be to fail to be considered
concerned about nuclear war is to be out
of your mind are you implying that
Russia is fighting more humanely than
the US and UK were in Iraq
I'm not implying that it's obvious
just take what I just asked
did anybody go did you remember foreign
leaders going to bed in fact I had to
withdraw everybody withdraw the U.N
inspectors withdrew a peace delegation
that was on the ground
because the attack was so
um severe and extreme
that's the U.S British style of War
take a look at casualties
all I know is the official numbers
maybe you know more so the official U.N
numbers are about eight thousand
civilian casualties how many civilian
casualties were there when the US and
Britain attacked Iraq and that's only
one case
how many civilian casualties were there
when Israel invaded Lebanon
about twenty thousand
well
ask yourself the question
what kind of a settlement would be
acceptable in Ukraine uh what kind of
final outcome should the ukrainians uh
obviously Ukraine's Western backers
pushful well the obvious answer is the
Minsk agreement Minsk too
which offered a plausible settlement
first of all Ukraine would not be a
member of NATO that's the red line that
every Russian leader has insisted on
since Yeltsin and Gorbachev it's well
known to U.S and British analysts and
the Diplomatic Corps have all been
warning Washington
for 30 years that
pressing this will be Reckless and
dangerous that's nothing new so point
one Ukraine
gains the status of say Austria during
the Cold War or Mexico today Mexico
can't join a hustle military Alliance
there's no treaty about it but it's
perfectly obvious so that's point one
with regard to Don Basque the Minsk
agreements called for
a degree of autonomy for donbass within
a Ukrainian Federation
so maybe something like Switzerland or
Belgium or other and Federated systems
with regard to Crimea it says we put it
off for the moment
let it be discussed later
those are the basic outlines of a
solution under the mince to agreement
which incidentally is uh endorsed by the
U.N security Council
U.S and British Britain agreeing
so would would Ukraine agree to that
would Russia agree to that
there's only one way to find out try in
fact if you look at the official records
as late as February last February 2022 a
couple weeks before the invasion
uh the Russians were
didn't actually Advocate it but they
mentioned the Minsk as a possible
outcome
so is it possible we don't know
as long as you insist on not trying
can't find out if the invasion of
Ukraine were prompted by was was
triggered by Ukraine moving towards NATO
would Russia not have
attacked Finland which has just joined
NATO and announced its intention to join
NATO about uh around a year ago around
the time of the invasion of Ukraine
there has never been the slightest
indication of any Russian concern about
Sweden and Finland
the reasons for swinland Sweden and
Finland moving to join NATO have nothing
to do with fear of a Russian attack
which has never been even conceived
there's a very simple reason why Finland
and Sweden want to join NATO
Sweden and Finland both have
quite sophisticated Advanced military
Industries
they've been pretty much integrated into
NATO with joint operations and so on
uh joining NATO directly gives them
great New Market opportunities new
access to Advanced Equipment and so on
but there has never been any indication
except for Western uh propaganda about
Russian threats to Finland and Sweden
and it's if you think about it it's just
inconceivable
I mean
you recall George Orwell's concept of
doublethink
the ability to have two contradictory
ideas in mind and believe them both
that's NATO right now
uh on the one hand they're gloating over
the fact that the Russian military is so
incompetent that they can't conquer
towns uh 20 kilometers from the border
on the other hand they're uh wailing in
fear about the idea that the new Peter
the Great is going to conquer Europe
I mean that's why the whole Global South
is looking at the US and Britain and
collapsing in ridicule
is there not a difference between
Russia's intentions and Russia's
capabilities
um
I mean its intentions were I think quite
clearly to conquer most of Ukraine and
its capabilities were
uh somewhat far below that that
objective
you should certainly look both at
intentions and capabilities both are
clear
the capabilities have become
very clear during the failure of the
Russian attempts in Ukraine that's what
western analysts are gloating about
totally incompetent military and that's
the capabilities
what are the intentions
we have about 30 years of a documentary
record on intentions
the intentions begin with Gorbachev
he had an arrangement
an agreement a firm unambiguous
agreement with President Bush first bush
been a lot of Deceit about this so I
suggest you look at the documents which
are available online at the National
Security archive
unambiguous
clear Promise by President Bush that if
Gorbachev agreed to allow Germany
to be unified and join NATO which is
quite a concession in the light of
History if he agreed to that NATO would
not move one inch to the east of Germany
firm explicit unambiguous promise
well
Bill Clinton came into the presidency
after a year or two be violated it he
said we're going to bring in uh
uh former Russian satellites to the
Russian border into NATO he explained to
his friend Yeltsin why he was doing this
it's a document he said to Yeltsin don't
take it too seriously I just have to do
it for domestic political reasons
I need the Polish vote
I need Eastern European vote so we'll
carry this meaningless act out well the
Russians tolerated that
but they made it very clear early on all
of them that Georgia and Ukraine were
redlines right in the Russian
geostrategic Heartland no Russian leader
Gorbachev Yeltsin anyone would accept
them joining a foreign hostile military
Alliance practically the whole top U.S
Diplomatic Corps
with any knowledge of Russia has been
warning for 30 years warning Washington
that it is reckless and dangerous to try
to cross this red line
oh Clinton's Secretary of Defense
William Perry
was so Furious he practically resigned
when Clinton broke the promise
uh Hawks and doves all of them Robert
Gates the hawkish defense minister of
bush the two uh William Burns head of
the CIA
it's virtually unanimous warning
Washington that this is extremely
dangerous nobody ever mentioned Finland
and Norway because it was never even an
issue the only issue was Ukraine and
Georgia
so we know about the intentions and as I
say there's a record right up to the
invasion of Russian proposals which are
no you no NATO membership and
some kind of arrangement about the
donbass region
exactly what could only find out with
negotiations which the U.S and British
or Britain refuse
so that's the we have very good evidence
about intentions a very good evidence
about capabilities we can therefore we
have two options we can draw the
rational conclusion or we can follow the
party line as dictated by
Washington and London those are the
choices
you've been clear about your opposition
to uh to make to Nato membership for
Ukraine and Georgia
um but nonetheless uh NATO membership is
very popular among ukrainians and
Georgians I think polls show
overwhelming support for joining why is
uh NATO membership so popular among
these people even if according to you
it's not in the interest of their
countries to join it's not me it's
repeat the head of the CIA virtually the
entire diplomatic or uh
the former head of the CIA Robert Gates
Paul nitzi
Hawks Hawks and doves have all been
saying for 30 years
that it is reckless and dangerous to try
to cross this clear red line and you
understand that perfectly well
suppose that Mexico
decided to join a chinese-run
international military Alliance and to
get heavy weapons from China aimed at
the United States move for
interoperability of Chinese and Mexican
military forces what do you think the
United States would do
well we don't have to ask because Mexico
would be blown away
as as soon as the first step towards
this began
well it's much more serious in the case
of Russia
the United States has not been invaded
twice in the last century and virtually
destroyed through Ukraine that's a
parallel to perhaps what's happening in
Ukraine in Taiwan which China has
threatened to invade to reunify by force
if necessary
would it be right for the United States
and other Western countries to defend
Taiwan in case of an invasion well first
of all let's go back to the facts about
Taiwan instead of the American British
propaganda line
uh what has happened in Taiwan
there has been a an agreement for 50
years
the United States and China agreed back
in the 70s on what's called a one China
policy
if you look at the propaganda line now
it says it's a Chinese policy it's not
it's a chinese-american policy you can
read the documents very explicit the
agreement is Taiwan is part of China
and neither side will take measures to
disrupt the peaceful Arrangements held
for 50 years
which is pretty good in international
affairs the United States has been
severely provoking China so far they
have reacted only symbolically
here that's described as Chinese
aggression
take a look at the facts Nancy Pelosi
Speaker of the House went to visit
Taiwan changes the Diplomatic status no
the Kevin McCarthy's doing it United
States
Senate Foreign Relations Senate Foreign
Relations Committee
passed a Taiwan Policy Act calling for
Taiwan to have the same diplomatic
status as any non-nato member uh
more weapon supplies
interoperability of weapons
pretty much the same steps that were
taken
by the burden Administration on the
years prior to the invasion of Ukraine
to move towards integrating Ukraine into
NATO
even giving them an enhanced program for
NATO membership this is deemed
duplicated by the United States and
Taiwan
furthermore the United States is
carrying out a program in official
terminology to encircle China with a
ring of Sentinel States armed with
Advanced Precision weapons provided by
the United States aimed at China the
ring is South Korea Japan Australia
American protectorates Guam and so on
backed by Major Naval Maneuvers in the
Pacific the rimpac Maneuvers aimed at
China
the United States for the first time has
established establishing permanent
nuclear-capable B-52 bases in Guam and
Northern Australia Norwin Australia
uh flight
can reach China from there providing
Australia Britain and the United States
providing Australia with nuclear
submarines to operate in the South China
Sea
all of these are
and in addition to this the United
States has declared what the business
press actually accurately calls War
economic war against China to try to
prevent China from developing
technologically for a generation putting
great pressure on European South Korean
Japanese Industries to stop providing
China with the means to develop its
economy what is the threat of uh China
at this point
the threat is coming from the United
States with of course Britain following
it just a lack at this point
it's not an independent country anymore
but Britain United States and its
British Lackey are provoking China
openly now
well is China a saintly country of
course not
China is violating international law in
the South China Sea by fortifying some
rocks that are disputed doing other
things it's not a nice place but if you
look at the talk about Taiwan
it's coming from the West
yes China is when the United States
carries out some provocative act like
house Speaker visiting Taiwan China
carried out
Naval activities
demonstrating that it can blockade
Taiwan
it was in reaction to the visit
another symbolic visits are taking place
now
could it explode could you know
so far there's
nothing on the Chinese side but could
happen if you keep provoking it could
explode
so yes there's a threat of War there is
it ever right for the United States to
provide weapons to democracies under
threat of invasion by dictatorships
like Saudi Arabia for example where
Britain and the United States are happy
to pour arms into the one one of the
most
harsh dictatorships in the world which
is furthermore carrying out has been
carrying out military operations that
killed about 350 000 people in Yemen yes
Britain and the United States are happy
to do that if they can make money from
it all right named Chomsky thanks so
