thanks everybody for taking the time to
join us
the Shippensburg University Department
of Sociology and anthropology would like
to welcome everyone to tonight's event
and evening with Noam Chomsky we're
truly honored and grateful to have
professor Chomsky speak with us tonight
we want to thank Noam as well as his
wife valaria as well as Scott Donald for
helping us to coordinate this
opportunity professor Chomsky began
teaching at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1955 where he remained
until moving to the University of
Arizona in 2017 he's one of the most
cited scholars in modern history has
written more than 100 books and is a
highly sought after speaker at the most
prestigious institutions in the world
professor Chomsky has conducted
groundbreaking worth work both as a
linguist as well as a social philosopher
for his work on social problems and
crises he has been called one of the
most notable contemporary champions of
the people a genuine people's hero an
inspiration for struggles all over the
world for that basic decency known as
freedom professor Chomsky has previously
stated that the intellectual tradition
is one of servility to power and if I
didn't betray it I'd be ashamed of
myself tonight he'll help us grapple
with questions that all of us should be
asking of those in power so first I'll
say professor Chomsky welcome back to
the East Coast kind of you usually would
have a rousing round of applause I'm
sure everyone's happy to see you welcome
glad to be almost home that's right so
tonight's event will be an informal talk
based solely off of questions from the
audience and the moderator so I'll lead
off so no one feels the pressure to ask
the first question and I'm sure it's a
question on everybody's mind but then
we'll just I'll be monitoring the Q&A
window go ahead and ask your questions
in the Q&A bubble not in the chat window
just so we can keep them all in one
place and I'll just go through them and
try to ask as many as I can in the hour
that we have and so I'll go ahead and
start it off and then we'll get going so
our first question for professor Chomsky
is what has been your reaction to the
cove in nineteen pandemic particularly
the US government's reaction to it at
the federal and the state levels
countries have reacted in different ways
there's by now a pretty good record the
countries on China and the countries on
its periphery responded very quickly to
the news that came out from China early
January about the crisis Chinese
scientists had identified the source of
the at that time epidemic now pandemic
had identified it as a corona virus had
sequenced the genome and sent the
information out by January 7th and some
reacted Taiwan South Korea Singapore
quickly reacted and pretty much have it
under control
New Zealand is maybe the champion they
went into total lockdown for a month and
seemed to have virtually eliminated
Europe kind of dithered waited much too
long didn't pay that much attention but
the more organized societies like
Germany in Norway Finland they did
respond that Germany I think has
probably the lowest the death rate of
any country Britain is a mixed reaction
but they finally took some action down
at the bottom of the barrel is the
United States it is so dysfunctional
that it is the only major country that
cannot even provide data on the number
of cases and maybe they were right about
the number of deaths we don't know if
you look at the lists published
internationally about countries the u.s.
is listed with an asterisk saying the
estimated because we can't even give
them data the Trump administration
reaction was
beyond scandalous US intelligence right
right away just as others did who were
paying attention
they were bombarding the White House
through January and February with trying
to get somebody to listen the Trump was
either playing golf or looking at his TV
ratings more likely the no reaction
something there was some of what
happened is just beyond description so
on February 10th when the pandemic was
already raging Trump submitted his
budget proposals for the next year and
they're really worth reading I mean it's
I just can't find words to describe it
will say what it is forever throughout
his entire term Trump had been defunding
all of the health related components of
the government in fact in October he
killed completely a US aid project which
was identifying viruses in many
countries including China that was
killed but others were simply defunded
going back to the budget he continued
the defunding of the health care parts
of the government Center for Disease
Control and so on all further defunded
this is while the pandemic is raging
some things received extra funding the
Pentagon of course his famous wall of
course but also fossil fuel industries
got an extra subsidy to try to destroy
the environment that sustains human life
it's as if it came out of the mind of
some indescribable sociopath let's kill
as many people as we can from the
pandemic that's spreading and from the
much more serious crisis that's not far
down the road of the environmental
crisis meanwhile he was making every
possible statement you can imagine this
alarm running through it but one day
it's the common cold forget about it the
next day it's a serious epidemic but I
have it all in hand the next day go back
to work the next day closure and finally
when it became impossible to deny
he said yeah terribly serious crisis I'm
the first person in the world to have
identified her as a pandemic and I've
done amazing things to keep it under
control all of this is echoed
step-by-step by his echo chamber Fox
News so every turn in the road it's
amplified by Fox News now Sean Hannity
will say that his decision to been
traveled to China it was the greatest
move in human history then the next day
says the opposite that was the greatest
thing that ever happened and meanwhile
there's a kind of a dialogue going on
the Fox News is there to amplify and
lord everything he says and then he
turns he looks at Fox News the next
morning he decides he learns from them
what he's supposed to say today no it's
a amazing dialogue but the end result is
just astonishing however we should
remember that this is not all Trump
Trump has made it much worse than it had
to be but the roots go back much earlier
and if we want to prevent a future
pandemic which is very likely it's
predicted very likely be worse than this
one
global warming and have a death
destruction so if we want it if we want
to protect ourselves from it we should
ask yourself what are the roots that's
the only reasonable thing to do and
they're not obscure there are basically
two factors one is just colossal market
failure deeply rooted in the economic
system the other and this was amplified
by the particularly savage form of
capitalism that was introduced basically
by Ronald Reagan the neoliberal programs
so take a look at what happened
pandemics were predicted by scientists
including coronavirus pandemics in fact
this became apparent to the scientific
world in 2003 the SARS epidemic which
was a corona virus at that point was
mostly in Asia it was contained vaccines
were developed but they were not carried
through to the testing phase well so it
was known and they predicted yes there's
going to be more plan demyx like this
probably coronavirus but somebody has to
pick up the ball and run with it it's
not enough to have the knowledge well
there's two possible candidates one is
the drug companies they have the
resources the will so on but they are
capitalist institutions they follow
market signals and the market signals
were very clear there's no profit to be
made in fending off an anticipated
catastrophe you can make more money
doing other things no selling body
creams or whatever so they weren't
interested well so far that's just
ordinary capitalist logic but we
basically live with but then comes along
the second hammer blow well
doesn't government step in after all
that's possible
I old enough to remember the days when
the polio was a very frightening threat
very series it was ended by discovery of
a vaccine Salk vaccine under the
government auspices institutions began
with the Roosevelt administration and
continued and the Salk vaccine of course
was offered free
so the fact Jonas Salk himself when
asked why don't you try to get a patent
said look this is this public as the
Sonny's we don't try to make money off
of saving people's lives well why not do
that you'll recall Ronald Reagan's
mantra government is the problem not the
solution actually that's not quite
accurate government is the problem
when it comes time to do something that
people could benefit from but when the
corporate sector needs something
government very definitely is the
solution now he made that very clear
from the first moments of his
administration there's no time to run
through it but lavish gifts the
corporations and it continues its
continuing right now with the latest
bailout but so that's it you have to
understand that concept
it's double-edged one thing for people
another for the rich and the corporate
sector but for the since this would be
for the people government is not the
answer
oh so therefore the government didn't do
anything now actually there are few
qualifications to that the Obama
administration did recognize that
there's a potential serious problem
right after the Ebola epidemic it was in
the swine flu epidemic 2009 it was
pretty clear that something serious was
happening
the you take a look what's happening
today in the United States the doctors
and nurses who were showing immense
courage after say it's just inspiring
have to make the agonizing decision of
who were going to kill today and the
reason they have to do that is they
don't have the equipment to save you
kirsta the most crucial element the real
bottle makers ventilators they don't
have ventilators why well in 2009 Obama
the Obama administration did contract
with a small company that was producing
high-quality low-cost ventilators the
company was soon bought up by a larger
corporation to vidiian which produced a
very expensive high quality ventilators
they shelf the project presumably
because it was interfering with their
sales now shortly after they came to the
government and said they just wanted to
get out of the contract because the
project is producing low-cost
ventilators was simply not profitable
enough that could make more money by
something else well okay that was dead
now you have the hospitals with the
nurses and doctors trying to figure out
who to kill these are the root the basic
roots of the crisis it extends like take
hospitals they don't have enough beds
why don't they have enough beds because
the US health system is a for-profit
privatized system it runs on business
models business calls for efficiency you
don't have spare capacity that's you
have what's needed for the normal
situation that people who have been in
hospitals during this period I have know
that there's a severe cost to patients
in normal circumstances not enough
nursing care or all sorts of problems go
through but when something outside the
normal range happens is of course total
catastrophe there's no there's no spare
facilities the countries like say the
Germany South Korea others they were
ready for this so Germany had extra
diagnostic capacity and hospital
capacity they were able to take care of
them we don't we're rigidly under the
control of business models now that's
true of the health system altogether
which is just a scandal
well it's twice the per capita costs of
other countries some of the worst
outcomes and there are estimates of what
this costs the American people the most
recent one couple of months ago before
the crisis came out in the world's
leading medical journal The Lancet in
its London that a estimate in a study
estimated that the annual annual cost of
Americans from the privatized for-profit
system is half a trillion dollars a year
and sixty-eight thousand extra deaths a
year that's just the normal situation
gets out of sight yes there's something
goes wrong well these are very serious
issues now you go back to the this you
can't blame on Trump this is because
it's deeply embedded not only in the
whole Catholic system but in the
particularly savage form of it that
we've been living with for generations
the neoliberal policies and there are
many aspects to this so take a look
right now at the Congressional the
Congress passed
legislation to try to deal with the
terrible situation that people are in
people are losing the jobs state they
don't have food literally don't have
food people are lining up for miles
before food banks trying to see if they
can get piece of bread so they're trying
to do something with that with a
substantive substantial funding for
people not enough but something a lot of
that is going to corporations who said
you know when a crisis comes when
they're in trouble they throw away their
copies of Ayn Rand and they come running
to the 90 state to feed you know that's
normal goes on over and over I mean it's
routine since Reagan well what were
these corporations doing during the
period the last couple of years of very
high profits not just gorging themselves
on money and plenty of it were they
building up their enterprises trying to
improve services no they were engaged in
stock buybacks which increase the profit
for shareholders mostly very wealthy and
increase the pay for management so
that's what they were doing and now they
need money from the nanny state they
were also sending their offices to
offshore tax havens
so Apple Computer the richest company is
officially an Irish company if they have
an office somewhere Dublin with probably
a clerk running computer and that's
Apple so they pay very low taxes in
Bermuda and I haven't is that
a necessity I mean money is being given
to these corporations could come with
conditionalities saying you'll not going
to get a penny from us unless you have
an ironclad agreement they're gonna stop
all stock buybacks and all use of tax
agents well is that utopian not at all
that was the law and it was enforced
rigorously up until Reagan came into
office he opened the spigot and
following the advice of Milton Friedman
other you know so-called libertarians he
said government shouldn't be doing
anything let the private sector go off
and be free and everything will be
wonderful that we're not talking small
change here this is tens of trillions of
dollars of pure robbery of the public it
can be stopped just the way it was
stopped from the Roosevelt
administration up until brilliant that's
just the beginning a lot of other things
we can think about but all of these
matters are part of the root of the
problem some of it particular to the
United States which is why the United
States has the worst record it's the
center the epicenter of the crisis as I
said can't even provide data the let
alone proper equipment and support so
that's special to the United States
doesn't have to happen in some countries
that functions not happening but the
deeper problems are much much more
fundamental they have to do with the
nature of the socio-economic system has
to be changed it take and it's very it's
very interesting to say I don't know if
you want me to come on well why we go
into the next question I can go on
indefinitely that's why we love hearing
from you so I it's hard to tell which
question is
more popular but I think I think an
election question is a little more
popular so we'll start with the election
question and then we'll move on to the
climate change question which you
alluded to but this question has been
asked a variety of ways in the in the
queue a bubble so I'll try to summarize
it but you have a lot of college
students in the audience tonight
and a lot of them are very energized by
the Sanders campaign and as you know
Sanders dropped out today so as a way to
try to reach across these different
questions here I guess the way to put it
would be for those that fear they feel a
little bit defeated for those that are
losing their motivation to vote for
those who felt like he really captured
the moment in a way that Biden maybe
Biden maybe looks a little more
establishment etc you know what do you
say to those students who were really
energized by Sanders and now are feeling
a little bit left out of the game a
little bit unmotivated I get so many
literature Bilitis just by now I have a
forum response literally it's just
impossible to answer boy young people
feel that way and it's it's a very
American sort of reaction you want to
win on your first try that's not the way
things work you take a look at any
social movement abolitionism women's
rights civil rights in the United States
during the late fifties you don't win
everything you make some gains you have
some failures there's some progression
you go on you build from there
now if you take a look at the Sanders
campaign it's a major success a huge
success you think about it for a minute
Sanders completely shifted the range of
questions and topics that are being
thought about and pursued that's very
significant and he instantly helped he
their work
the active and important popular
movements black life mastered matters
occupy environmental movements others
well he sort of was able to kind of more
or less bring them together inspire a
general popular movement these students
who feel defeated came together and they
were very important
they created a basis for real changes
significant ones so one of the most
important is some kind of green New Deal
that's essential for survival you go
back three or four years it was if
mentioned at all was just ridiculed is
ridiculous now it's right in the center
of attention legislative attention with
Biden will be passed in some form how
did that change take place well it was
on the part of the woods that the wave
of activism that Sanders was able to
mobilize and inspire you know the
details the group of young people send
rise movement who were kind of leading a
direct action on this that got to the
point of sitting in and senatorial
offices and congressional offices
Pelosi's office they were supported by
young legislators Alexandria tossing of
Cortes couple of others who would come
into office on the wave of enthusiasm
that was inspired in large measure by
the Sanders campaign and they made it
it's a politia didn't like it nobody
liked it but Kashia Cortes and Ed Markey
senator from Massachusetts were able to
bring forth a major legislation on it
it's not going to be an active Trump and
his gang her back did and we're did but
it can be done and it was done that's
part of the success of the Sanders
campaign
there's something else that people don't
think about much the United States for
well over a century has had deeply
flawed elections turns out you can
predict electability for both Congress
and the present print and the president
with remarkable accuracy just by looking
at one variable campaign spending now we
know where that comes from the very rich
and the corporate sector political
scientists Tom Ferguson wonderful
political scientist has done major work
on this topic extensive Dworkin it's
going right through the 2016 election
incidentally that's very persuasive it's
what he calls the investment theory of
politics of the wealthy and the
corporate sector invest and who's not
all in the state and it works with
remarkable precision Sanders is the
first person to break with that in over
a century didn't have any corporate
support know very little wealthy support
managed of course no media support they
hated them but he managed to come very
close to winning the nomination and he
succeeded in changing the political
tenor extensively that's a real
achievement and lay the groundwork for
going on so I don't think that anything
to be depressed about in the Sanders
campaign it was very successful
the turning to the coming election if
Trump is reelected it could really be a
disaster he'll persist with the policies
he's been pursuing very likely
accelerate them especially as if he
takes Congress with
does that mean they simply take a look
at the most outrageous and destructive
of his programs
defiantly enthusiastically leading the
race to the abyss they will get over the
coronavirus and will be costly
especially in the United States
it'll be costly but they'll be recovery
there's not going to be any recovery
from other things that are going on
right now like the melting of the polar
ice sheets we're not going to recover
from that that's finished and that sets
off we everybody knows with that sets
off a feedback effect by sheets melt
reflective services are gone the dark
water replaces them instead of the sun's
rays being reflected back they're
absorbed the water gets warmer and sea
level rises global warming continues and
this goes on much longer we're toast
that's that's not the only case but it's
one of many cases but this is going to
go to the point where another four years
of Trump that we might pass tipping
points another four years is to trump
this issue might not even arise because
something else is going on
which astonishingly gets almost no
comment Donald Trump is systematically
tearing to shreds the arms control
system which has saved us from nuclear
destruction terminal nuclear war for
decades technical part he abandoned the
INF treaty inter international entered
in the short-range missile program
intermediate-range missile program that
was established by Ronald Reagan and
gorbachev back in 1987 sharply reduced
the threat of war in europe and in order
to make clear what he was doing uh he
and sure this is real psychopath
behavior ensured that there would be a
pentagon test of a missile violating the
treaty just as soon as he withdrew
firmly that's basically an invitation to
adversaries saying you better device
weapons to destroy us that's what he's
saying that's what it means to do it
next on the chuckling clock is the Open
Skies treaty initiated by Eisenhower the
Trump administration doesn't want it
right next is the New START treaty comes
up early next year for renewal that
limits the number of missiles of the
main you know for any country below
above a certain amount Spacek applies in
the united states and russia movies
nobody else is in the same league they
were near the russians novelette or
putin have called for renewing the
treaty trump administration doesn't want
it's getting very close maybe too late
to negotiate a renewal well when that
goes that's all the trees george w bush
had already eliminated the ABM that's
the basic treaty system there aren't
people to notice you or pay attention to
this so then as you know every January
meeting scientists political analysts
get together make an assessment of the
world scene and they kind of encapsulate
the judgment with the Doomsday Clock
it's been going on since 1947 they set
the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock
certain distance from midnight
midnight means nice to know you
good boy we're done
ever since Trump was nominated the
minute had has been slowly moving closer
to midnight reaching last year the point
the closest point hadn't ever reached
this January went beyond that to a new
height in fact the analysts abandoned
minutes they moved to second snow
January it was a hundred seconds to
midnight Trump gets elected I don't know
what they're gonna do that's practically
termination astonishingly
this is almost never discussed I don't
think was ever raised during the
campaign support but as I haven't seen
the media commentators anywhere else
there's some talk about the climate
crisis not very much know we're near
with the RO Toby and here's the fault of
the Democratic Party I should today
they're not interested in any of these
things and Trump's major crimes what
they focus on his things like did Trump
the pressure of foreign government to
harm a leading figure in the Democratic
Party
that's the impeachment proceedings okay
so he did it not nice probably criminal
but it doesn't come anywhere near the
major crimes it's not even not you know
it's just totally different dimensions
but the Democrats don't press it they
also don't talk about they can't talk
about the the way the pandemic was
handled to be for Trump he selectively
ventilators a failure to prepare for the
crisis you can't say that because that's
Bill Clinton who just took over for
Trump from Reagan and expanded
it was Clinton who rammed through the
deregulation of financial institutions
which led pretty directly to the
2007-2008 crisis that is behind this -
he was also waving the neoliberal fly
Obama persistent with it as well so this
is basically bipartisan the Republicans
were more extreme but the Democrats were
following their footsteps so and this
and as far as the core problem of the
lethal aspect of unregulated capitalism
almost nobody was talking about that
well let's turn to the yeah let's turn
to the Sanders campaign it's very
interesting to see the reaction to it
across the spectrum all the way to the
left of the mainstream spectrum most
left us call on this you can find in the
New York Times that have a standard view
they say well it's nice ideas but the
American people are not up to accepting
it so take Medicare for a roll you know
good idea but much too radical for the
American population the same with his
other major plank the free college
education good idea but you couldn't
sell that to the American people you
think about that for a moment that's an
attack on American society and American
culture that you might expect from a
super hostile enemy what they're saying
is the American people are so backward
and so lacking in culture and
understanding that they simply can't
rise to the levels of every other
developed Society all of them have
Universal medical care one for another
almost all of them have free higher
education including the ones with the
most successful educational systems like
Finland always ready to talk Germany and
Norway others in fact even poorer
countries have it right next to us
Mexico a couple of miles from where I
live it's poor country plenty of
problems a very high quality higher
education system lectured in manam major
 universities quite high quality
it's free okay so what the left-wing
critics forget the right the left
critics are saying about American
society is your use president
Trump's term without a fence you're a
 hole country you can no rise to the
level of others that's precisely the
meaning of the criticism of Trump from
the sympathetic part of the spectrum
so-called left part of the spectrum
pretty remarkable when you think about
it but those are Trump's Sanders is main
point and you look at the others it's
basically an extension of the New Deal
you know I don't think he oughta call it
revolution I don't particularly think
you ought to use the word socialist you
have to understand that this country is
way off off the spectrum in many
respects I mean in any other country I
know of the word socialist is kind of
like Democrat yeah even communist is a
plain there's communist parties in the
government nobody bats an eyelash but in
the United States and your curse words
and to try to overcome that you know
presidential election does not seem wise
to me so if you come and say here's my
programs I'm a basically new legal
Democrat
tear them for centuries in fact if you
look at the two Super Tuesday primaries
no word shot into the lead you take a
look at the polls that were taken of
Democratic voters in the Democratic
primaries
most of the large majority said they
preferred Sanders his programs but they
thought he wouldn't be able to put
together a coalition that would defeat
Trump to correctly the major objectives
well they might have been right or wrong
about that but it's interesting to see
the reactions I think these are again
successes of the Sanders campaign maybe
with tactical fissures but large
successes and bringing these policies to
the center of attention
where not only Democrats but a large
part of the population basically
supports we had a large number of
questions about Sanders and Biden but
also a large number of questions about
climate change they all sort of revolve
around the issue of how hopeful you are
I think in previous talks you've had an
interesting way to talk about this if
you were an alien who landed on earth
and you saw what we were doing to
ourselves what would be your reaction
and how hopeful would you be about us
saving ourselves from climate
catastrophe it's just amazing to watch
now first of all we should recognize so
at the level of decision makers the
corporate sector the political class
they all know basically what's happening
it's not a secret
I'm sure to ask Jamie Dimon the CEO of
JPMorgan Chase the biggest the biggest
bank
he knows everything we know but the bank
still pours money into fossil fuel the
production in fact a very interesting
memo the leaked from JPMorgan Chase just
a couple of weeks ago internal memo from
their economists and it's very
interesting it says on our present
course the survival of humanity is at
risk couldn't say it's stronger than
that
and they criticized the banks lending
policies for contributing to this the
survival of humanity is at stake it does
the Trump administration know this can't
be any doubt about it the president
Trump himself is quite aware of it he
has a golf course in Ireland which is is
threatened by rising sea level so he
appealed to the government of Ireland to
build a wall to protect his golf courses
okay yeah he can understand what's
happening when what matters is money in
his pocket it's just this spot to
destroy organized life on earth it's not
his business
no in fact one of the most amazing
documents I have ever seen I can't think
of an analog in history is a document
that came out of the Trump
administration you're to go into
publication of the National
Transportation Administration whatever
their proper title is which did a very
careful environmental assessment
detailed careful assessment couple
hundred pages and they concluded from
their assessment that the temperature by
the end of the century would rise to
about seven degrees Fahrenheit four
degrees Celsius
that's at a level which is considered
catastrophic by scientists and the even
by the World Bank but it'll rise to that
level and they drew a conclusion from
that we should not impose further
restrictions on auto emissions yeah
that's very rational conclusion within a
certain framework thinking says look
we're going off the cliff anyway so why
not have fun that's what it means
can you think of anything like that in
history I mean maybe the closest
analogue I can think of is the Nazis von
C declaration 1942 when they basically
agreed to slaughter all the Jews and 30
million Slavs the Roma of the gypsies
and conquer much of the world pretty
awful but they didn't say let's destroy
all of civilization because we can make
more money that way tomorrow that's
unique to the Trump administration some
coverage of it is reported in the
Washington Post but let's turn to
another topic so going back to your head
and coming to look at this they think
I'm saying in fact I have a sort of
farcical solution to the famous Fermi
paradox and astrophysics there's Enrico
Fermi great physicist posed the paradox
he said look we can demonstrate that
there's huge numbers of planets all over
the universe who have the capacity that
the circumstances in which higher
intelligence can develop so how come
we're not hearing anything from there's
been a huge search for signals
well one possible answer is that they're
out there and they're observing what
happens on earth and they say we don't
want to get anywhere near that place
[Music]
that would be a rational response and
the few key decision as to whether this
correct is in the hands of your students
current generation they're going to have
to make the most awesome decision in
human history never arisen before is
organized human life going to persist on
earth and not in the distant future that
decision can't be avoided and it's in
their hands another thing that's kind of
shocking is the grete Thunderbird for
Alderman go back to the you know every
January in Davos Switzerland the people
who are called the Masters in the
universe gather for enjoying themselves
skiing talking snowman CEOs of major
corporations media leaders that kind of
class and this January there were two
main speakers one was Donald Trump of
course the other was a seventeen year
old girl
Greta thumb Berg you just compare those
two speeches that is shocking they ought
to be played side by side in every
classroom in the country every other
place where there's anybody interested
in understanding the world on the one
hand you have Trump they're ranting away
about how great he is the best person
I've ever lived
all kind of nuts you know it's just
embarrassing nonsense then comes this
young girl who gives a quiet factual
accurate speech on what's happening in
the world and ends up by saying you
the bigger audience are destroying our
lives okay put those side-by-side and
it's very interesting to see the
reaction of the Davis crowd they don't
like Trump because of his vulgarity
which interferes with the self-image
that they have and the image they're
trying to project you know a dedicated
humanists really civilized people asking
the world just put your fate in our
hands and you're fine cuz we're such
nicer civilized guys the Trump Trump's
vulgarity and offensiveness undercuts
that nevertheless they gave him a huge
rousing applause now because they
understand something they know that yeah
he may be a vulgar thug or at least
acting like one but he knows very well
what pockets you're supposed to pour
dollars into and how to do it now that's
his main program all the rest is you
know rhetoric to try to keep the masses
under control to be amplified by Fox
News but the legislative program simply
stabs everyone in the back and pours
money into the pockets of the rich in
the corporate sector so therefore he
gets cheered with Greta thumbr get was
polite applause you know you're a nice
little girl we like you go back to
school that's what the alien would see
and it's a it's a question are we oh we
gonna allow this world to persist the
coronavirus is going to be very severe
it will be recovering there already is
in some countries will be facing the
question what kind of world do we want
after you recovered from this below
that's a decision that has to be made
and it's in the hands of younger people
it's scandalous but true that it's the
younger people who were in the forefront
of working intensively to try to
overcome the serious crises that we're
facing they can say to the older
generation you're betraying us but the
older generation doesn't answer speaking
of the younger generation I had a number
of questions submitted to me privately
about Social Security right after the
most recent tax cut you're probably
aware that many politicians turned
around and said well you know to make up
the difference the deficit we're going
to now cut a variety of programs Social
Security being one of them it's hard to
convince young people that Social
Security is not actually broken it's
only broken if we don't choose to to fix
it
that'd be my perspective anyway what
what is your perspective on whether it's
broken or not and and what the true
problems are with Social Security and
John whether you want to keep the
collection of gangsters in power though
they were very frank about it you're
right
the ones who crafted the tax cut for the
rich were very frank Paul Ryan L Speaker
Mitch McConnell after they gave the
wealthy and the corporate sector an
enormous gift and created a big deficit
instantly they said well you know now we
have this debt that we have to deal with
so we'll cut away at things that
important to people okay straight very
frank nice of them to say it and if
that's the way you want the world to
work yes
Social Security will be declined in one
way or another maybe even privatize the
way most of them want so that the
investor class can make some money off
it but does that have to happen not at
all Social Security's in pretty good
shape little tweaks in the system could
make it workers on the head as you can
predict I mean remember that the tax
that pays for Social Security is highly
regressive it has a cat and by today's
standards the cap is pretty low raise
the cap a little so slightly wealthier
people would contribute okay that cuts
away at the deficit or it can be funded
by the federal budget now you take a
look at social justice social welfare
measures internationally including
social including not only Social
Security but unemployment insurance is
child care goal for after them the OECD
countries the rich countries roughly 30
are carefully studied by this these
measures the United States ranks way at
the bottom it ranks next to countries
like Greece and Mexico it's poor
countries you have to make it better but
the wealthy countries are too far better
on all of these measures that's not a
law of nature that has to do with the
priorities of those who run the country
okay if we let them do it yeah that's
what's going to happen and notice that
this is a very severe problem right now
Social Security is working but taking
unemployment insurance that's normal
it's going to run out pretty soon
not in other countries where it's
permanent you know but here where it's
limited and they're in mind that many
workers don't have employment insurance
it's only for those who have regular
jobs with fixed employers but they also
have health care and they are they think
they like their health care the polls
among people you know employed by major
corporations visiting we learn to in
shape because we have these nice health
care plans what they don't realize is
that the employers are not paying for
that they're paying for it it's taken
out of their wages it's called the later
late it's called the labor cost on the
accounting books so if the employers
weren't providing the health insurance
their wages would you low so they're
paying for it you know many people think
well I'm getting this neat health
insurance that my employers are paying
for so I don't want bright pay higher
taxes for the you know further Medicare
it's a joke they're paying extensively
for their own health insurance it's not
small that averages I think to about
thirteen thousand dollars a year on
average for a working person it's more
changing but Americans are so have such
it has been instilled into them that
taxes are a horror but when you pay
twice as much to a private corporation
that's great okay it's true as the
charges against universal health care or
the taxes will go up yeah and everything
else will go down much much further but
if you give money to the the picture is
Reagan kind of symbolized it but the
general picture is the government is
this foreign institution has nothing to
do with us now they're coming to steal
their money
in fact the attitude towards taxes is a
very interesting measure of the nature
of the Demick
democratic system so just do a thought
experiment think of the two extremes
suppose you're in totalitarian state
pure tutela Terran state the state tells
you I'm going to steal this amount of
money from you every April 15th okay
then you can have the mantra death or
taxes can't get away with it now imagine
a Democratic Society hard to imagine but
imagine one where people get together
that decide what they want for the next
year from their community for their
society how it should be funded then
passed the legislation when April 15th
comes they dance around the Maypole we
decided what we wanted and now we're
implementing it it's great let's have a
party that where does the United States
stand on that spectrum well if you think
about it for a minute you can see how
functional our democracies we like to
praise ourselves as the leading
democracy you think about it people
think of it as almost a totalitarian
state death of taxes is a good example
of that and that's critical to the
Medicare for all you know a universal
health care debate I mean you know I
lived in Massachusetts most of my life
liberal state they were regularly
referenda on whether they should have
universal health care from Massachusetts
when the referendum is instituted very
high support then comes the business
propagande if we have that your taxes
are going to shoot to the sky what we're
hearing about the Sanders plan though
and I gradually has these hammers away
and support for it goes down you don't
want to pay the high taxes
and result is the referendums defeated
that what it actually means is that the
expenses out of your pocket will be much
less if the lancet estimate that I
mentioned is a good example but you
won't be paying it to that awful
government that foreign institution you
will be paying it to a nice corporation
which sometimes called soulful
corporations have your interest I mean
that's a kind of a you know kind of an
instilled common sense which is part of
the reason for what is really a pretty
sick Society in many ways and that all
of these things have to be addressed
somehow if we want especially right now
we're at a point where we are a new
world is going to take shape and if it's
going to be run formulated by the Davos
men we know what it's going to look like
we'll be harsher and more brutal than
today but it doesn't have to be can be
formulated by people that want a decent
humane world actually on Medicare for
all it's worth remembering that the
United States does have universal health
care it's not usually recognized but we
do have it if you don't have any
insurance and you have you know
something you know you broke your arm or
you you have a high fever you can get
medical paper it's called emergency
rooms if you go to the emergency room
they are legally required to take care
of you that is the most cruel savage and
expensive form of Medicare of universal
health care that you can imagine but we
have okay
is that the world we want you go to the
emergency room in one of the major
hospitals the Mass General say best
hospitals in the country standing with
people who could be taken care of by a
nurse if we had any kind of preventive
or adequate just ordinary health care
can't do it talk to an ambulance driver
some of these that's done it they'll
tell you that maybe 80% of their
ambulance calls are from people who have
some problem but they can't get to a
doctor so they get anything : ambulance
go to New York no I mean there is a kind
of a health care system but it is so
broken that it's hard to describe and
those are choices it's not a necessity
other countries don't work like that I
want to let you go on time and that way
you'll agree to do this again for us in
the future but with the with the
remaining 60 seconds that folks are
willing to hang on with us there's been
a lot of anxiety in the questions in the
chat bubble and there's been a lot of
anxiety and the emails that I've gotten
from folks these are a lot of young
people who are very energized but are
are feeling a bit defeatist can you give
us a hopeful message to leave on your
getting some company somebody wants into
this conversation yeah there's a lot to
be hopeful about let me just you should
it's worth thinking about what the world
was like a few years ago so go back to
say the 1960s ancient history the United
States had federal laws requiring that
federal support for housing
Keeble african-americans
the federal government was saying you're
an african-american you can't go to live
at them these news accounts that are
being built up its weight only the
Liberal Democrats voted for that though
they disliked it because there was no
other way to get anything funded for
public housing if it wasn't segregated
they'd never get the Southern Democrats
to join well that was the country then
it had patty miscegenation laws that
were so extreme that the Nazis refused
to accept them when they were looking
for models for their own racist laws
women were not legally regarded as peers
still the old you know Blackstone was
that the fountain of founders for
trained property not peers that didn't
happen till 1975 environment that I
forget it's not an issue there was a war
raging in there's a terrible war worst
crime since the Second World War
overwhelming supports were may recall to
try to I was very involved in the
anti-war movement even in Boston liberal
City it was impossible to have public
demonstrations even meetings in churches
because they'd be attacked by students
and others who were saying we you know
you call me rats we get out of here
country is very different now radically
different it didn't happen by some gift
from above it hasn't because of the
activism most of these young very
courageous people Freedom Riders from
snick went off into rural Alabama facing
great danger
sometimes being killed - just to try to
encourage black farmers to fake
the wrath of the authorities and other
citizens and tests of it okay
finally they want not didn't win
everything by any means and the current
reactionary Supreme Court is trying to
reverse the situation to what it was
that's what it meant when they cancelled
the Voting Rights Act level states to
impose harsh restrictions of any kind
they want to keep out the wrong people
that's court doesn't have to be like
that you can change it but victories
have been won by struggle the sunrise
movement which I mentioned won a major
victory okay these are all reasons for
hope you look around the world today the
corona virus is causing great damage
everywhere but you're seeing some pretty
inspiring examples that ought to give
hope we mentioned the nurses and doctors
credible courage dedication tells you
what humans are capable of but look
around poor communities and there's
mutual aid groups forming ways of trying
to help people who like food and take
care of the elderly who can't get out of
their homes and so on sometimes it's
almost astonishing what's happening so
in Brazil the president happens to be a
clone of Trump
two of them are vying to see who could
be the most disgraceful figure in the
world seen know he's he says he's in
total denial it's just the cold
Brazilians don't get fires and so on
it's leading to fortunately a lot of
Governors and local officials are not
paying any attention to them but it's a
terrible situation there's extreme
poverty in Brazil the favelas the slums
and Rio are miserable places there's
just no way for social distance if you
make most people don't even have water
how can you wash your hands and but
there are groups forming to try to
develop local groups not to try to
impose whatever measures can be taken in
those conditions to reduce the threat
you know who they are the crime gangs
that rule and terrify that terrorize the
ghettos they're doing okay actually
that's a sign for hope
that says that people can organize to
try to help one another instead of just
trying to kick the other guy in the face
actually at the international level
we're seeing a pretty dramatic example
of that so there's something called the
European Union okay and right now it's
showing us just how much of a union it
is so take Germany the major economy
looks wealthy economy they're doing
pretty well for themselves but great
nextdoor stone's throw away it's the
major center of the epidemic in Europe
Lombardy northern Italy is Germany
helping them know we just helped
ourselves we've been a warning for you
unfortunately Italy can turn for help
across the Atlantic to Cuba Cuba is
again illustrating true internationalism
selfless internationalism will send
doctors who will work in the most
dangerous places they would the help of
China which is providing materials and
also sending doctors so there is some
genuine internationalism where where is
it coming from not the United States
Germany
from Cuba it's not the first time Cuba
played an extraordinary role in the
liberation of Africa that's why as soon
as Nelson Mandela was free the first
thing he said was praised for Castro and
the Cubans we would help liberate Africa
was costly for them myself but they
didn't know there's a huge earthquake in
Pakistan causing enormous damage doctors
do come from Cuba okay
they look at the health care system in
Cuba it's a poorer country being crushed
under the US jackboot ever since Kennedy
you walk around Havana there's small
clinics all over where people can come
for basic problems if a woman is has a
baby the doctor in the clinic goes to
visit regularly to make sure
everything's okay though they have a
tiny fraction of the healthcare costs in
the United States better statistics I
mean there are things that are possible
okay you have to do that so is that a
sign of hope yeah says very good things
are happening we can join we can make
good things happen here
and it has been done in the past very
often some of the things that have been
done in the United States have no
parallel in the history of in all of
history so during the 1980s for example
you don't read about these things in
newspapers they don't want you to know
about but in the 1980s it's not very far
back the Reagan administration was
carrying out massive terrorist
atrocities in Central America
sometimes just using invading armies
sometimes using the state security
forces which we funded and directed and
the organized to carry a massive
atrocities and terrorism there was a
reaction from Americans for the first
time in the history of imperialism ever
thousands of Americans went to try to
help the victims to live with them
nobody ever thought of going to a visit
to live in a Vietnamese village or an
Algerian village never came to anybody's
mind but it was happening in the Aging's
and this was rural treasures in rural
America you know over the country -
tremendous example of selfless
internationalism in our own country
should be a beacon to the world and a
model for all of us it's not far away
it's right here ok we can do those
things those are all reasons for hope
oh no I want to thank you very very much
you can't hear it but you're getting
thunderous applause from many individual
computers all across Pennsylvania so
thank you very much and we hope to see
you soon
glad to hear that your back is getting
better and hopefully things are on on
the right track thank you
