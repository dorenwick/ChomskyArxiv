the five pillars of mad monolith
production
assalamu alaikum brothers
sisters friends and the foes out there
welcome to another episode of the blood
brothers podcast with your host dili
hussain
today's guest is a living legend
and that is by no stretch of the marlin
exaggeration
he is a celebrated and a rude an
esteemed
academic political thinker an analyst an
expert in linguistics
um his accolades are much longer than
santa's list
but i can't know justice in this mere
introduction
he is none other than professor noam
chomsky chris chomsky welcome to the
blood brothers podcast
very pleased to be with you thank you
very much for giving us your time in
your very busy schedule sir
oh yes interviews all morning today
now just before i proceed with today's
podcast
uh it is a norm within the islamic
tradition
that when we address those who
are our seniors whether it be by age or
by knowledge
we don't call them by their first name
are you okay with me calling you
professor chomsky
absolutely fantastic wicked right let me
set the tone
uh for today's podcast i want you to
imagine that you are on a boat ride
uh preston chomsky uh it's a seven day
boat ride
and you need to take along with you some
companions to keep you company in this
boat ride so i'm going to mention to you
two individuals you have to pick one of
the two individuals
exactly one let's go
plato or aristotle to join you on the
spot right
yes well that's hard they were quite
different
i guess i'd pick aristotle
okay his contributions my wife doesn't
like it
she said i should have picked plato
lesser
that's right between the two of us okay
prophet jesus or prophet muhammad
jesus or muhammad
i can't make that choice once you get to
that level there's no choices
emmanuel kant or frederick nietzsche
john stuart mill or john locke
john walk karl marx or adam smith
that they're so different it's hard to
choose
i would probably say marx
lenin or trotsky
no not particularly enthusiastic about
either of them but trotsky
okay michael for colt or
jean-francois lightheart
sorry i couldn't hear can you say them
again
for cult or light leotard
or jean francois leotard
l esposito i'd say
but i'm biased because he was a very
close friend
norman finkelstein or jordan peterson
that's not even a question
julian assange or edward snowden
both are
i can't really choose they're both very
important in different ways
and julian assange as you know they're
both punished
snowden's punished by what's probably
permanent exile
assange is being brutally tortured
right now as he has been for seven years
and is
facing probable life in prison
last but not least bernie sanders
or jeremy corbyn
well i highly respect both of them
sanders i suspect but not so much
because of his
policies but because of his
ability to weather harsh
condemnation and efforts but repression
directed at both of them corbin is a
too nice a person not a fighter
he didn't fight back sanders
okay well it's interesting to know how
that seven-day boat journey would have
been with all these individuals
thank you for uh for your for your
responses
um there are so many topics professor
chomsky which
our viewership and our listeners would
have wanted for me to discuss with you
today there's so many things
um the arab-israel conflict the
palestinian resistance
in light of ongoing israeli aggression
american imperialism
so many things so many things our
viewers and listeners would have liked
for me to discuss with you but today i
have chosen the topic of
the nation state now
the reason why i have chosen the topic
of the nation state
is because within many islamic
muslim intellectual circles there is a
lot of discussion and has been for the
last century
that the nation state is a polity
which has been imposed on the developing
world the muslim majority world
via colonialism and in fact that the
polity of a nation state is distinctly
european
how true is this professor chomsky
well the nation state is a fairly recent
development
it's not purely european japan is a
nation-state
but for most of the world it's
been imposed by european imperialism
take a look at the borders of what are
called countries in africa
they often straight lines they have
almost nothing to do with the
populations take say iraq
iraq was welded together
by the british as part of the
british french imperialist effort to
organize the middle east so
iraq just a second i have to get rid of
the dog which is
nice it's absolutely fine down just
down down down just
down it's wicked okay
see they're all kind of problems nation
states and dogs
so the nation just i mean it takes to
iraq i started to talk about
it put together groups that
a variety of tribes had nothing to do
with each other that sometimes didn't
even speak the same language
it was done for the purposes of british
imperialism
so the british wanted the oil fields in
the north
so they incorporated them in iraq
could have just well gone into turkey if
power
structures had been different uh the
british wanted to ensure
that the new country that the country of
iraq that they were forming
would not have too much independence so
they wanted to block its
easy access to the gulf so therefore
they created the principality
of kuwait carved it out figuring that
can be under british control
and it'll keep iraq from getting
easy easy access to the gulf for its own
development
similar things all over the world
assyria
take the levant syria lebanon palestine
those borsig borders are almost totally
meaningless
actually so that myself 70 years ago
i happened to be spent some time working
in a kibbutz in israel as a
college student and i went hiking once
in the
northern galilee a young person does
and as i was hiking along one evening a
jeep
pulled up behind me and guy got out of
the jeep and started
yelling to me he said come back in
hebrew
and i came back asked him what's the
problem he said you're in lebanon
there was no border wall of course it's
bristling with armaments but then it's
just one
continuous area the galilee you know
it doesn't make sense to put a border
and take a look elsewhere in the world
it's the same
right now i'm living in arizona
not too far from the mexican border
why am i in the united states and not in
mexico
well it's because uh
in the mid 19th century the united
states
launched a war against mexico an
aggressive war
no pretext
general grant who was president later
just fought in the war said it was the
most
wicked war in history uh just
in order to conquer texas arizona
but most of the west california
partly in the hope of turning it into
slave states so they could
enslave more blacks in the most hideous
system of slavery in
history so now i'm now in arizona not in
mexico
sometimes when i'm giving it talks i
call it occupied mexico
wow what it is and you look around the
world that's what the borders are
europe itself was the most
violent place in the world for centuries
well the countries the various
factions religious groups other
groupings in europe tried to establish
national borders
the only reason actually the main reason
there hasn't been
another war since 1945
is that uh western
science reached the point where it
devised
the means to destroy everything so the
next time you
france and germany continue with their
favorite sport of slaughtering each
other everything's going to be wiped out
okay that's the way nation states were
established we could say the same all
around the world but they're there
you can't eliminate them and getting rid
of them has its own problems
uh the major problems we face in the
world
are global international
and we face problems of global warming
serious maybe lethal
problem of environmental catastrophe
global
pandemic global elimination of nuclear
weapons which is crucial for survival
global so all of these problems have to
be handled on an
international scale on the other hand
under existing social arrangements
when too much power is taken
away from the nation and placed in an
international organization
it can have harmful effects we see that
in europe
one of the serious problems in europe is
that the european union as it was
designed
had both positive and negative
features among the positive features
were the schengen agreement which allow
people to travel freely from one
european country to another to
work in some other country and so on
that's a generally
positive feature one of the negative
features
is that major decisions
were taken out of the hands of national
government and placed in the hands of an
unelected bureaucracy in brussels
yeah called troika an elected
european commission uh the
european central bank office unelected
international monetary fund not elected
that's the troika sitting in brussels
they make them at major decisions to
which countries have to adhere
it's been a very unfortunate situation
it's led to sharp deterioration in
democratic functioning it's part of the
reason for the
anger you know resentment that you see
all over europe the rise of uh extremist
right-wing parties are trying to
capitalize this and so on
there are others trying to counter it so
there is a
transnational european organization
the m25 it's called
initiated by giannis vorofakis
former greek finance minister very fine
economist
this is a transnational organization in
europe
running candidates and elections and so
on
trying to save the parts of the european
union
that makes sense and are beneficial and
trying to remedy and overcome
the parts that are very harmful like
what i described
yeah planning similar problems
everywhere
i mean the african organization of
africans
the uh of african union could be an
organization that deals with
regional problems in a helpful and
sensible way
and sometimes tries to be actually
very if you look at the cases they're
very revealing
so take the nato invasion of libya
initiated by france britain went along
then the united states joined
it's destroyed libya turned libya
where libya was a you know plenty of
problems but it was a
wealthy functioning society
devastated now in the hands of warring
militias tearing it to shreds
uh outpouring of arms tuarek
tribes which had control of their arms
or sending them all over africa to
overthrow governments the mali
government recently
why because of the nato invasion well
the organ of the oau
at the beginning had proposals sensible
proposals for negotiation mediation
settlement of the conflict could have
worked
would have been very healthy not only
for libya but for all of africa
but they were blocked the nato powers
wanted to get in and take control
themselves and bomb
doing their thing they're famous for
bombing and destroying
okay libya is a wreck large parts of
africa are a wreck
this is not ancient history this has
been going on for a thousand years
i mean i i mean it takes me nicely into
the next question i wanted to ask
it's a prevalent argument there's a
prevalent argument that the nation state
has been a far more successful project
in the western world namely europe
canada
the united states australia new zealand
that these countries these
aforementioned regions you know they
have far more
successful examples and manifestations
of the nation state
but specifically talking towards the
demographic of our listeners and viewers
when you look towards the middle east
and north africa
or parts of south asia you know there's
all this
this argument the developing world
whether it's democracy but we're talking
specifically about nation state
how true do you think that statement is
do you think the nation-state model has
been more successful
in the western world then let's say
middle east and north africa
or the muslim majority world well
depends what you mean by successful
how would we measure success how do we
measure success of a nation state
let's take the success of the nation
states okay
the most powerful nation state is the
united states by far
yeah how did the united states become a
powerful state
by violent aggression from its first
moment
there's a lot of talk about in the
united states today about how we're
involved in endless
wars we have to get out of the endless
wars
they're referring to afghanistan
somalia those aren't the endless wars
the endless war started in 1783
when the united states was founded one
of the reasons
main reasons for the american revolution
was that the british uh put a
bound on expansion of the colonies
wouldn't let them expand visa beyond the
appalachian mountains eastern range of
mountains
the country beyond was in the hands of
the indian
nations they were nations indian nations
the colonists didn't want that they
wanted to conquer
destroy and exterminate them and steal
their lands okay
the united states has been at war
virtually
every year since its founding
through the 19th century the wars were
the british were kicked out finally so
that barrier was
gone they immediately started invading
the nations the indian nations
wars of extermination literally in fact
the term extermination was used
destroyed them almost entirely now the
remnants are confined to
reservations near me for example it was
an indian reservation
very poor that's the was
that included in the invasion of mexico
which uh conquered
half of mexico that's the southwest and
the west
okay for whom is that a success
and success for the conquerors it's not
a success for the vanquish
absolutely that's true almost everywhere
you look let's go to the
most powerful the most probably the most
efficient
western capitalist state germany and
germany was put together pretty recently
and germany became a nation in the 19th
century
conquest as the prussians managed to
extend their power
has germany been a success since
was germany a success during my
childhood
when hitler took power no
that was it a success for whom for the
conquerors
for for the desperate for hitler and the
nazis it was a success for them
well this question of success
just it's too complicated you can't say
yes or no
now let's go back to the middle east and
north africa
for a thousand years
the north that includes russia the north
and the west
have been fighting a war against islam
which is most of the global self there's
a wonderful book about
it by a great historian friend of mine
william polk who just died very recently
it's called
crusaders and jihadis that's about the
thousand-year
war of the north which of course
includes russia that's how
the small muscovy uh
which has been carrying out a war
against the muslim world for
also for almost a thousand years well
okay when you're colonized
and destroyed it's very hard to have
efficient nation states
all right you go back to the late
mid 19th century western africa
was in approximately the same state of
development
as japan uh good historians have written
about this
hazel davidson or the great african
historians
also african historians themselves
written about it
it was a it was unifying it was
developing
it was wealthy could have gone on
forward
about the same state as japan there was
one
fundamental difference between them
africa was colonized
japan was the one part of the global
south
that was not colonized and it's the one
part that has
what we call a successful nation state
is that just accident you know the
history you know it's not
accident it's not it's the effect of
successful
european nation states which destroyed
africa
okay and blocked effort and development
same in the middle east region
i don't have to run through the history
for you you know very well
of course when they're under uh
there have been many efforts in say in
egypt
to try to free themselves from western
colonial rule early 1920s
nasser our spring all crushed
not destroyed there's plenty left that
can build on
but beaten down actually if you look at
egypt and the united states
take egypt in the united states to
compare them sounds ridiculous
in the 1820s to compare them was
very realistic they were very similar
both egypt and the united states were
developing
societies they both had
ample resources of cotton cotton was the
oil of the early industrial revolution
that's what made it work the basis for
manufacturing for finance for retail all
through the 19th century
egypt had all of it the united states
had a lot of it
very different conditions the united
states had it
under a vicious brutal system of slavery
the worst in human history egypt it was
peasants in a quasi-feudal society
both were developing a national
project egypt and muhammad ali
as the united states under the
hamiltonian model of independent
development
well why are they different
because of primarily because of a
country called england
england colonies in the united states
had freed themselves from british rule
the egyptians hadn't britain still
controlled
the eastern mediterranean had extensive
control over egypt
palmerston leading british statesman
very clear and said so that he would
never allow an independent egypt
france joined in as well egypt was a
rich agricultural country
that's why napoleon conquered it because
of its rich agricultural resources
that could have developed the difference
was the same as between
west africa and japan so the development
of some
meant the crushing of others okay and
that's
continued as i said in the early 20s
it was an egyptian attempt to free
themselves from
british domination it was beaten down
case of nassar
it was a war a 1967 war
which essentially crushed there was a
war
between radical islam
centered in saudi arabia secular
nationalism
centered in egypt in fact they were
literally at war
recall there was a war in the yemen with
mostly proxy forces but a lot of the
egyptian army was there
67 came along a western
settler colonial society israel
had the technological military resources
uh to just to tilt the balance in favor
of radical islam
against secular nationalism the united
states like
britain before has tended pretty
consistently
to support radical islam as opposed to
secular nationalism
continues right at this moment it's part
of the reason why
you may have seen a comical report this
morning
saying that some right-wing
norwegian uh parliamentarian
and nominated donald trump for the nobel
prize
yeah yeah i did that's quite comical
okay that's supporting
radical islam against secular nationally
wouldn't it i mean professor professor
chomsky wouldn't it be fair to say
if we look at the likes of uh if we look
at the likes of hosni mubarak
if we look at some of the most despotic
arab regimes
they never claimed to be of the radical
islam
spectrum they were ardent secular
secularists if you look at the likes of
hosni mubarak or if we look at
ben ali of tunisia if we looked at
um you know of other dictators which the
west
namely america have favored um they
do it they have tended to have been
secular secularists
well to mixture and sometimes the
secular forces turned into harsh
dictatorships
which the united states supported other
times they've
been they've been taken over
by radical islam saudi arabia
gulf family dictatorships uae
those are the base for u.s power they're
the ones that you would strongly support
against secular nationalists of the
nasser type
okay are you suggesting then that
america
namely america has it is the leading
superpower
one could still argue and that is quite
indifferent
to who the proxy state is that whether
it's quote unquote radical islam
or con or conservative types of saudi
arabia or the secular type of hosni
mubarak and ben ali
that america so long as its hegemony is
in place and intact
it's quite it's quite indifferent as to
who it favors
all they have to do is be subordinate to
u.s power
okay we can have any regime they want
but it's been the case
typically britain is will the tech
internationalism has
often been more of an opposing force
to imperial power than radical islam has
been
a radical islam goes off in its own
direction
when the term radical islam is used it's
a spectrum isn't it
on the one hand you have al-qaeda and
isis
and on the same spectrum you'll have the
muslim brotherhood
right so just for the sake of clarity
when you're referring to radical islam
what exactly are you referring to
what i'm referring to is the fact that i
said to be
what i said at the beginning is that the
united states
like england before it has tended
to support radical islam against
secular nationalism
for that secular nationalism by and
large
has been more independent and
has attempted to move out of the control
of
western power tended it's not a hundred
percent
so let's take al-qaeda united states
supported them
helped create them in fact in the 1980s
uh when it was uh overthrowing when it
was uh
uh trying to defeat russia
the goal of supporting al-qaeda was not
that the united states supported radical
islam
so they wanted as they put it officially
to kill russians that was the official
goal for the support for the us effort
to bring together radical islamic groups
from
all over the world including what turned
into al qaeda
in afghanistan for the official purpose
of
killing russian soldiers
that was the directive that came
from the cia headquarters
in islamabad from the head of the the
guy who was running the operations
so yes they supported radical islam but
not because they liked radical islam
because it was serving a global
purpose the same with supporting saudi
arabia
happens that's where all the oil is
as long as they're a pillar of u.s
policy in the region
the uss i just want to get your thoughts
on the following examples
how would you then respond to the
taliban
in afghanistan or the akp in turkey
or the freedom and justice party under
um the muslim brotherhood in egypt
where there has been various examples
where
conservative quote-unquote islamist
parties or governments have posed
some concern to the us and and the west
sometimes when they are subordinate to
u.s power
they're fine when they oppose u.s power
they're wrong same with the secular
groups
but that's why i stress the word
tendency
there is a long-term tendency
for the secular nationalist groups to
become
more independent that's been true
throughout the whole period of british
imperialism
which is why the british tended to
support them and it's been true mostly
during the period when the u.s took it
over
right now happens to be a very mixed
complex moment
with all sort of different forces but
that has been the tendency throughout
the pure world and it's led
it's been it's set the basis for a
matter of which is much of what is
happening
okay 67 war was crucial
in the development of arab nationalism
nasser was you know not saying i'm in
love with nassar a lot of
plenty of criticism plenty of things to
criticize but he was
the symbol and the center of rising
arab nationalism made an effort to
get together with syrian secular
nationalism
that broke down could have picked up
again egypt's an influential force in
the
muslim world it was stopped by the 67
war and a victory for saudi arabia
with you of course
in fact the that war changed lots of
things
not just for arab nationalism which was
a serious blow
but also for us israeli relations
and before that u.s israeli relations
have been
reasonably close but not unusual
international fears
after 67 they become something totally
different in their
israel relationship is unique
other israels so you're saying this
so you're saying the six day war of 1967
was a significant turning point
for it for u.s israeli relations totally
changed u.s policy
not only in policy enormous support for
israel
but in fact not only the six-day war but
also
the next event of the crushing of black
september
in 1970 there was a
struggle in jordan as you remember
the jordanian regime was crushing the
palestinians
syria made some moves to
try to protect the palestinians from
destruction that the united states could
not
intervene at the time it was all tied up
in indochina
and the country was in flames over the
indo-china war u.s could not intervene
israel intervened it's performed a great
service to the united states
mobilized troops uh compelled syria to
back off
that was a great another great uh
contribution to u.s power just as the 67
war was us aids israel
quadrupled at that point in response to
israel's
service to u.s power then a system was
established
to control the region based on
what are called three pillars saudi
arabia
iran iran was of course under the shah
and
israel they were theoretically
at war but that was pure theory
in fact they were very closely
integrated
the relations between israel and the
shah
became completely public
shocking everyone with their intensity
after
god was overthrown very probably
everybody in the
top israeli political echelon traveled
up and back to tehran
under the shah they were technically a
war all kinds of close relations
developed
the israeli saudi relations were more
subtle just as they are between
have been between uh israel and the
united arab emirates for many years they
shared many goals they had some
interactions but
theoretically they were at war that was
the
basis for u.s power in the region and it
relied primarily notice that
it was both a radical islamic state
saudi arabia and a secular state
iran but they were both subordinate to
u.s power
so it was okay interesting uh professor
chomsky when you travel
the breadth of the muslim world all the
way from morocco
to indonesia as north as chechnya to
asaph as tanzania
millions of muslims still positively
talk about
the notion of a caliphate a caliphate
which was part of islamic history for
nearly for
the best part of 1400 years it was a
polity which
muslims believe was left to them by the
prophet muhammad
and of course the word caliphate let's
put isis aside let's put al-qaeda aside
let's put these kind of groups aside
it is no it is not unheard of to go any
part of the muslim world today
and you will find many many people
fondly talking about
a caliphate where why cannot arab states
or muslim states
come together like the europeans have or
like other
countries have as as regional powers
what is why can't the muslims have a
caliphate if we wanted one
via you know if this was something which
reflected
our cultural religious uh you know
values and morals and so forth
and obviously one of the biggest
propaganda message of the war on terror
was the emergence of a caliphate
so i want to ask you how real of a
threat
was the notion of a caliphate to the u.s
of the u.s right now there's actually
one contender
for that position erdogan
that's clearly what he's aiming at he
wants to restore something like the
ottoman empire
with the center in istanbul
and him being the successor of the
call of duty but the obstacles to that
are
pretty obvious can we can we hit
can we hear some of the what are the
obstacles can we hear it
what are some of the obstacles well take
a look at libya
where turkish and gulf arab
forces are fighting each other with
proxies
saudi arabia gulf dictatorships are
obvious obstacles it's not
obviously not going to bring in iran
it's uh the nationalist forces are
opposed to it the international forces
are opposed to it
but let's think for a moment about the
ottoman empire
the last time there was a caliber yeah
and
it was very brutal in many ways plenty
of things wrong with it
but there were also some positive
aspects to it
there were so for example in the levant
yeah people were pretty much left alone
the greeks could run their affairs the
armenians would run their affairs
sunni group could run their affairs they
are partly out of incompetence partly
because of
lack of power the situation was
fairly fluid on the ground which pretty
much
fit the nature of the societies
and remember under the you could travel
from uh cairo uh to baghdad
to constantinople without crossing any
borders
you didn't need a password space one
complex web
day yeah i mean i mean professor chomsky
it's interesting that you mentioned this
if you go to if you speak to people
who are 80 90 plus who are still alive
and the stories they heard from their
grandparents i'm talking about
the levant i'm talking about
you know parts of the muslim world which
was under ottoman rule
they'll say that yes the ottomans were
not perfect they weren't perfect
they had their many issues but it was a
far better successful model in terms of
amalgamating and establishing some
relative peace than the nation-states
that followed after its destruction
um and i and and and many muslims find
it unfortunate i myself as
a graduate of politics a journalist by
profession
is of concern that when we even
not romanticized or nostalgia but when
you talk about
real facts and that is that the ottomans
managed to keep
peace and stability in a region which
now after its destruction has been
marred by war and invasion an occupation
and it's a sentiment which millions of
muslims have
do you feel that it's understandable why
many muslims would have that sentiment
when they look back at ottoman the
ottoman period and compare it to the
situation
of the middle east and north africa over
the last 90 years
well i think the picture that you're
describing
from people my age incidentally
so something i can remember is partially
romanticized it wasn't that pretty but
there's a lot of truth to it
it is true that the complex
mosaic of cultures uh
societies that constitutes the region
was left pretty much in place you could
move from one place to another you could
control
your own local affairs pretty well
now that i think makes sense i've long
believed
that we should be moving
take the israel-palestine conflict
i think the only real hope for any
sensible solution for that is within the
framework of a
regional integration which
uh softens and erodes the national
borders
that were imposed by imperial power
remember the borders
are all artificial when i
crossed into lebanon 70 years ago
i was crossing an artificial border at
that point it wasn't even marked uh
and that's not that far from the time
that these people you're talking about
were
thinking about and that's what it should
go back to
this doesn't make any these these lines
in the
on the border make no sense from the
point of view the people living there
they were imposed by imperial force for
the benefit of the imperial powers
and that region mostly france and
britain and it's causing enormous
difficulties
you can groups that don't belong
together fighting each other
troops that do belong together blocked
by borders
i mean it's an unnatural system how
unnatural it is we can see from the
history of europe
remember that it took centuries of
violent
bloody murderous conflict for those
borders to be
for the nation-states of europe to be
established
they didn't just come like that i mean
30 years war in the
17th century killed about a third of the
population of germany
what's now germany okay
was it peaceful two world wars
weren't peaceful those were the efforts
to establish the borders of
what are now european states and in fact
very quickly sensibly after the
last great mutual slaughter europe began
to move towards somewhat eroding
those borders which are not natural
borders
none of them are like neither the one
that's
a couple of miles south of me that's not
a natural border either
it's imposed by imperial violence
okay and they should be eroded but we do
want what was more positive about the
ottoman empire
namely the local independence and
freedom
and the absence of artificial boundaries
that's the favorable part kind of like
the schengen agreement in europe
the favorable part of the european union
there's also
highly negative parts like the
centralization of power
out of popular control color would be
another form of that
so i don't think all of these systems
have
elements that are worth pursuing other
elements that
should be abandoned and eliminated
but we shouldn't live under the illusion
that the
nation state was some natural state of
human beings
it's a recent development created by
horrendous war and violence and it
doesn't answer to people's needs
