good
evening and welcome to Burlington City
Hall a scene of many exciting
Adventures uh during the last couple of
years uh we have had a number
of prominent and important spokespeople
uh come to Burlington
Vermont and tonight we're very proud to
welcome n
trony from
MIT who has been a very vocal and
important
voice in the wilderness of intellectual
life in
America uh at a time when many
intellectuals and active magicians find
it more comfortable to be
silent and to go with the flow as it
were it is confident to find on occasion
individuals who have the guts to speak
out uh about the import
uh issues of our time and certainly
Professor chsky has been a person to do
it I am particularly delighted to
welcome here to city hall because one of
the things that we are trying to do in
Burlington is to do away with this gap
between what happens up there on the
hill and what happens down here or what
presumably happens in Washington
regarding Nicaragua and what happens
here in local government we have the
belief here that local government is
everything that affects human life and
last night I was very proud that the
board of Oldman by an 8 to3 vote
approved the resolution supporting
opposition to president rego's in
Reagan's imgo to
nicaragu and our point of view was that
what happens in Nicaragua what happens
in
Washington what is done in the name of
the United States of America was done in
all of our names and it is absolutely a
local issue so without saying more uh
without going any longer I am delighted
to welcome uh a person uh who I think
we're very all very proud of Professor n
tronsky
[Applause]
[Applause]
the United States is quite unusual among
industrial democracies in a number of
respects uh one of them one of the most
obvious uh simply has to do with the uh
ordinary political participation so for
example as as measured say in voting in
uh presidential elections the United
States is remarkably low among
comparable Societies in the level of
political participation and a more
interesting feature of that is the
following if you look at the non-voters
in the United States they're
socioeconomically identifiable pretty
well uh they are essentially the kind of
people who in some European society
would vote for one of the labor-based
parties uh either labor or socialist or
communist all of which are essentially
kind of reformist labor-based parties
that have a labor constituency and work
for them in one fashion or another by
and large those people don't vote here
uh among the unemployed for example in
the last election only a third voted uh
and if you uh look at the statistics you
find this quite General and it's been
going on for a long time uh well
evidently those people regard themselves
as disenfranchised they don't see any
point in voting for what amounts to one
of the two uh branches of the Tory party
uh there being none that uh is that has
them as its constituency there are other
respects in which one finds this kind of
particularity of the United States so
for example just a couple of days ago
there was an article in the Boston Globe
my hometown where uh they referred to
Howard Zin an old friend of mine there
was an article about him and the way he
was censored at the bu uh and it
referred to him there as an avowed
socialist kind of with a gasp you know
as sort of like an avowed murderer or
something he actually says it and so on
well again in Europe that would just be
comical you know you couldn't refer to
anybody as an avowed socialist as if
that were something surprising or in the
media in the United States uh as far as
I know there isn't a single columnist or
reporter for that matter uh who either
would identify himself as sort of a main
mainstream socialist or if he would
would be willing to allow it to be known
and again in Europe that's just
inconceivable it's
unimaginable uh the all all of this
reflects a kind of an ideological
uniformity and rigidity in the United
States which is striking and is a kind
of a counterpart to the uh to the lack
of to the absence in the political
system of any uh of any uh organization
that represents uh the interests of poor
or disadvantaged or working people uh
one of the best young scholars of
American political history mat Tom
Ferguson has pointed out in a recent
very important study of American
political history that political parties
in the United States are I'm quoting now
blocks of major investors who coales to
advanc candidates uh representing their
interests the real market for political
parties is not voters but rather major
investors who generally have good and
clear reasons for investing to control
the state and correspondingly uh in
federal elections people either lots of
people who interests are not those of
those coal groups of investors either
don't vote or also if you look at they
also tend to vote contrary to their
interests contrary to their political
commitments as U uh many detailed
Studies have shown so for for example in
the last election of Reagan voters uh
who were a small minority of the
electorate about 2/3 uh said that they
hoped that his policies weren't enacted
uh what that uh that uh mean that
reflects a kind of rational
understanding of the political system uh
it reflects the understanding that uh
the choices are sort of uh between
pepsicola and Coca-Cola you're
effectively disenfranchised anyway so
you might as well vote for the guy who
makes feel good the policies are not
going to change all that much maybe
that's a bit of an exaggeration but it
reflects a certain perception and
understanding of of political reality
well these are some of many indications
of uh what is in fact a rather striking
uh striking property striking fact about
the United States namely again
differentiating it from other similar
Societies in the United States there's
an extraordinarily High degree of class
Consciousness on the part of the
privileged classes on the part of
business uh professionals uh the uh
Elite in intellectuals who associate
themselves with privilege and Power in
those groups there's a very high
unusually high degree of class
Consciousness which manifests itself in
lots of ways and correspondingly there's
an unusually low degree of class
Consciousness on the part of of working
people uh a good deal about the United
States reflects that that phenomenon
which does Mark this country out uh to a
considerable extent as distinct from
from other similar societies well one
particular manifestation of this uh of
this phenomenon is is the public
relations industry which again is a
peculiarly American phenomenon it exists
elsewhere but nowhere on the scale that
it does here uh this goes way back in
the United States in the early part of
the 20th century it was beginning to
become significant in 1909 an AT&T
executive uh commented that the public
mind is the only serous danger
confronting the company and uh the pr
this the the pr industry public
relations industry was in fact created
in order to control this threat to
control the public mind and prevent it
from being a threat to major
corporations during the first World War
the government got into the ACT uh the
the the government uh created the first
major official propaganda agency called
the Creo commission its purpose was to
try to to uh drive a General generally
pacifistic population uh into into the
European War uh the head of the cre
commission referred to this as the
World's Greatest Adventure in
advertising uh and the uh a lesson was
learned the lesson that was Learned was
that uh The Government Can in fact
control the framework of discussion by
flooding the media with so-called facts
amounting to official information and
also by defining the issues uh that are
allowed to be discussed so by those
means and and once that if that can be
done effectively it really doesn't
matter what the outcome of debate is uh
if you can Define the issues uh As You
Wish you've essentially won the battle
and that lesson was learned during the
war one of the one of the major members
of the Creo commission was a man named
Edward Beres who uh learned the lesson
well he became the essentially the
patron saint of the modern public
relations industry its leading figure
years later uh he wrote about what he
called the engineering of consent which
he described as the essence of democracy
the power to persuade now he didn't go
into the question of who has the power
to persuade the answer is pretty obvious
it's the people who own and manage the
society but it's a conception of
democracy which is very significant in
the United States the essence of
democracy is the power to persuade which
is in the hands of those who essentially
own and manage the private economy and
that defines what democracy is uh long
before that in fact shortly after the
first world war Walder Lipman uh the
major American journalist had recognized
the same point uh partly because of the
experiences of the first world war he uh
discussed in 1921 what he called the
manufacturer of consent which he said is
an art uh that will cause a revolution
in the practice of democracy uh this
idea was taken up with great enthusiasm
in the social sciences uh one of the
leading American political scientists
Harold lasswell that's very influential
wrote an article in the encyclopedia of
social science in 1933 on propaganda in
which he sort of gave all of this a
theoretical basis uh he made a
distinction between Democratic societies
and what we nowadays we didn't use the
term then would call totalitarian States
and he pointed out that uh propaganda
has a very different function in those
two kinds of societies in a totalitarian
state or a military society and so on
propaganda isn't all that important
because the state can control Behavior
by force but in a Democratic Society
where the state is restricted in its
ability to use Force against citizens at
least relatively privileged citizens who
have means to defend themselves uh in
such a society propaganda becomes much
more important he pointed out and the
reason is that the voice of the people
is heard and therefore it's necessary to
ensure that that voice says the right
things uh that that voice says the
things that the leadership regards as
correct in a totalitarian society that
doesn't matter so much uh because
they're going to do what they want
anyway and if you don't like it you'll
suffer but in a in a the more democratic
a society is the more indoctrination is
needed the more you need manufacturer of
consent and uh lasswell went on to say
that we should not succumb to what he
called Democratic dogmatisms such as the
idea that people are the best judges of
their own interests that's not true uh
despite Mass education and so on people
have no idea what their best interests
are the only people who understand their
best interests are the privileged Elites
and since we have this unfortunate
phenomenon of democracy uh we have to
make sure that privileged Elites are not
uh restricted in their ability to carry
through the policies that are in fact in
the interest of everyone uh which means
you have to have an effective system of
indoctrination you have to have real
manufacturer of consent uh he went on to
he said that we should regard we
shouldn't regard propaganda negatively
he said propaganda is completely neutral
he said it's as neutral as a pump handle
you can use it for good or for evil and
since of course we're good we're going
to use propaganda for good purposes and
therefore we should have a positive
attitude uh towards it it's again the
essence of democracy well uh this is a
all of this is familiar in another
context this is all a typical leninist
ideal uh the leninist concept is that
the Vanguard party which uh represents
and understands the interests of uh of
the work class uh should lead because
the workers are just too stupid to
understand what their own interests are
so therefore the Vanguard party which
will take control uh on the basis of
their revolutionary activity will lead
them uh because it understands you know
what's right and so on and so forth and
in fact the relationship between
leninist Concepts and the uh the liberal
intelligency in the west is extremely
close there's the very similar
managerial concept of uh control and
indoctrination and I think this goes
part of the way towards explaining why
it's what a certain phenomenon which has
been very common over the years namely
the very sudden and Rapid shift from
party loyalist to West American jingoist
this happens over and over again and I
think the reason it's so easy is it
doesn't really require much of a change
in political conception it re really
requires a change in estimate as to
where the future is really a kind of a
change in in choice of Masters uh more
than a change of ideas uh
well what I want to talk about tonight
is how all of this there's a lot to say
about this but I wanted drop at the
general talk there and talk about how
this works out in practice and I want to
let me take two current examples and if
there's time go into some others because
there are many uh one example I want to
discuss is the recent uh uh Spate of
Vietnam retrospectives uh that have
appeared in all the media in the last
couple of couple of weeks uh
commemorating or I guess uh uh what the
right word is maybe commiserating over
the the last the 10th anniversary of of
the departure of American troops from
Vietnam and the second case I want to
discuss is current situation in Central
America which in many ways is strikingly
similar remarkably similar to what was
going on in Vietnam in the early 1960s
and that has lessons there one of the
consequences of the disparity in class
Consciousness that is the high level of
class Consciousness among privileged
Elites and the very low level of class
Consciousness among everyone else one of
the consequences of that is that
privileged Elites are able to learn from
history and improve their performance
whereas the rest of the rest of us don't
uh because we don't learn from history
and we don't have the resources to even
discover what it was and in fact it's
essentially eliminated down the memory
Hole uh given the control over resources
and I think it's important to try to
overcome that so I will try to draw some
parallels between these two situations
as I'm sure they're being drawn in in
Washington too well let's begin with the
Vietnam retrospectives uh but let me
begin first by stepping back a bit and
trying out a uh kind of a thought
experiment you know imaginary situation
uh let's imagine that the Soviet Union
after many years of fighting uh leaves
Afghanistan as incidentally they say
they will do if what they call
neutrality is guaranteed there so
suppose in fact they leave Afghanistan
and suppose 10 years after that uh they
have retrospective accounts in the party
press
what would we expect to find there and
what would we expect to be omitted well
I think that's pretty easy what we'd
expect to find is a focus on the
terrorism and violence of the uh of the
uh Rebels and there'd be plenty to say
about that and we'd also expect to find
a focus on the misery and suffering and
repression uh in the period after the
Soviet Union withdrew and there'd be
plenty of that too when you destroy a
society there's going to be plenty of
suffering and mostly the brutal most
brutal elements Will Survive and take
over uh so there'd be lots of talk about
that and lots of wailing and shedding
tears and so on uh there would uh also
be talk about the noble cause of the uh
Soviet Union which came to the defense
of the legitimate government of
Afghanistan against uh terrorist Bandits
organized by the CIA and so on and so
forth uh some things would also be
omitted uh one thing that would be sure
to be omitted from these retrospective
accounts would be the actual war that is
what actually happened you know what
were the military operations what did
they do to people and so on
and another thing that would be omitted
certainly would be the planning that lay
behind the war you know with the reasons
for it the things that led the Soviet
Union into it well that's the end of the
thought experiment now let's turn to the
real world uh and we can be rather brief
because what I've just described is
exactly what we've seen in the last
month the the American Media behaved
exactly in the way we would expect the
well- disciplined uh party press to
behave in the Soviet Union or any other
totalitarian state uh a number of things
were in fact exactly the ones I
described and a number of things were
focused on exactly the ones I described
let's look a little more carefully one
thing that was omitted virtually totally
in the media was the war against South
Vietnam American in fact there it isn't
even known in the United States that
there was an American war against South
Vietnam the only thing that exists in
American history is the American defense
of South Vietnam that's our way of
referring to the fact that we attacked
and practically destroyed South Vietnam
I'll come back to that later uh but the
actual not only uh was was it is the
concept missing but there was no
description of it so if you read time
Newsweek New York Times Wall Street
Journal you know down the list uh you'll
find strikingly missing the actual war
no description of the ground operations
of the bombing and so on and so forth
the only exception that I saw in a
review of all the media on this was uh
two pages in Newsweek by Ron Moro and
Tony Clifton which in fact referred to
the fact that there was a war there and
described some of its consequences so
that was missing another thing that was
missing was any discussion of the
background planning for the war the
reasons why the United States got into
it there's a ton of documentation on
this this is a very open society and we
have plenty of access to high level
planning documents and there's a it's
it's very well understood in fact if you
want to bother understanding what led
the United States into the war but that
was missing down the memory hole not a
mention of it not I I didn't even see a
word of that what you found instead was
something different what you read was uh
that uh the war was uh a mistake but a
noble mistake that it was uh ucer it was
a failed Crusade undertaken with the
loftiest intentions these incidentally
are the phrases used by Stanley Carno in
the uh best selling companion volume to
the PBS television series which is uh uh
highly praised or criticized for its
critical cander and which in fact is now
the subject of a right-wing attack which
will soon be aired because it was only
obedient to this party line and not
sufficiently servile to it so there we
read that we started with the loftiest
intentions and failed Crusade no
evidence is given to testify that no
evidence is offered to suggest that we
had lofty intentions or anything else
that's just party line I mean you don't
need evidence for that or you read that
we entered because of I'm quoting now
blundering efforts to do good although
this became a disaster by
1969 that's Anthony Lewis who is I think
the harshest CR critic of the war in the
American press or you read that uh we
entered in an excess of righteousness
and disinterested benevolence uh uh and
that our defense of South Vietnam was
badly conceived that's John King
Fairbank uh who's the leading American
Asia scholar and about the harshest
critic of the war in American foreign
policy you could find in in anything
close to mainstream academic circles and
on and on like that uh you'll notice
that everybody's been quoting as a
these are all the critics of American
policy the spectrum of opinion extends
from them you know from the idea that we
entered in an excess of righteousness
and disinterested benevolence over to
Norman portz and Ronald Reagan that's
the Spectrum if you got a magnifying
glass you can actually see that there's
something in between and that's that's
important it's very important to notice
that this is what the critics say and
it's also important to notice that none
of this has to be justified that is
nobody who puts forth these views gives
any evidence for it or feels that any
evidence is required
that reflects an extremely
extraordinarily High degree of success
in manufacturer of consent and
indoctrination you don't even recognize
that there's an alternative a
conceivable alternative to the party
line it's not just that you adopt the
party line it's inconceivable that there
could be any alternative to it so
therefore you don't have to give an
argument well that's the critics uh and
all of this illustrates rather well
these uh conceptions of the differences
between democracy and totalitarianism
that I mentioned before uh in it's
necessary in a democracy to have a level
of control over thought so in so
extensive that it is impossible even to
imagine that there could be an
alternative to the party line that
thought has to be entirely constrained
within the spectrum of the critics who I
just mentioned and and the right and
that's very different from a
totalitarian state in a totalitarian
state typically you have a kind of a
Ministry of Truth which produces the
truth and everybody identify it you know
where it's coming from it's coming from
the government uh and you you have to
obey uh the extent to which there
there's often a cost for Disobedience
how costly it is depends on the violence
of the state so for example in the
Soviet Union if you disobey uh you can
be you might be ignored but if not you
could be sent for psychiatric torture or
uh prison or Exile under Grim conditions
or something like that in a typical
American dependency like El Salvador uh
what'll happen is you'll end up in a
ditch with your head cut off after
hideous torture uh and States vary you
know on the level of violence that they
use that's us that's them uh uh but it's
always dangerous in a democracy
typically that doesn't happen uh you
don't have a Ministry of Truth which
presents the party line which you can
then this totalitarian system in a
certain sense leaves you free internally
free you don't really have to believe it
you can identify it you have to you
can't there's there's a danger in
departing from it openly but you can
essentially believe whatever you want uh
in a democratic system that's not true
you can't believe whatever you want it's
dangerous if you believe whatever you
want uh because they can't do to you
what they do to you in El Salvador uh
therefore you better only think the
right thoughts and therefore all thought
has to be constrain so we get the result
that I just described and that was
typical throughout the U throughout the
war there was uh it's kind of intriguing
to see how it worked there was of course
a debate over the war during in the 60s
in mainstream circles that debate was
between people called Hawks and people
called doves uh the Hawks were people
like for example journalist Joseph ala
who held that if the United States used
sufficient degree of violence it could
win the war and the doves were people
like Arthur Schlesinger was described as
an anti-war leader and kind of a leading
Dove and his view was that no matter
even if we used extensive violence we
probably wouldn't win although he went
on to say I'm quoting now that we all
pray that Mr alsa will be right and if
the American government does succeed he
said we will all be praising the wisdom
and statesmanship of the American
government uh in reducing Vietnam to
what he called a land of Ruin and wreck
now that's the dove position uh if you
read and that's not very far in the past
read today's editorials about El
Salvador and that's exactly what the
liberal press is saying they're saying
well looks like we can reduce the land
to ruin and wreck and Massacre enough
people so that we'll win so therefore we
should all be praising the wisdom and
states ship with the government that's
the critic's position as it's been in
the past now between those two positions
the doves and the Hawks you're allowed
to have a debate in fact the better the
more vigorous the debate the better the
propaganda system likes it because the
more vigorous the debate the more deeply
you instill the unstated principles
which are of course that the United
States has the right to use force and
violence to achieve its ends and the
only uh the only question that can be
raised about this is whether it will
succeed at a sufficient uh at a low
enough cost now again in a in a
totalitarian system you could never put
forth that principle uh it would be too
crude uh but in a democratic system
again you don't say it openly but it's
presupposed by the debate and the idea
is that uh that's supposed to and it
often does instill the principle so the
ordinary person on the outside uh will
say well you know if even the critics
assume this who am I to question it uh
and uh in fact it's the critics who play
the major role in a democratic system of
thought control in in ensuring that the
manufacturer of consent works that's
incidentally why they're tolerated in
fact honored they play a major role my
own view is that if dictators were
smarter they would use our system uh I
think it they don't understand the
benefits of a lively exciting debate uh
between positions which assume the same
principles and appear to be uh at
opposite ends because they differ
tactically with regard to how well those
principles can be enacted that's a very
effective technique of thought control
one that's been honed to a high art in
the United States as part of our general
PR system well let me say that uh here
we have to enter some qualifications
while this propaganda system worked like
a dream among the educated classes uh it
didn't work all that well among the
population at large and that shows up it
shows up uh in polls for example uh so
for as recently as 1982 which is the
latest one I saw uh the gallop Poole uh
asked the question at have poll you know
they're the United States a heavily
pulled country not for our information
but because business likes to monitor
public attitudes for all sorts of
reasons sometimes we also hear about it
uh and the they have polls on
International Affairs uh and uh one in
1982 they asked the question do you
think that the Vietnam War was a mistake
or was it I'm quoting now fundamentally
wrong and immoral well of the general
population 72% said it was fundamentally
wrong and immoral uh many fewer opin
so-called opinion leaders held that
position that includes clergy and so on
and among articulate intellectuals
virtually nobody ever held that position
uh even at the height of opposition to
the war the number of people who felt
that it was something other than a
mistake that aggression is wrong in
other words was minuscule among the
educated classes Uh there's Big split in
other words between the attitude of the
general population on this issue and the
attitude of the educat classes uh that
split even has a name it's called the
Vietnam syndrome uh the term the
terminology is interesting syndrome is a
term you used for a disease right and
the Vietnam syndrome is a kind of a
disease that spread over the population
namely uh the discipline began to break
down not among the educated they are at
held they held the line uh but among the
general population discipline began to
break down and this disease spread with
really terrifying symptoms such as a
refusal to follow orders or raising
questions about
what the state is doing or uh even worse
something like say sympathy for victims
of American violence and feelings of
solidarity with them and so on that's a
disease that has to be overcome it's not
a disease that was ever widespread or
even particularly noticeable among
privileged or educated groups uh but it
did spread among the population uh and
this distinction incidentally is not
unique to this case in many cases you
find that the educated parts of the
population are the most extensively
indoctrinated the ones who understand
least about the world uh and the ones
who believe most fervently the
principles of the faith and that's not
surprising either if you think about it
educated people are subjected to much
more intensive indoctrination well
that's what education is uh and you know
they are the ones that who who suffer
from it they're its victims but also
they have a kind of class interest in
believing it because their social role
is to be the purveyors of of propaganda
so therefore it's necessary to kind of
internalize it and believe it and if you
don't do that you sort of were
marginalized and eliminated from the
intellectual class so it's not too
surprising that among the educated you
find the least understanding uh and uh
the most uh profound indoctrination the
inability for example even to conceive
that there could be an alternative to
the party line on issues such as those I
discussed well let me turn now to the uh
things that are omitted in this
discussion uh there are two major things
that were omitted in the retrospectives
the first is is the background planning
and here let me generalize it uh because
in fact there is underlying the American
war in Vietnam that you wouldn't know it
from the media from most books there was
a very well-worked out geopolitical
conception which didn't only apply to
Vietnam but applies worldwide uh my own
feeling is if you understand this
geopolitical conception a lot of what
happens in the world will fall into
place now and in the future and if you
don't understand it most of what's going
on in the world is going to look like a
total mystery uh and just kind of
wandering around random from blunder to
blunder or something like that uh but uh
uh the and you can even get a pretty
good uh reputation as a profit if you
get to understand what the underlying
thinking is uh and it's again well
documented though you got to search to
find the documents they're not you know
they're suppressed in effect uh the uh
the the main this this I mean it goes
way back but I start from the second
world war which represented a
qualitative change the United States
emerged from the second world war in a
position of global power that had very
few counterpart probably no counterpart
in history uh I doubt if there' ever
been a time in history when any single
power uh had such a degree of world
domination in terms of control over
wealth in terms of military power and so
on and uh going back to what I said
before American Elites are very class
conscious very self-conscious they
understood this they plan uh and they
prepared they uh worked out how the
postwar world should be how it should be
run and organized so as to conform to uh
their interests in a world that they
expected to rule and dominate to an
extent without historical precedent from
1939 to 1945 there were a long series of
meetings run by the Council on Foreign
Relations which is the major business
input into policy planning and the state
department it included all top planners
in the state department this is called
the war piece studies group and they
were essentially planning the post-war
world uh by 1943 or so it was pretty
obvious how it was going to come out uh
and uh they developed a concept which
they called the Grand area the grand
area was to be a region subordinated to
the needs of the American economy as one
planner put it it was a region
strategically necessary for World
control and the grand area was to
include as a minimum the entire Western
Hemisphere uh the Far East and the
former British Empire which we were in
the process of taking over during the
war that's incidentally something called
anti-imperialism in American uh history
writing uh and it was also to include
Western Europe and the oil producing
regions of the Middle East and in fact
everything if possible but at least that
much that was the Grand area which was
to be supported subordinated to the
needs of the American economy and rather
detailed plans were laid for particular
regions in the grand area I'll come back
to some of them uh the thinking behind
all of this was explained very lucidly
by one of the most important American
political thinkers and planners of the
period namely George Kennan he's
interesting for one thing because he's
smart uh and he says things clearly and
accurately he's also interesting for the
same reason that the critics I quoted
before are interesting he's at an at the
end of the spectrum he's at the Humane
liberal doish end of the spectrum and
he's also very lucid so his conception
soort of aforor everything hold it holds
for everyone else worse in other words
so here's what you hear at the liberal
end of the Spectrum in this period this
is George Kennan uh
uh in February 1948 happens to be the
top secret document that I'm quoting
from uh paraphrasing I'm not actually
quoting he says there that uh he he
starts by pointing out that the United
States has 50% of the world's wealth but
only 6.3% of the world's population this
disparity he says causes envy and
resentment uh the major goal of our
foreign policy must be to maintain the
disparity now to maintain the disparity
it's going was going to require harsh me
meur es we therefore should put aside
what he called vague and idealistic
slogans such as quoting now human rights
raising of the living standards and
democratization and be prepared to use
harsh measures the less we're hamper
hampered by idealistic slogans the
better we should put aside all ideas
about world benefaction and altruism and
be ready to use Force if necessary
that's the message uh that's the way you
maintain the disparity well that was the
planning from the liberal side uh let me
make a comment on that first when he
talks about the disparity between the
United States and the rest of the world
there's something hidden of course the
United States doesn't mean the people of
the United States uh there's actually a
comparable disparity internal to the
United States and that must be
maintained too although we didn't bother
to say that because this is foreign
policy but internal to the United States
there's also a disparity which has to be
maintained and for that you also need
harsh measures uh and in fact the
planners recognized throughout that if
the United States move towards a more
egalitarian society something which is
obviously not contemplated or
conceivable uh then it would be not it
would not be necessary to have a global
order subordinated to the needs of the
American economy there were other kinds
of Arrangements that would be possible
uh without such uh Primacy given to what
we ought to call the freedom to Rob uh
if uh if if you didn't have to maintain
the internal disparity but of course
that was not in question that's also
discussed extensively well that was
Canon as a gen that that document
actually happened to refer to the Far
East but the United States is a global
power and the same ideas were developed
for other regions continuing with Kenan
uh in the case of Latin America the
other area I want to talk about uh Kenan
explained in a briefing to Latin
American ambassadors that uh uh he
explained that uh the a prime goal of
our foreign policy must be what he
called the protection of our raw
materials notice no mincing of words
here protection of our raw materials and
protection of our raw materials means
protection against the indigenous
population because they're the only ones
that are going to take them we' already
kicked out the British and the Russians
are only there to frighten the domestic
population but the real enemy is the
indigenous population uh and we got to
protect their raw materials from them
and to do so he said again harsh
measures will be necessary we should not
uh refrain from police measures if
necessary he said it's better to have a
harsh government in power than a
government that's liberal and relaxed
and tolerant of what you called
Communists well here the term Communists
has a very special meaning in American
political theology it refers to people
whatever their political commitments who
are committed to taking stealing our
resources that is to using them for uh
domestic needs they're communist by
definition uh and doesn't matter what
they believe they believe New Deal
capitalist or whatever uh but they're
communist uh and those are the people
against whom we have to use harsh
measures including police measures which
makes some sense if we have to protect
their resources and maintain the
disparity as the prime element in our
foreign policy uh well uh that's Latin
America uh incidentally the what kenon
may very well have had in mind was a
state department intelligence report
that had come out just a year earlier
which warned of a rather dangerous
doctrine that was spreading over much of
the world including Latin America namely
the belief
that I'm quoting now that governments
have a responsibility for the welfare of
their people now that's communism in our
terms and obviously that has to be
stopped because if governments arise
that have a responsibility for the
welfare of their people they don't have
a corresponding responsibility for our
welfare and that's obviously the
Transcendent need if you have to protect
our raw materials and uh uh maintain the
disparity well that's Latin America with
regard to Asia the geopolitical picture
that was developed was that sooner or
later Japan was going to be
reconstituted as the industrial
Heartland of Asia uh Japan is a resource
poor area and also needs markets
therefore the in order to ensure that
the United that Japan this industrial
society remains essentially within
American control it would be necessary
to provide Japan with uh resources and
raw materials which meant primarily
South and Southeast Asia so in This
Global remember these are Global
planners they're not playing for small
stakes in the global planning that was
developed the United States was
going to have to ensure that a
reindustrialize Japan operating within
the framework of American power would
have access to resources and raw
materials in particular in Southeast
Asia that's in fact directly the
thinking that led us behind uh into the
Vietnam War now let me turn to what was
that that's the omitted geopolitical
conception that's never discussed none
of this is ever discussed in the
planning docu in the retrospectives OR
in fact almost anywhere in American
history except unless you go to sort of
technical monographs that you are sure
that only a small number of people are
going to read or something uh and let me
say that I've just barely touch the
surface this goes on to quite detailed
and explicit planning pursuing these
basic ideas and about the way it expect
well now let's turn to the omitted
history the history that was down the
memory hole in these
retrospectives remember what happened
let's remind ourselves of that starting
around 1948 the United States recognized
explicitly all of this all of this in
secret documents in public of course you
don't talk about things like this like
no president gets up to the public and
says uh look folks we have to rob the
rest of the world in order to maintain
the disparity between us and Them
meaning between the rich here and them
uh meanwhile keeping you guys down where
you belong to uh and we're going to have
to use Force to do that presidents don't
say that what they talk about is our
Noble objectives and our lofty
intentions and so on and the
well-disciplined intellectuals repeat
that stuff for them that's what the
media are about and what the schools and
universities are about and so on but
this is now the real world well now
let's look at the history in the real
world also secret I mean the events are
not but the documents are uh by 1948 the
state department had recognized
explicitly that the Nationalist movement
of Indochina was led by hoochi Min and
the Viet men the anti- French Resistance
uh and they recognized that there is
really no alternative there's no
expedient short of alternative that
could be concocted however they also
recognized that that's un acceptable the
reason it's unacceptable is that a
nationalist movement in Vietnam under
the leadership of the vietn men might
very well be successful in Social and
economic development and if it were
successful then uh that invokes a
certain Theory which we call sometimes
the Domino Theory but actually to be
historically accurate we really to call
it the rotten apple Theory because
that's the image that's constantly used
uh the idea is that one rotten apple in
the barrel May infect the whole Barrel
that is if one country undertakes
successful social and economic
development independent of the United
States other countries might try to do
the same thing people next across the
border is going to say why not us you
know and then the rot May spread as the
planners put it if you think I'm kidding
you to read the documents the rot of
Social and economic de development that
would be success as Kissinger put it in
with regard to aende the in the the uh
the contagion May spread and infect
other regions these disease metaphors
are very commonly used used and you can
see why and it's really frightening that
people are stealing our resources all
over the place uh and uh so so according
to the rotten apple theory if you which
then became you know the Domino Theory
if uh uh if there is successful social
and economic development although
Vietnam isn't all that important the
right to Rob Vietnam was not all that
important though Eisenhower made all
sorts of speeches about tin and tungston
and so on but mainly it wasn't that the
problem was that the rock might spread
and therefore the the sort of cancerous
growth had to be stopped at its source
uh so we therefore uh supported the
French in their effort to reconquer
their former colony and by the end of
that war which was 1954 when the French
pulled out we were providing about 80%
of the costs uh that was a very serious
War about half a million people half a
million Vietnamese died during that
period uh well that was 1954 the French
pulled out we came rather close to using
nuclear weapons at that time the United
States was really intent on preventing
the rot from spreading the French pulled
out there was a political settlement the
United States moved in blocked the
political settlement uh installed in
South Vietnam the kind of government
that we're very familiar within our
history we installed a typical Latin
American Terror and torture State the
kind we have a lot of practice with and
it immediately blocked the political
settlement but it also turned to the
task of massacring the domestic
population again that's what we know
about from our own history uh the
government that we installed uh killed
off about 70,000 or 880,000 people by
about 1960 which is again not a small
number uh this had the the uh had the
effect that it often has namely it
aroused resistance kind of an odd
phenomenon that nobody understands and
that of course proved that the Russians
are coming as it also always does uh by
1960 when Kennedy 61 when Kennedy came
in there was a problem the government
that we had established which everybody
in Washington knew had no popular base
was collapsing because now there was
resistance after this massacre uh and
what were we going to do so what Kennedy
did and this is instructive what Kennedy
did was simply to attack South Vietnam
in 1961 and 62 the American Air Force
was sent to bomb South Vietnam no
subterfuges American planes from the
American Air Force started extensive
bombing and defoliation in South Vietnam
this was part of a broad program
intended to drive several million people
maybe up to 7 million people or so into
concentration camps which we call
strategic hamlets where they would be
surrounded by barbed wire and armed
guards and as we put it protected from
the gorillas who as we conceded they
were willingly supporting well that was
that program when any other country does
that we call it aggression that's like
what the Russians are doing in
Afghanistan but when we do it it's
defense in fact the extent you know the
extent of the um cility of the liberal
intelligen on this is kind of remarkable
for example Arthur Schlesinger again the
anti-war leader and let me keep to the
critics because they're by far the more
interesting uh Schlesinger has a book
about this period uh called a thousand
days history of the Kennedy
administration and he talks about the
year 1962 when this attack began he says
1962 was not a bad year he says
aggression was checked in Vietnam
meaning the aggression of the Vietnamese
against us was checked by our attack
against South Vietnam that's what
happened in 1962 but as that gets
filtered into party history its
aggression is checked in South Vietnam
this was explained rather nicely by
another hero of the liberal Pantheon
adlay Stevenson at the United Nations uh
he said that in Vietnam we are engaged
in defense against what he called
internal aggression it's a lovely
orwellian concept or well wasn't smart
enough to dream it up we're defending
ourselves against the internal
aggression of the Vietnamese in Vietnam
as we do in many parts of the world well
uh that was the early 60s meanwhile the
Kennedy then the Johnson Administration
continued the war extended the war
against South Vietnam they overthrew
Government after government because they
couldn't find anyone who was
sufficiently enthusiastic to support our
escalation of the war against the South
uh they blocked every political
settlement they blocked neutralization
they also understood exactly what they
were doing nothing about lofty
intentions or you know benevolence or
anything like this they understood
exactly what they were doing it's
explained very well by government
Scholars for example Douglas Pike who
was the leading government scholar on
the vietcom and who writes about wrote
at the time about this period that it
was obviously impossible to accept the
political settlement because he said we
could not expect our Mino to compete
politically with their whale well
obviously you can't have a political
settlement if they have a whale and we
have a minnow can't have democracy under
those circumstances so we and we
couldn't nourish the whale it was minnow
so we had to do is destroy the whale so
therefore we had to attack South Vietnam
no lofly intentions nothing else this is
just ordinary consequences of the
canones geopolitical thoughts that I
described well that takes us to about
1965 by 1965 the United States had
killed off about 160,000 people or more
in South Vietnam those are not small
numbers uh give some comparisons later
if you like but they do they compare
with Paul pot for instance uh the real
facts uh that's before we got into the
war officially about 160,000 were killed
in 1965 uh the government was again
collapsing we had we had to carry out an
extensive land invasion of South Vietnam
uh we also started started the the
systematic bomb we had then been bombing
South Vietnam for about 3 years but
that's when the systematic bom
bombardment began like B52 bombings in
the makeon Delta and so on uh we also
attacked the north at that time uh the
period from 65 to 75 I won't go into
anymore the United States extended the
war also to Laos and Cambodia the total
casualties during that period are
probably in the neighborhood of about 3
million in Vietnam and maybe 3/4 of a
million or so in or maybe close to a
million in Laos and Cambodia
well you add it all up it comes to about
5 million casualties which is a lot the
land was ravaged uh the societies were
destroyed particularly in South Vietnam
where the popular movements were wiped
out uh it the there are millions and
millions of refugees uh the uh by 1970 I
should say it was pretty obvious that
the end result was going to be either
just you know total annihilation of the
place or else a North Vietnamese
takeover that's what I myself wrote In
1970 that it would end up with the North
Vietnamese takeover for the very simple
reason that every other indigenous
Society was destroyed so there' be
nothing left except the North Vietnamese
that's pretty much what happened 5 years
later and that consequence of American
savagery is now used as a retrospective
justification for it see look the North
Vietnamese have taken over we were right
to destroy South Vietnam uh that's again
a propaganda operation that Geral would
have admired but it's intriguing to
notice that it goes on in the media with
no comment you know nobody can comment
on it well again that tells us something
the end result of all of this is that
the United States won a partial Victory
this is called a defeat in Vietnam but
that's because they misunder one thing
that all the media retrospectives agreed
on was that the United States was
defeated they say that's indubitable it
happens to be untrue in fact virtually
anything that stated as undub in the
propaganda system is probably false
that's a good rule of thumb and this is
one such thing the United States wasn't
defeated and couldn't be defeated a
country this powerful can't be defeated
it can only be partially defeated and we
won major objective uh namely the rotten
apple Theory isn't going to work you
know the chances that Vietnam will be a
model of Social and economic development
for anybody else are very low they'll be
lucky to survive after this assault and
that's a very significant Victory when
you think about what the real reasons
were not the lofty intentions and so on
which are you know to pacify the
population but the real thinking that's
a victory and we've been ensuring it
ever since uh the post-war American
policy is designed to guarantee that
there will be a maximum of of Oppression
and suffering and also brutality in
Indochina so we've refused reparations
which we certainly owe them we've
refused Aid we've blocked trade we've
blocked aid from International
organizations uh we've tried to prevent
other countries from aiding them for
example just I mean the the level of
sism that was achieved and this is kind
of hard to imagine sometimes uh one of
the things that the United States did in
the war against Vietnam was to destroy
most of the Buffalo well that's a
peasant you know a peasant Society
Buffalo means track actors fertilizers
and so on uh and uh uh in fact like the
Washington Post publishes pictures of
peasants pulling plows uh and this is
supposed to be proof of communist
iniquity you know actually those
pictures were in fact Fabrications of
tha intelligence very likely but they
could have gotten real pictures if they
wanted uh and the reason why peasants
are pulling plows is because we killed
the Buffalo Well India tried to send 100
Buffalo which is nothing you know and
the United States tried to block it by
blocking food for peace Aid Believe It
or Not uh menites tried to send pencils
to Cambodia Government tried to block it
Oxfam tried to send solar pumps to
Cambodia they tried to block it you know
shovels to LA to dig up unexploded
ordinance nothing is allowed you know
that country has to suffer maximally so
that we can then use that suffering to
justify the attack and to justify
similar attacks against other countries
that's the postwar I mean the uh
President Carter in one of his sermons
about human rights literally said the
following he said that we owe Vietnam no
debt he said because the destruction was
Mutual now you know that's a statement
that's that's a statement that that
bears comparison to to Stalin or Hitler
actually but it passed without a mention
there wasn't a comment on it in the
American Press yep the destruction was
Mutual just of walk around the streets
of Washington and Boston and you can see
it's just like you know it's like Vin so
uh and you know and but the fact again
that this this statement could be made
this monstrous statement could be made
without comment again that tells you
something about the manufacturer of
consent the level of indoctrination well
in fact all of this was a Triumph of the
manufacturer of consent again among the
educated part of the population less so
elsewhere where the Vietnam syndrome
remains well let me briefly turn to
Central America and draw a few parallels
I won't go through the whole history
because it's too long and horrifying the
United States has in fact been
tormenting Central America for well for
over 130 years now actually back to 1800
if you pursue it in all of its gury
detail in
1854 the first major military uh attack
took place this was against Nicaragua uh
in 1854 the American Navy burned down a
towns Port Town San Juan delnorte uh in
Nicaragua the re this was not a
capricious act I should say it was an
act of Revenge uh what had happened is
that an American millionaire Cornelius
Vanderbilt had sailed his yacht into the
town and the port officials had tried to
Levy charges against it so in
retaliation the Navy burned the town
down uh that town was uh captured about
a year ago briefly for a couple days by
contess and the Press made a big fuss
about it but they kind of omitted the
history which is interesting that was
1854 uh through this Century America the
United States for long periods inv
invaded and occupied Haiti the Dominican
Republic
Nicaragua um Panama Honduras country
after country virtually every country
that we invaded and occupied
we left after you know ravaging it and
so on in Haiti reinstating slavery and
torturing and so on we left murderous
military dictators Who Remain tro uh
Samoa the DU and so on that's the
characteristic result uh without going
into details the whole region has been
turned into a kind of a horror chamber
one of the worst in the world with slave
slavery of mass starvation while crops
are turned while crop lands are turned
to export
uh torture murder I mean any horror you
can think of uh that's an an interesting
reflection of American History if this
in a really free Society this kind of
stuff would be taught in elementary
school but here it's suppressed uh and
the extent to which it suppressed is
again remarkable you can take a look
this morning at the New York Times where
there's an oped by uh the editor of
foreign policy the more liberal of the
general foreign policy journals in which
he describes how awful Central America
is and he gives all the reasons I mean
the Spanish you know colonization the
culture and so on and so forth one
reason happens to be missing you know
guess which one uh that's a level of
cowardice and dishonesty which again is
very hard to duplicate uh elsewhere but
is absolutely characteristic here well
that's Central americ General let's take
a look at El Salvador in particular uh
in El Salvador in
1932 there was a mass murder uh maybe 20
or 30,000 peasants were killed and the
country was traumatized and disciplined
uh the dictator who carried it out ran
an election for the benefit of the
United States in which he was the only
candidate and we duly recognized him uh
it everything was fine you know just
normal torture and starvation and so on
until about 1960 when there was a
reformist officers coup which looked
like it might change the situation uh
the Kennedy administration blocked it
supported a counter coup restore the
dictatorship uh the again things were
quiet through the 60s uh in 1972 there
was an election uh the people who were
elected were dwarte and guo Uno now head
of the um the political organization
associated with the guerillas uh that
however the election was immediately
overthrown by a military coup backed by
the United States involving the
participation of the two two of the most
loyal and murderous us allies Guatemala
and Nicaragua dwarte uh came to Wasing
waston at that time uh nobody was
interested uh the only Senators who
people a congressman who would even talk
to him were Kennedy and Tom Harkin rest
didn't care the Press didn't care and so
on that's expresses our interest in
elections uh the same thing happened in
1977 again no interest uh in fact
everything was fine know it was under a
military dictator just the normal story
however there were two developments that
were worrisome the first was what was
happening in Nicaragua in 19 1979 samoza
who was the most loyal American Ally uh
was overthrown and it was be the Carter
Administration was beginning to be
concerned that the same thing might
happen in El Salvador in the United
States might also lose control there the
second thing that was happening was even
more threatening there was a growth
through n the 1970s of what they called
their popular organizations now these
typically started from things like say
Bible study groups run by the church
which turned into self-help
organizations which sometimes became
peasant cooperatives or peas
associations and unions and so on and so
forth in fact there was the beginning of
the development of of uh popular
organizations in which people could
actually participate uh and that's
intolerable for a very simple reason
That's the basis for democracy you can't
have democracy in any meaningful sense
if isolated individuals have to face
concentrated power alone uh if that's
what if that's the system you've got
then democracy amounts to pushing a
lever once every couple of years to
select choose between
representatives of one or another group
that has a base in the private elsewhere
usually the private economy real
democracy means participation it means
people it means isolated individuals
with limited resources can pool those
resources can have ideas you know can
exchange information can have access to
information can can put forth programs
and can figure out ways to implement
those programs on the political agenda
unless you've got that you don't have
any democracy now there's one group of
course that has that well whatever
groups there are that that own the
private economy typically have that
ability but nobody else does uh and
that's a prerequisite to democracy and
that was beginning to develop in El
Salvador in the 70s which is very
frightening uh as you can see from the
geopolitical considerations that I
mentioned uh well what did the United
States do in 1979 The Carter
Administration October 79 backed the
reformist coup a military coup which
overthrew the dictatorship The Carter
Administration who they were afraid of
was going to all the Carter
Administration however insisted that the
most reactionary and brutal military
elements be dominant in the Hun killings
rapidly increased by early 1980 a few
months later the group had collapsed the
left Christian democrats the Socialists
the reformist Military Officers were out
and power was back in the hands of the
usual Thugs who we support in Latin
America at that point uh Jose Napoleon
Duarte came in to provide a cover for
what he knew what was going to happen we
knew was going to happen next namely a
huge Massacre to try to crush the
popular organizations and he's been
playing that role ever since much to the
Applause of the American audience which
regards this as a a great proof of you
know that he should win the Nobel Peace
Prize or something like that uh that was
early 1980 in February in right at that
time the Archbishop Archbishop Romero uh
wrote a letter to Carter a important
letter in which he pleaded with Carter
not to send military aid the reason he
said was that military aid would be used
to increase the repression and to
destroy the popular organizations which
he said are fighting for the fundamental
human rights but of course that was the
very essence of American policy so
Carter naturally sent the aid uh he sent
it again with an astonishing orwellian
phrase uh namely he said he went to the
Congress he said we have to send the
military aid so that the military can
play a more significant role in uh
reforms he knew exactly what the reforms
were going to be they were exactly what
the Archbishop said namely destruction
of the uh increasing the repression and
destruction of the uh popular
organizations well that's what happened
exactly as predictable and predicted a
couple of weeks later the Archbishop was
assassinated uh in May 1980 Carter's war
against the peasantry began with major
massacres usually in areas designated
for land reform which provided a kind of
cover for the massacres in June the
University was attacked and destroyed
many people killed the building
buildings pillaged and destroyed uh in
November the political opposition was
massacred meanwhile the independent
press was wiped out we don't believe in
censorship in the United States what we
believe in is what we did in El Salvador
namely you blow up the newspaper you
take the editor out and you hack into
pieces with the machete and so on and so
forth and pretty soon there's no need
for censorship so by the there isn't any
censorship in El Salvador uh that's uh
that was the Carter War about 10,000
people killed during during that one
mostly suppressed in the Press here I
should say uh dwares himself said that
the masses were with the guerillas at
that time but he felt better afterwards
he said now they're not anymore which is
probably true after you're subjected to
an experience like that uh Carter's war
against the popular organizations was a
success uh they were destroyed but again
it had the usual consequence people
began to flock to the gorillas which
proves that the Russians are coming that
period is very similar to what happened
in Vietnam in the 19 in the late 1950
very similar check it out you find very
much the same was happening well at that
point Reagan came in uh you what he
would have expected to do is exactly
what Kennedy did namely escalate the war
by American bombing he didn't he tried
but he didn't the reason he didn't was
because the country this country has
changed a lot in the past 20 years when
Kennedy attacked South Vietnam there was
virtually no protest in fact as I
mentioned that event doesn't exist in
American history which is an indication
of the of the uh
depth of indoctrination of the period
but that's not true anymore when Reagan
began to move towards direct aggression
against El Salvador there was a very
substantial popular response and the
government had to back off they've had
to use more devious methods to T out
Mass Slaughter in El Salvador which have
been very brutal and destructive but
it's still short of B52 bombing and so
on and so forth well Reagan picked it up
where Carter left off by the end of 19
by the end of 1981 according to church
sources in El Salvador about 30,000
people had been killed and about 600,000
refugees have been created uh and as the
church announced that Jean Kirkpatrick
made a speech in which he extolled the
moral quality of the government that was
doing it uh those figures have
incidentally been approximately doubled
since uh well that's El Salvador it's
still going on there's no commentary on
it there's no debate over it uh it's
considered among reasonable people among
reasonable Humane people it's considered
simply our right to carry out mass
murder in El Salvador so there's nothing
to debate nothing in Congress about it
nothing in the Press very little
reported if you want to learn about it
you've got to go to the reports of Human
Rights organizations which document in
detail the indiscriminate murder carried
out by the Air Force with direct you
know with American control and
coordination uh the torture in the
prisons and so on and so forth but in
the press nothing it's just a marvelous
tribute to Our Success that this is
happening uh there is some protest about
Nicaragua and that again tells you
something about the nature of the
propaganda system and the way the
government sets the terms of debate
inally here to here the peace movement
has fallen into the Trap totally uh let
me illustrates very similar to what
happened in the mid-60s in the mid-60s
uh there was considerable protest about
the war against North Vietnam the
bombing of North Vietnam but very little
protest about the bombing of South
Vietnam which was far more intense
and far more destructive uh and the
ground war against South Vietnam even
more so the protest was against the war
against the North and the reason was
that that carried potential costs for us
uh the war against the South has no
costs we just murdered defenseless
people you know been supp the thing uh
in fact that's kind of a historical
vocation you might say uh in uh the war
against the north however is problematic
uh it could bring in the Chinese you
know could bring in the Russian has
International complications it's another
country you know so therefore there was
protest about it the Pentagon
incidentally noticed this mcnam for
example points out in secret documents
that the protest is against the bombing
of the north not against the more
intensive bombing of the South and Drew
the appropriate conclusions notice how
the story is being replayed today the
pro the the attack against Nicaragua is
bad enough in fact very bad but it's
nothing like the attack against El
Salvador I mean not remotely like it uh
but the protest is against the attack on
Nicaragua the government has framed the
debate so that you're allowed to discuss
whether the United States is allow is um
should or should not attack Nicaragua uh
but you're not allowed to discuss
whether we have the right to attack El
Salvador that's just a given that's out
of discussion the peace movement has
fallen into the Trap totally uh the
pledge of resistance for example uh is a
pledge of resistance if the government
escalates the war against Nicaragua
there is no pledge of resistance if the
government continues the war against
Salvador again that's a given uh lots of
people were arrested me included last
week about the Embargo against Nicaragua
but nobody was arrested and there was no
demonstration about the Mass Slaughter
being conducted in El Salvador that's a
given again again this illustrates uh
the enormous power of the state to set
the terms of discussion to frame the
discussion in terms acceptable to it the
debate over Nicaragua is more or less
acceptable because that could just as
the war as the debate over North Vietnam
was acceptable because kind of lying
behind that is the idea that somehow you
can it can be construed in defensive
terms it can be construed as defense of
El Salvador against somebody and then
you can argue about whether there's
really an attack or not but the attack
against South Vietnam or the attack
against El Salvador that can't be
construed in any terms other than Mass
Slaughter uh and in fact if you look at
its reasons they're obvious to prevent
exactly the reasons that the Archbishop
gave namely to destroy the popular
organizations that are fighting for the
people's fundamental human rights
there's no way to make that tolerable to
the propaganda system so therefore you
got to suppress it and we all play along
should say myself included uh the the
peace movement included we all play
along because we're so effectively
brainwash well all of that uh
illustrates once again the triumphs of
the manufacturer of consent in a society
with a
sophisticated uh and class conscious
ruling class that learns that thinks
that has resources uh that plans uh and
that in fact controls the means of
indoctrination uh as long as the
educated classes accept the appropriate
degree of cility the same story could be
repeated with regard to the Middle East
with regard to the so-called arms race
and all sorts of other things and also
domestic issues no time for that well
when a superpower uh gains the ability
to when it develops an effective system
of indoctrination then the World becomes
a very dangerous place uh we here should
be able to come to understand these
crucial features of our society and also
to act to change them the fate of many
millions of people throughout the world
and very likely the fate of human
civilization depends quite directly I
think on our willingness to undertake
that task and to carry it forth with
honesty and courage and determination
than
what I said was I I I thank uh Professor
Chomsky for mentioning the fact that the
peace movement has not picked up very
much on the slaughter of citizens in El
Salvador however part of the peace
movement has that part is an
organization known as cispus uh which is
a solidarity Organization for El
Salvador and cisus has in fact been
running a campaign uh since early this
spring uh posing the bombing in El
Salvador one of the problems is of
course that um it's a small organization
in the United States and the Congress
hasn't uh followed along but I will say
that I have brochures outside at the
casa table where you can send money and
you can do whatever is possible and I'm
sure gome can tell you some of the
things that we as American citizens can
do but I have brochures describing the
bombing campaign in El Salvador and
suggest in means for overcoming the
bombing campaign in El Salvador and if
everybody would come to the next Casa
meeting which is the first
Wednesday uh in the month of June right
here 7 o'clock at the downstairs
conference room we meet every wedes
every first Wednesday and third Monday
of the month at
7:00 we'll give you things to do and I
think as n has pointed out that's our
only hope in this struggle
I certainly endorse that this the really
Scandal the way we've let that go by let
me just make one comment about that
dwarte who's the official hero around
here recently announced that he's not
going to accept any more human rights
charges from the church human right
rights office uh to T gal because he
said it's allied with people who are
controlled by the subversives that is
the church is all Communists that's the
guy who's the big Democrat and he also
said at that time that the Air Force is
not engaged in any indiscriminate
attacks against civilians it's only
engaged in uh air attacks supporting
ground forces the oppos the contrary of
that is described in very graphic and
gory detail uh in a series of America's
watch reports uh in the last couple of
months this one last month one last
August and one last April that's the man
who uh everyone is lating you know as
the next Nobel Peace Prize U uh
aure yeah how do you know what's in the
SEC secret oh because again this is a
very open Society more so than any other
in the world and secret documents do get
released so the documents that I was
quoting in fact have all been released
they were top secret documents I'm sorry
uh there's also a very valuable store of
documents which were uh released thank
liberated we might say thanks to Dan
ellsburg namely the Pentagon papers and
that's particularly valuable because
usually you don't get access to a
government secret documents unless the
government decides to release them that
was a case where the government didn't
decide to release them and in fact uh
they're very interesting however I
should say that they're not all that
different from the public documents that
have been released uh we have act this
you know I I don't know what would
happen if Scholars and journalists ever
started using the documentary record
maybe at that point they'd stop
releasing it but the fact of the matter
is they do release it it sort of doesn't
matter too much because nobody ever sees
it except some you know fanatics but uh
it's there if you want to look and in
fact it's there there's you know there
books and articles discussing it
too how did it happen that the New York
Times given theil
well you have to remember when it was
that was
1972 And there's some important things
to bear in mind here uh by 19 in in
January 1968 the Ted offensive took
place now the Ted offensive changed the
calculation of costs of American
Elites they decided there was a question
how to react to the Ted Ted offenseive
was an astonishing event I mean
throughout South Vietnam and just about
every city there was a coordinated we
even the term is very misleading I mean
it it's you know the term again reflects
the indoctrination system it's it's a
logical impossibility for the South
Vietnamese to carry out an offensive in
South Vietnam it wasn't an offensive it
was a it was an uprising against the
aggressors that's what we ought to call
it but the Tet Uprising uh took place in
a coordinated fashion in just about
every city in South Vietnam the
Americans had we had over half million
troops there there were very few North
Vietnamese there in fact only about
50,000 North Vietnamese mostly at the
border they were probably outnumbered at
the time by the Thai and Korean
mercenaries that we had there and the
United States just dwarfed anyone nobody
got had an inkling of it you know
there's this hu this coordinated Mass
Uprising in city after city which the
United States which just was controlling
the whole society had no inkling of
that's an indication of the extent of
the popular involvement in it uh they
the the they now like to say that the
result was a victory for the United
States and in a certain sense that's
true the United States had such enormous
F fire power that it was able to wipe
out huge numbers of South Vietnamese uh
so in that sense of course it was a
victory but it frightened people in
Washington it made them recognize that
it was going to be a long drawn out War
well the question arose as to whether to
send more troops and the deliberations
are interesting and instructive The
Joint Chiefs were opposed to sending
more troops and one of their reasons was
that they thought those troops would be
needed here for civil disorder
control uh that tells you something uh
the uh and they spelled it out they they
mentioned groups that were going to be a
problem youth women others no literally
know uh and they literally felt that
they had to keep the troops here you
know also the United the government was
worried about that time about at the
time of the fact that the Army was
collapsing the American Army much to its
credit I should say
disintegrated uh and uh that's not a
small fact the United States again is
unique another element of American
uniqueness is that other Imperial Powers
have not used citizens armies for
colonial wars That's Unique it it was a
bad mistake uh for a colonial war you
need professional Killers you need
people like the French Foreign Legion
you know ex-nazis that's what the U
French used they didn't send the
conscript Army to Vietnam the British
didn't use conscript armies they used
professional Killers often Hill
tribesmen or people who were trained to
be professional murderers you'll notice
in South Africa they do the same thing a
lot of the killing is done by
professional killers taken from the
oppressed communities themselves it's
very typical incidentally a typical
Colonial practice the United States made
a mistake it sent a citizen's Army and
uh you can't get Ordinary People off the
streets uh to become professional
murderers and that's what a colonial war
is it means going into a village and you
know killing women and children and old
men and that sort of business uh so uh
that didn't work and the Army began to
collapse and that was a problem well uh
also another thing and here again see
the a calc a decis decision was made in
early
1968 uh and it's on record to cut back
the
War uh that's when Johnson decided not
to run and all sorts of things changed
uh it was just getting too costly they
couldn't win the war at an appre at at a
at a at a a proper cost well then Nixon
came in and tried to continue the war
and a lot of the business Community was
against him very strongly against him
they felt it was harming the American
position in international trade it was
weakening the dollar it was causing
stagflation it was causing domestic
uproar which they didn't want they want
a nice quiet population uh and for all
these reasons they really wanted to stop
it there was a real split within the
ruling class if you want and it's in
that context that the New York Times
published The Pentagon Papers uh it's
also in that context that Watergate took
place uh Watergate which was in my view
largely a farce was uh uh partly a
reaction to What strong elements of the
ruling class regarded as ni's crimes
against them and one of them was just
dragging this war on too far when they
figured they had achieved what they
wanted you know Vietnam was not going to
recover now let's get out and turn to
something more important uh however I
should say that the release of the
Pentagon papers and I think I don't know
how smart the New York Times editors are
but the fact is that the release of the
Pentagon papers had almost no effect
because they've been suppressed they've
been suppressed as effectively as if
they had never been released uh if you
look at the take a look at the books
that are coming out say Carno you know
or certainly the retrospectives but even
the scholarly books and you'll notice
that the material in there is not
used see in fact uh the material in
there said just tells the wrong story
for example the material on the planning
is very extensive in the Pentagon papers
and that's never used if people refer to
the Pentagon papers at all which they
rarely do even in scholarly work it's
usually stuff about the s64 or 1965 when
there were when there were mainly
tactical questions I mean all the major
decisions already been made you know
there only a question of how to
implement things and then you can
discuss it did we use the right tactics
you know should we done it this way that
way but the major stuff from the late
40s and through the 50s that's virtually
never discussed uh and there's a lot of
important material in the Pentagon
papers I could mention some things but
it's all been suppressed so it's just as
well it's just as if it didn't get
released just to give you an indication
of this there's the U the the beacon
press published the four volumes of the
Pentagon papers and they published a
fifth volume which is an index and the
index includes a collection of essays on
the Pentagon papers by Gabriel calco and
John daer and lots of lots of good
essays I think they're good I edited the
volume but uh the it's it that volume is
practically
unsold few thousand copies were sold of
that volume and that tells you something
and of course a lot of the sales are the
people who wanted the essays now anybody
who's going to use the Pentagon paper
needs that volume you can can't use a
four volume work without an index okay
so the fact that nobody was buying the
volume including even University
libraries means that they didn't intend
that anybody would ever look at them
okay and in fact that's what's
happened uh what's your understanding of
your
asss that people to
vot against their own interest not
against independent of yeah
right I understand yeah
you feel disenfranchised you just vot
someone that makes you feel why does it
make them yeah okay so the question is
why do people vote against their own
interests and just in favor of somebody
who makes them feel good if they feel
disenfranchised well uh I think that
reflects a certain degree of
sophistication actually uh if you
recognize that the election is a PR game
and it's for show and it's sort of fun
like a circus so you might as well be
part of it uh and there's a lot of Pola
and you know it's exciting and so on
then who should you vote for well you
know the guy who has a nice smile let's
say or the guy who makes you feel good
when you sort of uh you know watch them
on television or something why not you
know I think that's probably the way
most people think that's why you that's
why you get see every everyone talks
about the Reagan Landslide well just
take a close look at the Reagan
Landslide uh 53% of the PO of the
electorate voted way below any other
country of that 59% voted for Reagan
which if you do the arithmetic means he
got a I forget what like 32% of the vote
of that roughly 32% of the vote about
2/3 I think it was 60% to be precise
said that they hoped that his his
proposals would not be enacted okay uh
of the when the detailed polling was
done of exits from polls when they
checked people's attitudes it turned out
that about I think I forget I think the
figure was about 4% of the people who
voted for Reagan said they strongly
approved of his programs what that means
is that the landslide consisted of
something maybe 2% of the electorate
okay that's the landslide everybody's
talking about now why did people do it
well you know well I think the failure
to vote I I I think we learned something
from the fact that the failure to vote
was socioeconomically localized as it
always is people you know the people who
don't vote didn't see anything in it for
them uh of the people who did vote uh a
lot voted I mean some voted because you
know I mean like I have friends in fact
one one friend of mine who was an ex
malist I should say explained to me that
he voted for Reagan because Reagan's
been good to him which is true people in
our income group Reagan's been very good
to all you do have to do is look at the
redistribution of real disposable income
during the Reagan years and uh it's a
sort of a straight line if you if you
break the population up into segments
depending on income you know low to high
and you ask what's happened to real
disposable income is going like that you
know it's fallen for the lowest risen
for the highest and essentially straight
all the way across so there are people
who know that they can see you know the
rich can see that stealing from the poor
is good to the rich you know so they
vote for Reagan uh but for much of the
population it's just a matter of of kind
of recognizing the public relations gain
you could actually see that you see the
American political commentary is very
interesting so you Rec I mean you know
you remember the last election uh the uh
let like take the debates okay what
happened in the
debates you remember the commentary on
the debates the commentary was about
like whether Mandel wore the right tie
you know or whether Geraldine Ferraro
looked down instead of at the camera you
know or whether you know Reagan could
sort of get by in a half an hour without
making some totally idiotic Gap I mean
that was the uh that was the level of
the commentary the the nobody talk about
any issues because they really couldn't
find any issues you know and in fact
issues are regarded to be irrelevant the
the level of cynicism in the FED in the
National campaigns is really quite
remarkable so for example during the at
the Kennedy administration here here's a
case in point uh during the Kennedy
administration in the 1960 campaign
Kennedy hired a firm uh run by couple of
MIT political scientists which is how I
know about it called Simon Maddox uh one
of them uh was in fact a student of the
guy Harold lasswell who I mentioned
before and what this company was going
to do was the following just think of
this and the cynicism is mindblowing
this company uh which had a lot of
computers and all that kind of business
had broken the population up into a lots
and lots of categories you know like
Polish women from 38 to 42 and things
like that all sorts of categories and
what and they claimed to have a method
whereby they could tell for any
statement that you made how people in
those categories were going to react to
it you know like whether they would like
it this much or that much and so on and
then using you know some statistical
means and computer and stuff you could
determine the impact across these
various voting groups of any particular
statement you made and the point of
selling this to the Kennedy campaign was
that then they could adjust they could
decide what to say uh on the basis of
how you would it would sort of average
out over these various voting groups
that they were trying to appeal to well
what that mean I mean that means that a
complete understanding that what you say
is totally irrelevant to what you're
going to do you know well I think a lot
of the population understands that too
and if so you might just as well vote
for whoever makes you feel good or not
vote at
all andly Europe is well behind us on
this but they're catching up they'll
have packaged elections too pretty soon
by the time they learn the pr tricks
that and the voter management tricks
that we've
developed you you were talking about the
level of commentary about the
presidential debates I thought I thought
there was one interesting outcome of
that he one of the sort of Mainline
American uh Network com commentors refer
to George Bush speaking with geralo
being George Bush is being frill I see
usually went the other
way okay yeah all right that's the same
sort of thing I mean it's you know style
is the only thing that counts because
they all understand at some level that
the substance is
elsewhere and in fact you know probably
if you sort of look at the last election
it was really a debate over there was a
there were policy decisions like should
we continue to pour money into military
expenditures as a way of revitalizing
the economy or should we worry about the
debt and so on that's those are the real
issues but that's not what people
debated couple of years ago you were
describing the very Vol situation the
Middle East russan Manning s missiles
Syria I believe if I heard correctly
years ago at it as a very Danger
esal
Poss in the Middle
East yeah could you
hear well the comment was that I had
said a couple of years ago that probably
around 82 that would have been I guess
that uh the uh Russian Manning of uh Sam
missiles in Syria and Lebanon uh ra
raised the power the likelihood of
superpower confrontation in fact one of
the consequences the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon Israel used High sophisticated
American Technology to destroy a sort of
second level uh Soviet air defense
system as part of that was part of the
attack against Syria uh during the
during that war and the Russians
responded as you'd Imagine by moving in
a high level U sophisticated air defense
system and sending American estimates
were about 7,000 Soviet troops to to to
demand them that number's probably
reduced it a little bit since and I me I
said at the time that that brought the
world very close to a superpower
confrontation as indeed it did well
since that time you know the thing has
sort of oscillated up and back it was
it's been worse in some periods Less in
others During the period when the United
States was bombing when they say the New
Jersey Battleship New Jersey was bombing
the hills above Beirut it was very
dangerous they were probably killing
Russians uh the Russians didn't respond
that time but it could have blown up uh
at the at this particular moment it
happen the tensions happen to have been
relaxed a little and the reason is that
the United States has essentially sort
of authorized Syria to try to settle the
Lebanon Problem by itself however it's
just on the border you know I mean
sooner or later Israel is going to have
to attack
Syria uh and they know it they're
discussing it uh and there are very good
reasons for it uh in a in the situation
of military the The crucial issue in the
Middle East is whether there's going to
be a political settlement now the United
States is the main factor in blocking
the political settlement that's another
thing that's never discussed here uh the
United States has been the major element
blocking any political settlement there
and of course Israel too because it
doesn't want a political settlement but
they can do it as long as we back it uh
and as long as there's no political
settlement and there is a military
confrontation Israel cannot allow any
Arab state or any combination of Arab
states to begin to approach it in
military strength I mean that's just on
you know perfect reasonable grounds
because if if there is a confrontation
it could lose and it could get wiped out
so therefore they're going to have to
attack Syria pretty soon uh and they're
talking about it uh and they're trying
to figure out you know conditions and so
on and that could very well lead again
to a superpower
confrontation uh that area is the area
that's really likely to start the next
World War this incidentally is not just
my opinion it's the opinion of virtually
every analyst so for example there was a
there was a secret Air Force document
leaked in this case whoever asked about
these things leaked the Press but as far
as I know not published in the American
press it was published in the Canadian
press uh called Air Force 2000 which was
a planning you know sort of estimating
the likelihood of War up to the year
2000 and they said like everybody that
the chance of a war breaking out in
Europe is very slight the chance of a
war breaking out in the third world is
very high superpower war and they said
the Middle East is the main area the
Middle East they said is they said what
they said is this as long as the Arab
Israeli conflict is not settled by
political settlement uh the chances for
Global Peace are remote and the chance
of a nuclear war by the year 2000 are
quite High uh for people who are
involved in the disarmament movement I
should say this ought to be their
primary concern if they're reasonable
it's a lot more I mean it's bad enough
to have Star Wars and MX and all that
sort of business but this is much more
dangerous
yeah for blocking a political settlement
well what's the American objective in
blocking a political settlement well
this is a complicated business it goes
back to what the whole American
geopolitical planning has strategic
planning has been for the Middle East
and the the the concept that has been
developed over the years is that as
everywhere in the world we have we have
the same enemy in the Middle East we
have everywhere else namely the IND ous
population uh what's called over there
radical Arab nationalism where radical
is a technical term radical nationalism
means the nationalism of anybody who
doesn't follow orders it's opposed to
what's called moderate nationalism which
is the nationalism of those who do
follow orders again this has nothing to
do with political position or anything
else by the late 1950s uh again on the
basis of secret documents released uh we
know that the United States had decided
had recognized that to oppose radical
Arab nationalism it would probably be
necessary to support Israel as a
military
force that position got strengthened
through the 60s uh uh especially with
Israel's military victory in ' 67 uh and
uh Israel began to be understood as
what's now called a strategic asset uh
in the context of the Nixon Doctrine
around 1970 this was further reaffirmed
the Nixon Doctrine you remember was a
recognition that the United States could
not police the World by itself
we didn't have the power anymore
relatively to do policing action
everywhere we needed surrogate States uh
and in the Middle East the surrogate
states were supposed to be Israel and
Iran under the Sha and American Aid to
Israel shot up at that point uh By 1979
the Sha had fallen and Israel was left
as the last surrogate State uh American
policy has been to try to turn Israel
into a militarized state highly
militarized state with lacking an
independent economy uh so that it's
complet completely dependent on the
United States for survival a it's
important for it to be a pariah state so
therefore it can't get support from
anyone else and a kind of a pressure
that we like an attack dog you know that
we can use when we need it to guarantee
rather narrowly conceived American
interests in the Middle East and also to
use elsewhere it's very convenient for a
superpower that's trying to Run the
World by force it's very convenient for
it to have a militarily advanced
technologically advanced uh State
dedicated to war with a trained
population and nowhere else to look you
know no other means of survival other
than dependence on us you can use it all
over the place we've used it in Africa
and Asia but primarily in Latin America
so for example the massacres in
Guatemala in the early part of the
Reagan Administration which were
enormous you know thousands if not tens
of thousands of people were massacred
the Reagan Administration was blocked
from conducting limit directly by
Congressional human rights legislation
so it was able to use use Israel to do
it and that's valuable for a superpower
uh in the people who support this
position are called supporters of Israel
that's another nice orwellian phrase
they're actually supporters of Israel's
destruction you know because that's what
it's leading to uh but uh that's another
story uh that's I think that's the sort
of encapsulated the thinking behind it
and of course that's inconsistent with
the political settlement a political
settlement would just mean that Israel
would be you know something like the
Switzerland of the Middle East but
that's no use we want it to be the
pressure of the Middle East and that
requires a military conflict so we've
blocked any political Settlements a
political settlement would mean that
Israel would have to withdraw to
something like the 67 borders and then
it would be you could have a police
peace peaceful settlement in those terms
but not with a really powerful military
State there that can be that's in a
state of conflict and therefore you
know requires military support and is
available for military uses
pardon I'm sorry I can't see very well
there yeah could you
yeah well for one thing I'm not sure
they're all that aware uh but basically
they kind of agree with it you know the
the Soviet Union since in in the second
world during the second world were the
Soviet Union we don't have their
documents but we can see pretty well
what they were up to the Soviet Union
has been in favor of U uh what is called
dayon dayon is a sharing in World
Management on the part of the two
superpowers where each one I where they
are of course the junior partner because
they're weaker but where each allows the
other to run its own do its own domain
without too much interference so we
allow them to run their domain and they
allow us to run our domain most most it
and that's essentially what they've been
pressing since the late' 40s without too
much change incidentally a little
picking away at the periphery but uh
essentially that's Soviet
policy we occasionally agree to that
like during the years of dayon in the
early 70s we for a period agreed to that
but then for various reasons mainly
having to do I think with the domestic
economy and the need for intervention uh
we pulled away from it
it's not very pretty but it's you know
you can
understand um you've been talking
tonight about how the immorality of our
policy and how the different struct
support that press and
education
and through all the study everything
you've been doing do you think it's
possible to reform those policies um
change the B effect having bring them
back and
to the people's needs through working
through the structures that exist
through the Press through the
educational economic systems what do you
think it's necessary to create new
structures either or
not well I think it's very hard to give
an answer to that I think we ought what
obviously what you try to do is change
the policies as much as you can through
existing structures and it's hard to
predict the extent to which they'll be
resistant to that but I think they will
be resistant to it uh but quite
independently of that I think we ought
to change the internal institutions of
our own Society anyway because they're
oppressive and uh uh in many ways
intolerable and inhuman so even if it
turns out contrary to what I believe
that you could make a serious change in
foreign policy with our present
institutions we ought to be trying to
change them
anyhow again Sera well it depends what
you're talking about for example one
that we ought to overcome I think I mean
to me it's I was talking about this this
afternoon if you were here but uh I
don't see an enormous difference between
a a society in which you have to sell in
which you sell yourself to someone and a
society in which you rent yourself to
someone I mean they seem to be
approximately equally inhuman well we
agree now that we didn't 100 years ago
on the first that slavery is wrong but
there's another thing which in the old
days used to be called wage slavery
which means that you rent yourself to
somebody else in order to survive it
means that control over resources and
production and investment is in the
hands of a a separate a particular and
rather small group of people and
everyone else has the choice of either
dying or rent renting themselves to them
more or less on their terms uh and I
that seems to me a totally intolerable
form of human life you know I mean
there's no reason to accept that anymore
than there was a reason to accept
slavery or feudalism or whatever uh and
uh
that now you know you how do you change
that well you try to change it through
existing institutions you probably fail
in which case you change the
institutions which are not Graven and
stone you know history hasn't come to an
end
yeah could you hear what What
alternative sources are there
informations or yeah uh well first let
me say that I think when you read
anything including you know what I write
uh specifically you got to remember that
everybody's got an ax to grind you know
and history isn't physics you know I
mean in physics the world pretty much
controls what you do and makes you
honest you can't lie in physics you'll
be caught very quickly uh but history
isn't like that you know you can lie for
a long time and nobody will ever catch
you uh and uh the reason is that you
know the the intellectual structure of
the field is not such that you got the
real constraints of the outside world so
you pick and choose you know you pick
and choose from a massive stuff and you
pick what you think is important and
there's a lot of subjective judgment and
there's a lot of ideology and that
should be understood what that means is
that anything that you read uh I I try
to be as upfront as I can be about where
I stand there's also something called
objectivity which is a total fraud and
what that means is uh accepting the
ideology of the established system
that's called objectivity uh but you
should recognize where somebody's coming
from and what they think is important
and what their values are and what
they're looking for and so on and so
forth and then you got to compensate for
and there you just have to rely on your
own intelligence and understanding
there's no answer answer and that's no
matter what you read uh that having been
said uh there are two points that ought
to be made one point is that the
mainstream uh indoctrination system
happens to contain a lot of
information it does for two reasons for
one thing because there are people who
have to know the facts like business
business has to know the facts they got
a lot at stake you know and so when you
read The Wall Street Journal news news
reports not the commentary when you read
the news reports they're probably pretty
accurate uh and the same is often true
in the New York Times news reports now
you've got to know how to read them you
know so you have to read defense of
South Vietnam as attack against South
Vietnam you know and things like that uh
but once you understand how to read them
you know then you can get a lot of
information out of them uh and of course
you've got to read carefully like you
have to compare today's lies against
yesterday's lies you know some or for
example you read government denials when
you read government denials you're often
learning what in fact happened quite
typically they will not refer to an
event but they'll refer to the
government denial of it and then you
check back and you know you find it
happened and so on so there's all sorts
of techniques for for you know
penetrating the uh the major media on
top of that there Al you're of course
better off if you read widely so if you
have if you can say read you know for
example the Manchester Guardian even the
weekly Edition uh you will learn things
about say Central America that you won't
read in the American Press uh like the
British press it's not because Britain
is such a wonderful country it's just
that they don't happen to be the guys
who are committing the crimes in Central
America so therefore they can write
about them more openly uh and uh uh if
you read journals like say the nation
especially people like Alex cob uh
you'll learn an awful lot that'll never
be in the American press or even if it's
there everybody's not understand it you
know uh but he does and uh or you know
in these times and such journals we'll
have things that either won't like for
example uh Terror in Al Salvador has
been described and in these times and in
the guardian uh but not in the
mainstream press that's always been true
at the time of the tonen gulf incident
for instance when the whole which was a
real turning point in the war total
fraud government claimed that American
ships had been attacked and that was the
start of the big attack in Vietnam the
press the mainstream press brought
bought it
100% but the guardian didn't and told
the truth in fact and that turned out to
be the truth I mean the americ the New
York
Guardian uh of course uh you always have
you know you always read those things
with skepticism like anything but
nevertheless U there are times when
they'll report things that the
mainstream press won't report or they'll
understand things that the mainstream
press won't
understand but ultimately I don't think
there's any substitute for just the
diligence and intelligence and
skepticism a lot of
skepticism now see that's one of the
ways in which people are kept ignorant
you can have all the information there
but only a very small number of people
are in a position to put forth the
effort to try to figure out what's going
on you have to be very privileged you
know quite privileged before you can
even do this you have to have resources
you have to have training you know you
have to have time time you know you have
to have all sorts of things that most
people don't have in order even to be
able to figure out what's going on
that's one reason why the country is
sort of safe in having a lot of
information
available only very few people are going
to be able to get at it and you know
that's why you need
organization I mean if you can group
together in organizations you can do
what individuals can't
do that's crucial that's one reason why
the United States has always attempted
to block things like political parties
or meaningful organizations in which
people can participate because that's
the way in which isolated individuals
can overcome the lack of
resources the only
way so go to the next c
meeting Bas on the that is against sorry
I can't hear based on our on the theory
that it is against the
us against the US interest to have
settlement in the Middle East do you
really think those moves now that we are
seeing by Egypt Israel and jph are
orchestrated since they
are well do I think that the moves by
Israel Jordan and Egypt are
orchestrated not really I think it's
sort of a dance if you like but I don't
think it's orchestrated by the United
States it can't possibly get anywhere it
can't get anywhere because the United
States won't tolerate a political
settlement period so it doesn't matter
what anybody does over there uh because
we we play the decisive role uh and uh a
poit everybody knows what a political
settlement means and everybody knows
that it's been attainable for at least a
decade a political settlement means a
two-state settlement on something like
the pre-june 67 borders with recognized
borders and guar territorial guarantees
and all that sort of business that's
what a political settlement means it
would probably work it supported may not
be very pretty you know may be very ugly
in fact but it would probably work uh
it's supported by virtually everybody in
the world it's supported by the Soviet
Union by Europe by the non-aligned
countries by the major Arab states been
supported by the mainstream of the PLO
for about a decade uh it's only blocked
by two categories of
rejectionists uh one who we call
rejectionists because they're the bad
guys is say Libya for instance the other
who we don't call rejectionists because
it because it's us is the United States
in Israel and the United States and
Israel have in fact led the rejectionist
camp they refuse this settlement and
Israel can do it because we support them
in their refusal and short of that there
is no political
settlement you know and uh there is no
it is impossible for any group in Israel
to uh gain any credibility in their own
Society in favor of a political
settlement until they get some support
from the United States the country is
just too dependent on the United States
so American opposition to a political
settlement uh which in fact is crucially
centered in the Jewish community and the
other so-called pro-israel communities
uh that blocks the possibility of any
group in Israel arising that could even
push for a political settlement there
and so that means there'll be continued
conflict no matter what you know no
matter what negotiations are going
on you you can see I mean this again you
know here here's another example of the
of the take take look something quite
dramatic happened about a year ago in
this regard uh about last April in May
and it tells you something about the
Press last last April and May uh Yasser
Arafat proposed explicitly uh
negotiations with Israel leading to
Mutual
recognition he proposed that in uh
statements that were widely publicized
in in France and England in Greece uh in
Asia all over the place uh Israel of
course immediately rejected it they
don't want Mutual recognition uh the
United States ignored it now what about
the Press well the press was was
fascinating in that case the New York
Times And The Washington Post that is
the national press they didn't even
report it they literally didn't report
it uh they refused to run off Eds on it
they refused to publish letters about it
one reader in Detroit wrote a letter to
the New York Times in which he said look
you guys are always dumping on arut
because he won't negotiate here he has
announced negotiation he wants
negotiations and mutual recognition
don't you think that ought to be
reported he actually got a letter back
from the foreign editor of the times
which is very rare you never get a
letter back when you write to a journal
uh and even and from particularly from
the foreign editor and I have the letter
in fact I'm publishing it uh the letter
is amazing it says uh we are familiar
with the statements by srr thought that
you um pointed out to our attention uh
however they do not represent a
significant change in his position which
incidentally is true although you
wouldn't know that from reading the New
York Times uh and then it goes on to say
if Arafat ever calls for uh negotiations
and mutual recognition you'll read it on
the front page of the New York Times
well that's Verbatim what he had called
for okay now you just couldn't have a
clearer statement saying that at the top
editorial level they're not going to
allow this to be part of History okay
all right that's the New York Times And
The Washington Post the the sort of
local quality press like say the Boston
Globe or the Philadelphia inquire or the
LA Times they reported it but they
reported it in such a way that you you
know you got to really look hard to find
it it's there you know so you could find
it if you looked the San Francisco
Herald or Herald examiner I think it's
called which has the reputation of being
about the worst paper in the country had
a front page headline an inch and a half
High running all over the front page
saying Arafat the Israel let's talk
followed by a long UPI story which gave
all the detail well that's the way it
should have been treated press now how
come how do you explain this well I
would I think it's very easy to explain
uh the point is that the San Francisco
Herald examiner is too unsophisticated
to understand what news has to be
suppressed so they just make judgment
you know on the basis of sign of
significance but the New York Times
understands very well see the New York
Times you have to understand this
somebody was talking about reading the
Press you see that when you read the New
York Times you have to recognize the
tremendous burden you know the awesome
burden that the editors bear namely they
are creating history history is what
appears in the New York Times archives
nobody's ever going to look at the San
Francisco Herald examiner archives right
but they are going to look at the New
York Times archives if you're a scholar
you know what you do is you go to the
New York Times archives so it's
extremely important to make sure that
the right things are there and not the
wrong things because that's history and
history is important you know so you
know again like I said it's kind of an
awesome burden and you got to respect
those guys and uh uh you can see if you
read the Press carefully that there's a
difference in the way the times treats
crucial issues and the way other less
sensitive papers do uh because they have
to make sure that history reads the
right way so and this just wasn't
allowed in history obviously that can't
be allowed in history you know so it's
out and you'll never find it in a book
for
instance oh
okay there are still some resources an
are saying we're going to run out of oil
Texas has done 15
years isn't that the grand
are that oh that's all true we're going
to run out of oil I mean you can worry
about the timing uh there have been no
big surprises in about this I should say
for about 30 years by the late 1940s the
oil companies who are the only people
who have the information apparently knew
pretty much where the oil was and how it
was going to last and so on and it's
kind of interesting to see what they did
about it uh one of the things see one of
the things it's very important to
realize when you're studying foreign
policy planning or even business
planning is that it's all done in the
short term people very rarely make
long-term decisions that's incidentally
inherent in
capitalism uh if you're in a competitive
capitalist economy and you make
long-term decisions before you've ever
gotten to the long term you've been
wiped out in the short term you know
like if General Motors let's say say
starts putting resources into something
that's going to pay off in 10 years
they'll be out of business in 2 years
because Ford will be working on a 2-year
plan so the net effect is that planning
is almost always very short term and
that carries over to State planning too
which is largely by corporate Executives
well all right with that background and
that has that has to do with a lot of
things like take the arms race I mean
anybody who thinks knows that the arms
race is going to blow up and we'll all
get killed but that's in the long term
and we only plan for profitability in
the short term that's in that's inherent
in the system you know uh well take the
oil business uh it was everybody in the
oil business knew in the early 1950s
that American reserves were
limited uh the United States in the
north the Western hemis well you know
the northern part of the Western
Hemisphere was in fact the world's major
oil producer until
1968 but everybody knew that's going to
run out and that the major oil reserves
are in the middle e East well you know
if you were thinking about long-term
American Security what you would do is
protect American reserves and use Middle
Eastern reserves they did exactly the
opposite what they did is set up you
know they set up the tax system and all
sorts of crazy things so that it was
more profitable to exhaust domestic
American reserves before turning to
Middle Eastern reserves well you know
from the point of view of say a 10 or 20
year period That's crazy obviously crazy
you know in terms of security or
anything else else but that's what they
did and they did it because in fact
various considerations of short-term
profitability dictated that well uh some
sometimes they're going to run out of
oil and nobody's thinking about it
because that's too far off you know we
make sure we carry out problem we carry
out short-term profitability
considerations there's very little
conservation going I mean there's some
you know in so far as the economic
system forces it there's conservation
but not rational planning for
conservation you know it's just again
profitability considerations impose
Market considerations impose a certain
degree of
conservation but real long-term planning
about sane use of energy that doesn't
exist and in fact you know if we were
really if they were even moderately
serious about this we'd recognize that
you know while conservation may be okay
for the industrial countries it doesn't
mean anything for the industrializing
countries I mean they have to have
resources of energy the kind that we
have During the period of
industrialization and we're going to let
them have it you know that's one of the
reasons why they probably can never get
out of the Trap of
underdevelopment so these are yeah I
think you're quite right that's a very
serious long-term problem but until
there's rational planning for human use
in the industrial countries it'll just
be
irrelevant will you happen to know if
it's true that somebody found a way to
turn water into hydrogen through other
infusion reaction questions I've heard
things like that but I assume they're
untrue I I I'm not a big expert on it
but I I think it's very unlikely that
you get outright deception inside the
scientific Community not because
scientists are such wonderful people but
because as I said before the world
doesn't let you get away with
it one of the fields in which you have
to be honest is
physics you can't get away with it
otherwise so I tend to be suspicious
about such things but
[Music]
yeah I was just wondering you have seem
to have a lot of healthy skepticism and
a very cynical attitude and it's not
unfounded and that's and it goes back in
history a long way with a lot of
documentation I wanted to know what it
is you counteract it with what do I
counteract it with personally you mean
or what do I counteract the step well
things like this you know I mean I think
what's encouraging is that there are
lots and lots of people out there who
really want to do something to change
things and you know what could be more
encouraging than
that about change are there enough to
bring about change well you know that's
not the kind of thing you speculate
about that's the kind of thing you try
to do something
about I don't know let's let's see you
know let's try to make there be more
people I mean look if you think about it
over a longer period the change is very
striking for example when the peace
movement began in the 60s somebody
mentioned before reminded me today that
I was very pessimistic then in fact I
was I used to spend my evenings going to
talk uh in the homes of people who would
bring together two or three neighbors
because that's the biggest group you
could get you know or we'd set up
meetings in churches where we' bring
together like six topics you know
Vietnam Venezuela Iran you know etc etc
hoping that out of that collection of
topics we could get enough people so
that the people there would outnumber
the organizer aners you know that was
going on as late as 1965 I should say
and then blew up you know now the thing
is totally different you know now
everywhere you go there's lots and lots
of people the level of sophistication
and understanding is Way Beyond what it
was in the 60s and also I think the
level of commitment like look take the
civil disobedience in last week on the
pledge of resistance there were in
Boston it's very hard to get information
around the country because one of the
lessons the Press learned in the late
60s was not to report demonstrations
since that has a stimulative effect if
you think you're alone you may not do
things if you know everybody's doing it
everywhere else you'll do it too so
that's I was never reported anymore but
uh in Boston but you know locally you
can see what happened so it doesn't
matter in Boston about I think probably
600 people or so were arrested in the
sit in in the uh Federal Building over
the Embargo and I think that that's the
largest Civil Disobedience action in
ever that I remember in
Boston uh well you know that was over at
embargo after all it wasn't over B52
bombing that's pretty impressive you
know uh it's means that there's a
tremendous difference between it was a
you know in fact the thing never got to
that point during the
60s and you know that means that there's
been a big change so are there enough
people well you know there a lot more
than there were and I think there will
be a lot more yet to come if people work
on
it hi um you mentioned you've talked a
lot about um the spectrum of opinions
that are dictated by the media and also
um objectivity and and the the U fact
that it doesn't really actually exist I
wanted to talk just for a minute and
have you address the issue of
emotionalism which is a double-sided
issue I thought you were going to go
into it when you mentioned Vietnam and
the the retrospectives that are going on
right now you see a lot in the media
right now about um honoring the Vietnam
veterans and I certainly would want to
give the impression that I was not
honoring the Vietnam veterans I have
family members that were killed in
Vietnam and but at the same time I
wanted to point out that that is
something that's going on now and I've
noticed an uprise of it in the last
couple of years that um it's it's okay
to be a hero now in fact it's really the
good thing to do is to go out there and
um kill people in other countries and on
the other side of that coin of
emotionalism is the fact that that it's
very much frowned upon being emotional
is very frowned on upon the objective
papers the ones that go into the
archives are the ones that are trusted
by people who are moderate people um
people who are related to me family
members have told me that um Israel and
Israelis are um unreasonable and
irrational and that's why they are so
militaristic they've also told me that
people who come from Latin America are
are too emotional and that's why they
have so many problems down there and I
feel like that that's something that's
supported in our press too um how do you
feel about that well uh first of all let
me I mean I don't think there's
obviously nothing wrong with being
emotional you know you'd be you did if
you you can't look at things that are
happening and not react to them
emotionally but of course you also have
to U try to be rational it's there's no
use giving the weapon of rationality to
the enemy that's too strong a weapon you
know so
uh yes obviously well you know in fact
uh uh Hume once said that reason should
be the slave of the passions meaning you
start with your emotional commitments
but then you act rationally to try you
know within those commitments that's
sort of right I think uh as far as the
you know various societies of the world
are concerned I suppose the United
States and maybe sectors of H Iran are
the craziest societies that exist you so
uh I mean for example it's very hard to
find anything anywhere in the world
world outside of maybe you know humanist
fanaticism that corresponds to
mainstream American intellectual life I
I mean that quite seriously you know I
mean a place where a president can get
up and say that the destruction is
mutual so we owe Vietnam no debt uh that
the the educated community that can hear
that is kind of off the wall you know
not no point even talking to them
anymore uh or a play or in fact you know
you you or a place where the president
can get up and say as he did last week
that Nicaragua poses a military threat
so severe that we have to have a
National Security emergency and people
don't break out in hysterical laughter
uh that country is somewhere off to the
lunatic side of Iran you know uh I don't
know of anything like that stuff
anywhere else in the world you know it's
just totally crazy you know and so among
American educated intellectuals I mean
the concept of rationality is irrelevant
because fanaticism is much too high you
know jingoist lunacy is much too high
and so on uh so and all this talk about
moderates and you know the Latin
Americans and you know I think almost
any Latin American peasant understands
more about the United States than almost
any political science department okay so
uh that's uh I'm I'm not joking I mean
that seriously uh there was another
point that you made which I forgot I was
talking about the Vietnam retrospective
oh yeah the Vietnam veterans well you
know uh first of all I don't think that
I mean should you honor people for doing
what they're sort of forced to
do I think you should pity them I don't
see why I should honor them exactly uh
uh the people you should honor are
people who showed particular courage
like
resistors they should be H
but you know but of course they're not
going to be for obvious reasons uh
because people in power don't want
resistance what they want is obedience
so they're going to honor obedience now
doesn't mean that you should revile
people who did what they were forced to
do you should pity them you know you
should support them recognize that they
have a tough life and support and inly
that's what happened mostly during the
peace movement this stuff that's going
on now about you know this uh this sort
of kind of hysterical business about the
uh you know like what's going on in
Santa Barbara if you read that where
they're having a big Revival session
where uh they organize thousands of
people and Veterans come up and they
talk about how terribly they were
treated by this or that year and so on
most of that stuff is invented in my in
my opinion or if it wasn't invented it
may have happened I'm not saying people
didn't have the experiences but it was
outside the peace move peace move was
very clear about this the peace move was
always very and those of you who are say
my age and so on will remember this the
peace move was always very clear about
the fact that the soldiers were victims
and nobody was calling them baby killers
when they came back at least nobody who
was connected with the peace movement
now you know there may have been all
sorts of marginal peripheral things but
most of this stuff is being being
concocted and uh built up uh and as a
kind of a manufactured hysteria for
essentially Jingo was
purposes well you know I don't think
there's much I don't know really I mean
I suspect that see I don't think see
it's very hard to see in fact you take a
look at the PE I don't believe about the
soldiers guilt the guilt was not the
soldiers in fact again let me say
that well see it's very hard look if
you're it's okay when you're sitting
here you know to talk about what you
should do in the field but if you're out
you know trekking through the jungle and
there's an 8-year-old kid there who may
kill you it's hard not to kill him first
you know now that was always understood
uh and in fact again if you take a look
at the peace movement literature you'll
see that there was very little
discussion of things like say Mei like
for example I wrote an article on mili
and I mentioned it about one line what I
talked about is what's happening in
Washington that's where the criminals
are you know the guys who are out in the
field there's nothing much they can do
you know it's you it's very hard under
you know conditions of combat to make
discriminations I didn't
mean psych even yeah well maybe maybe I
I think there's a lot of manufactured
hysteria going on in fact I was talking
to a Swedish reporter u a week or two
ago who was going around the country uh
she was and she went to these Santa
Barbara Sessions in particular which are
the major ones she told me it reminded
her of the Norberg rallies in the
1930s under Hitler you know and I think
that's going on there's a lot of
manufactured hysteria and the uh you
know stab in the back business and so on
and so forth and that's no joke you know
uh I think one should be very cautious
about U you know about I think one
should understand this it's part of the
way of building up more jingoist hisia
well um Berkeley for example the
question is about Berkeley going for
Reagan Berkeley was always a very
conservative town I was in I taught in
Berkeley in ' 66 and ' 67 which was the
peak of things and the a lot of young
people were involved in the movement but
you know not wealthy professionals
Berkeley is now a yucky town you know
it's wealthy professionals why shouldn't
they vote for Reagan you know he's the
guy who stuffs their pocket by stealing
from the people down in the flats you
know so you know but on the other hand
uh my daughter's a student at Berkeley
in fact nothing's getting reported but
she's been sleeping out on the steps of
sprout hole lately on the an aparte
demonstrations and I just told me the
other day that about 7,000 students were
involved in a meeting there that's quite
a
lot i' I've given talks in Berkeley in
the last couple years there's always a
lot of people interested I mean you know
that Berkeley did change and I think it
it's kind of it's it's not an accidental
change I mean I think it was manipul
partly manipulated change there's been
an off young people have been subjected
to a tremendous propaganda campaign in
the 70s and it's had some effect I mean
the the the uh what was considered most
frightening in the 60s was the fact that
young people acted on honest impulses
and that's scary so one thing that was
done in the 70s was to concoct this
narcissism story you know one of the big
PR jobs in the 1970s was to try to
convince everybody that you're
narcissistic you know you don't care
about anybody else uh of course
everybody every individual knew it
wasn't true of that person but you know
each person know it's not true of myself
you know but what you're told is the
whole culture is narcissistic you're
only supposed to be interested in
yourself and so on and so forth
therefore everyone feels well I must be
weird you know so I better play that
game too and the net effect is uh you
know that the that it does become a
cultural pattern but I don't think it's
really deep-seated in any
sense uh next time do you see U Mass
demonstrations or Civil Disobedience
having effect aside from teaching the
government to do things more deviously
and more
secretly well after all that's a big
effect see as far as the
pure uh the administration is much
tougher and meaner and that's not
because you know it's because the
objective situation has changed Central
America is a much
more see Vietnam was kind of a
peripheral interest the United States
could give up trying to conquer Vietnam
and nothing much would change in the
global scene Central America is U the
major area designated for American
robbery and has been for a long time
it's not just a matter of robbing their
resources I think the United States is
planning to uh
