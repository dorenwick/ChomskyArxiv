basic principle of anglo-american law is
what's loosely called presumption of
innocence goes back to 1215 the the
Barons extracted from the King King John
Magna Carta when part of which is the
charter of liberties which stated that
no free man can be accused without a
speedy trial before his peers otherwise
he's innocent over that enters into the
American Constitution in articles 5 and
6 and over the centuries the concept was
expanded so it went beyond freemen which
meant free man to people ultimately with
the 14th amendment to former slaves
still has limits but which it shouldn't
have so it doesn't include atoms for
illegal immigrants should but but at
anybody has been expanded in recent
years we're seeing a contraction the
concept of presumption of innocence is
being contracted of course it's not the
first time history is not steady
progress there have been periods of
regression and we're now in a period of
pretty short progression in which the
concept of presumption of innocence has
been virtually abandoned the NDAA is one
case but one of a great many so it takes
a drone warfare if you look at the
detailed descriptions of how the
president determines who's going to be
murdered the Scott chain article the New
York Times gave a detailed account
presumably leaks from the White House
it's the way they want it to be seen
effectively it gives the president the
authority to kill whoever it feels like
on suspicion
that maybe someday they'll harm us and
the suspicion can be a group of men
standing somewhere what are they doing
there actually the criticism came up and
the Justice Department there are holders
just Department responded that they are
in fact getting due process as required
by our law because the executive has
considered the matter internally King
John would have laughed with hysterical
amusement that's where we are and that's
one case there was again in the case of
drone killings there was a bit of a
controversy not much over the fact that
they killed an American citizen actually
two men his son but if you look at the
New York Times headline when he was
killed it was it captured the general
mood that some like West celebrates
death of anti-american cleric or some
phrase like that so we just celebrate
when we carry out the kind of murder of
a suspect without trial without due
process if he's anti-american maybe
government claims he did something else
maybe didn't maybe he did but that's
what trials are supposed to be for and
this holds even for people who are you
might have claimed in this case I think
legitimately that they didn't hadn't
apprehended him but it also holds her
people who were apprehended the most
striking recent cases some Osama bin
Laden he was a captured question the
legitimacy of the capture but put that
aside he was captured apprehended
defenseless no arms in under the
supervision of Navy SEALs one
possibility was to bring into the United
States and have a trial the other
possibility was too
and throw his body into the sea well we
know it was done and we know the
reaction applause presumption of
innocence well what happened to that he
was a suspect doesn't matter it made you
and I may think he's you know not even a
question about whether he's guilty but
that's we're not the ones who determine
that in fact if you look at the evidence
it's not all that overwhelming but
that's irrelevant the coming since 911
there has been a steady erosion of
fundamental civil liberties having to do
with illegal government wiretapping now
illegal no longer the even if it is by
law killing people who the executive
doesn't like detention without trial
indefinite detention that's the NDAA
case in fact in my view one of the most
serious attacks on civil liberties has
barely been discussed it was a case
initiated by the Obama administration
it's called the holder V humanitarian
law project if you want to look it up
the humanitarian law project is a legal
assistance group which was charged with
giving legal advice to an organization
that the government has placed on its
terrorist list which incidentally is an
arbitrary list which has no
justification whatsoever if you look at
its history it's pretty appalling so for
example Nelson Mandela was on the
terrorist list until about four years
ago because the Reagan administration
described them as one of the more
notorious terrorists in the world Saddam
Hussein was taken off the terrorist list
in 1982 so the Reagan administration was
free to provide him with assistance and
arms and so on and the whole the whole
idea of a state determined list of
terrorists with no recourse and
what they think is it is pretty
appalling in itself anyhow they gave
legal advice to a group on the terrorist
list and according to the Obama
administration that was material
assistance to the group now material
assistance the Terrorism had a standard
meaning it meant the you're a terrorist
I had you a gun that's material
assistance the Obama administration
expanded it to legal advice if actually
look at the wording of the court
judgment it pretty much extends to a
contact so for example i happen to have
met class on nasrallah the head of
hezbollah they could interpret that as
material assistance to terrorism if they
liked that's the that's a case brought
by the obama administration they won at
the supreme court level it was argued
for the administration by elena kagan
obama's latest Supreme Court nominee
that passed virtually without comment
but I think that's quite an astonishing
attack on freedom of speech and there
are many other examples what's happened
well you know since nine eleven the bars
are down and it's not a big surprise and
you the first you know I started having
interviews about 911 literally at while
the buildings were still smoldering
hours later and my first interviews when
I was asked what I thought the
consequences would be I said what seems
obvious every power system in the world
is going to exploit it to expand their
own power or authority regression and
violence it's an excuse to do it which
is pretty much what happened you look
around the world as you exploited by
almost any everyone and in the United
States it's been exploited this way to
Patriot Act eavesdropping huge databases
of the citizens active
which could be used for who knows what
examples like this elite assassination
at the whim of the executive and so on
that's serious it's happened before in
American history worst cases so Woodrow
Wilson's Red Scare after World War one
was much more extreme than this
destroyed the labor movement destroyed
crushed independent thought deported
thousands of people government in life
political activists the COINTELPRO
groans that were initiated actually by
the late Eisenhower administration but
they really took force in the 1960s
under Kennedy and Johnson continued into
the Nixon administration these began
with these are actions by the national
political police the FBI to try to
undermine the political dissent that's
it started targeting the Communist Party
then berto rican independence movement
the Native American movements finally
the entire new left the women's movement
the Black Panthers were black
nationalists were particular target
there was no joke it reached as far as
literal Gestapo style political
assassination the staged assassination
of Fred Hampton a black organizer in
Chicago was finally ended by court order
under the Nixon administration at least
formally ended we think it was ended and
the lot of material came out on at court
order and the congressional inquiry and
so you've really looked through what
happened it's pretty horrendous that's
right through the most liberal
administrations and into Nixon it there
was a great react or a strong reaction
to Nixon's
times after Watergate but just just talk
about my personal reaction i was asked
right away to New York Review to write
about Watergate and I said I would
though I didn't think Watergate was very
significant eskom the Watergate
exposures came out at the same time as
the COINTELPRO exposures and the latter
are far more significant than Nixon's
peccadilloes and no doubt he was a crook
and he did things that were criminal but
the worst crimes of his administration
actually were taken out of the
indictment the bombing of Cambodia for
example and what was left was things
that he shouldn't have done and were in
fact violations of law but nowhere close
to PO Intel probe let's take a look at
the reaction Watergate Norma's reaction
huge impact come into a pro barely
discussed disappear forgotten which is
not unusual unfortunately and as a sign
of the lack of concern for fundamental
civil liberties when defenseless people
are attacked marginalized defenseless
people you do to them pretty much what
you like and now it's been it was
revived again the same tendencies after
nine eleven using the opportunities
offered by a massive terrorist attack I
think we should be struggling against
that then we should recognize that the
erosion of fundamental rights is going
very far and so far that we're actually
regressing before to the period before
the 13th century where the central
foundations of Anglo American law were
laid in weak form then strengthened over
time and proved now progressing that's
not insignificant than my opinion
