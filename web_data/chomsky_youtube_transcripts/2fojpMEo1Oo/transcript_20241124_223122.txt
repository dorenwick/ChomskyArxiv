[Music]
hello and welcome to danish tv
today's very special show on danish tv
for our
pakistani audience especially and
generally for the global audience and
the guest is renowned
intellectual public intellectual worlds
number
one intellectual professor nom chomsky
the one and only welcome to the show sir
glad to be with you thank you very much
for your time and here i would request
mr
dr junaid ahmed from washington d.p
to to help us to conduct this interview
this talk this conversation
dr junaid ahmed from danish tv
right now he's in washington welcome sir
thank you very much i advise salaam
alaikum i will request you to introduce
uh if necessary if needed to the show
the topics and to the guest and please
carry on
wonderful well uh considering um the
prior conversation i had with professor
tromsky
and of course his very busy schedule
i i would suggest everyone just to go on
and click norm chomsky on google to find
out the
the bio of uh our um the most
as uh by said uh if
uh the most prominent intellectual i
think uh alive today i think that
professor tromsky sometimes
has a quibble with that earlier much
earlier quote of the new york times
but just to so i won't go into the
details
of professor noam chomsky's uh detailed
biography
but just on a personal note to say
for all of our viewers in pakistan
and throughout the world that
in my humble opinion that this we are
speaking with a man
who has literally inspired uh
roughly five to six generations of
activists and i
i know that he won't like when i say
single-handedly
but i know from my father's generation
coming from pakistan
and to my generation to my daughter's
generation
uh he is someone that literally
has done the work in his writings and
activism
that has inspired all of us and so since
we have limited amount of time i'm not
going to go into the
extraordinary uh biography of
professor noam chomsky so if professor
noam chomsky does not mind
if we can go straight into a couple of
questions pertinent questions we have
coming here
from pakistan okay wonderful
professor chomsky there's a there's a
significance to the date
uh that we are having this interview on
and that is
september the 11th 2000 2020.
now on september the 11th 2001 we all
know of the
horrible atrocities uh the terrorist
attacks that took place
in the united states and um it's
uh you know quite uh i think uh
important to kind of assess what has
gone on but before that
uh there was often a mantra heard and
i'm going to ask you because i know that
throughout this year there's been a lot
of uh very necessary
uh discussion with you about the current
crisis
uh in the united states in the world uh
and of course president trump will get
to hopefully we'll get
time to get to that as well but i do
encourage viewers to also
see a plethora of interviews with you
and talks that uh
go into very deep analysis of the crisis
right now
so i will ask you to kind of go and
rewind a little bit for our viewers
here particularly you knowing that
pakistan
and this area of the world was at the
has been at the front lines
of of this of the so-called war on
terror
uh so the first thing that i'll ask you
is that
uh this the war on terror that
uh was declared declared uh
and september the 11th in fact even
prior to that
the we heard a lot from the media from
the political
from the intellectual culture about how
this event
changed the world dramatically and
completely changed the world
now i know that you um
also considered
conceded to that point somewhat but
had a slightly different perspective on
how that event
changed the world could you speak about
that a little bit
well first of all we should bear in mind
that what happened on september 11
2001 is the second
9 11. the first one was far more serious
but the first one was perpetrated by the
united states
against another country where the united
states
overthrew a parliamentary regime
and installed a vicious dictatorship
that was chile the in terms of
affect the was far greater than what we
call 911. so if you put it in per capita
terms which are the right terms
it's as if in september 11th
uh 19 2001 uh
30 000 people had been killed uh
500 000 had been tortured uh the
government was overthrown and a vicious
dictator had been installed
carrying out torture murder and and so
on
that didn't happen on what we call 911
but it did happen on the first 9 11.
now the fact that we know one and not
the and not a much worse one
is a reflection of u.s power
when something happens to the united
states it's a tragedy
when it's a incomparable the world
changes
when the united states does it to some
other country
uh let's forget about it it doesn't
matter even though it was much worse
so it's worth keeping that in mind we
are now
talking about the second and lesser
much lesser 911. why did that change the
world
because the u.s runs the world uh
overwhelmingly
so therefore if something happens to the
united states
changes the world it's as if
we were thinking let's say of the mafia
if you murder the mafia don
murders a small shopkeeper because he
didn't pay his protection money
maybe get a small notice in the
newspaper
if somebody kills the the godfather
oh the whole world changes we'll
keep at the back of our minds so what
happened
9 11 2001 the united states was
struck for the first time
since 1812 the united states has been in
a situation of
astonishing security the united states
has been at war
just about every day since its founding
but these were wars of aggression
so therefore they're not cold wars we
now
talk about you've heard the phrase
endless war a lot of laments about how
the united states is involved in
endless wars uh in afghanistan
and somalia and so on we have to stop
these endless wars
the endless war started in 1783
to the credit of former president carter
he's one of the few people who's pointed
out that the united states has been
constantly at war throughout its history
one of the main reasons for the american
revolution was that the british
had imposed a limit on expansion
of the colonies king george
fifth and now third announced that he
produced a royal proclamation
said the colonists can't go beyond
the appalachian mountains the mountains
that
bound the eastern united states
beyond that was indian territory
the indian nations were
that that was their country the
colonists didn't want that they wanted
to expand
one of the main reasons for the
revolution as soon as the british were
out
started expanding went to war against
the indian nations
that went on right through the 19th
century
a war of extermination a violation of
treaties
essentially massacre of the indigenous
population
it was punctuated by another war which
the united states invaded
mexico took over half of mexico
like where i'm living right now in
arizona
california on all mexican territory
conquered in a war of aggression and by
the late 19th century the war
the united states was beginning to
intervene in other countries in the
region central america and so on i won't
go through the rest of the record you
know it very well
so what happened on 2001
september 11th is that the mafia don
was injured and you can't have that
so yes there was a significant change
uh the united states
redeclared the war on terror
and that's what professor tromsky that's
what i wanted to follow up with you on
that in fact um uh we do we have heard
you say
that in fact this was the second time
the united states had declared this
war on terrorism the first time being uh
during the 1980s under the reagan
administration
and one of the things that i wanted to
really uh highlight
this for is because there has been
you probably are familiar with it as
well a widespread
spread perception since the beginning of
the
this war on terror under george uh
georgia w bush that this has been a war
on islam
because of predominantly muslim
countries being invaded or being the
victims of
various occupations and invasions that
this has been a war on islam
now and i and i think that this is where
where
you mentioned that actually this is the
first of all the second time actually
that it's
it's a war on terrorism that's been
declared as well as
an interesting point that you make that
i i think that our listeners would be
really interested keen on hearing what
you mean by it
that effectively the u.s government was
at war with a
certain strand of the catholic church in
the 1980s so if you could kind of
elaborate on that
as i said the us has been at war with
just about everybody
as far as the war against the muslim
world is concerned
that's been going on for a thousand
years
one of the great historians william polk
died recently personal friend
great arabist a great historian uh
a politicist he was a member of the
national security council in the united
states a
high level actor in international
affairs
but a great historian now has a book
called
the crusaders and jihadis it's about the
thousand-year war as he calls it
of the north includes russia
against the global self which was mostly
muslim
so it's essentially a thousand what he
describes as a thousand-year war against
the
mostly muslim south uh russia of course
expanded from the
small duchy of muscovy all over
islamic territories britain
france had conquered much of the
islamic world the united states came
into the act later
before the second world war but mostly
afterwards
so yes there's been a a global war
for a mere thousand years
uh the uh we're now in a new phase of it
the war against the catholic church
began in 1962 when
pope john the 23rd called
a vatican international vatican meeting
called vatican 2 the second great
vatican council
he urged the church to
return to the gospels which they had
basically
abandoned in the 4th century when the
emperor roman emperor constantine
took over the church as
the official church of the roman empire
great historian of christianity hans
kuhn
describes this as a shift from the
church from the church of the
persecuted to the church of the
persecutors
and as he points out vatican 2 in 1962
tried to reverse that long time
uh pope john urged to return
to the message of the gospels the
gospels are basically
radical pacifist a preferential
option for the poor should be the
guiding theme
very different from what the church had
been this was picked up by
especially in latin america a few other
places by
the bishops priests
nuns lay people persons went into the
villages tried to bring villagers the
message of the gospels it's a radical
pacifist message
tried to help them organize to
take their lives into their own hands
they lived in
extremely repressive brutal societies
by the united states sometimes installed
by the united states
and as soon as the united states heard
about this
essentially went to war against the
church that's why you have a long series
of religious martyrs
right through the next several decades
and some of them
became famous like archbishop romero
was murdered while he was reading mass
this horror story ended in 1989
when six leading latin american
intellectuals jesuit priests
were murdered in the jesuit university
by an
elite unit uh armed trained
uh by directed by the united states
actually just today
in a spanish court one of the top
officers salvadorian of
salvador and officers involved in the
murder was indeed charged with the
murder
okay now it's not secret that the united
states went to war with the church
you can find it out from official u.s
documents
so right school of the americas
it's been since renamed because it got a
bad reputation
but the school of the americas which
trains latin american officers
mainly killers and murderers and
torturers
uh it has what it calls talking points
it's advertised how wonderful it is
and one of the talking points is the us
army helped defeat liberation
theology liberation theology is the
movement that developed
from vatican ii so it's true the us
army and the school of the americas
helped defeat it
uh so that's the war against the church
and something that happened but aren't
part of history
like the first september 11th that's
right
and in fact this is why i i wanted you
to highlight that because of
uh the perception you were very correct
in what you said in terms of the
historic
kind of the what you can call in the
modern parlance islamophobia
that type of that type of driven um
crusades and and other types of wars
that have taken place between
christianity and the west but of course
not just conflict but also
a lot of cooperation and so on and so
forth but
i i wanted to you to highlight this
point particularly because of
many people in in the muslim world post
uh the
september 11th 2001 attacks thinking
that well
this war on terrorism is war against the
faith
of of islam rather than having the other
kind of
objectives that actually i did want you
to get into
uh very very briefly i mean this this
the your assessment of the past
19 years of the war on terror in which
right next door in afghanistan of course
i'm in
washington dc but i'm normally in
pakistan right next door we still have
american troops
and so just a quick assessment not just
obviously of afghanistan but the chaos
created in in the middle east and so on
and so forth
uh your quick assessment of where what
that war on terrorism
has accomplished and has failed to
accomplish
that's pretty easy let's go back to
2001.
uh islamic terror first of all i should
point out one point
when you talk about islamophobia it's
very misleading
the united strongly supports the most
radical harsh islamic states
the gulf there's no islamophobia there
in fact the u.s government has had very
close relations
intimate relations strongly supports
them
now they're the harshest most
reactionary
islamic states in the world but you know
they're big favorites
right from the present so the question
is
obedience and subordination if
parts of the islamic world like the gulf
dictatorships
are obedient subordinate to the united
states they're wonderful
if they're independent you have to
destroy them
but that's true whether they're islamic
or anything else
could give you a long list of
governments been
non not at all islamic over the
christian whatever
overthrown by the us so the issue is
obedient
but let's turn to your question uh we'll
take a look at the
second world on terror uh september
2001 up till today
where was islamic terror found
in sept when the war on terror was
declared
in a small corner of uh
right on the pakis east pakistan afghan
border
little tiny area there that's where
al-qaeda was located
now that was the terrorism in september
2001.
where is it now all over the world
africa it's tearing africa apart
in the philippines
south asia in the middle east of course
all over
and it spread everywhere so one of the
effects of the war
so-called war on terror was to vastly
increase islamic terrorism
instead of being confined in a tiny area
of the
afpak border it's now all over the world
uh i don't have to tell you what
happened in the middle east
the war so-called war on terror was used
as a pretext
to do something that the
right-wing american american leadership
had
always wanted to do invade and conquer
iraq
iraq's a major prize one of the major
sources of
uh oil in the world easily accessible
it's not like digging in the uh you know
deep in some seabed you just stick a
pipe in the ground water comes up
so it's tremendous and it's right in the
midst of the middle of the main energy
producing region in the world
it's been understood by the united
states officially
since the end of the second world war
that the energy resources of the middle
east story
of an a strategic treasure
of enormous significance which the
united states must control
it's kind of like almost axiom one of
international affairs since 45.
so invading iraq would have been a
wonderful prize but
it's hard just to invade a country so
the war on terror so-called they gave a
kind of pretext with under the pretense
that there were weapons of mass
destruction we don't have to go into
that
well what did the war invasion of iraq
do
first of all killed hundreds of
thousands of people
uh created millions of refugees
uh tore the country to shreds
it instigated sharp ethnic conflicts
which hadn't existed before
i don't want to go into this because you
know it perfectly well
uh this uh these conflicts then
spread around the entire regions tearing
the region to shreds
one outgrowth of this was isis
almost almost conquered iraq it was
mainly stopped by
iranian intervention finally backed by
the united states
and spread to syria and
other in fact the whole region's in
chaos and destruction
absolutely an immense
blow against the stability and the
health of the entire
region and it's not just there then they
take the nato bombing of
libya qaddafi was not a nice guy
by any means but libya was a stable
prosperous country functioning
after the nato attack it's a total wreck
it's in the hands of war and militias
countries ruined not only that but the
tuareg tribes who gaddafi had
to whom qadhafi had handed over control
of the huge weapons supplies
i just sent them off to africa some to
the middle east
and now it's tearing west africa to
shreds
that's the nato bombing of libya
that was mainly french with the british
and the americans behind
this is the history of
a thousand years you know yes
absolutely absolutely professor chomsky
the the
the point that uh one thing that comes
up out of uh
this discussion is is
is the uh numerous amount of kind of
uh recycled orientalist uh cliches
um your of course your your late good
friend edward saeed
wrote about this about the type of
mantras the type of stereotypes about
these societies
that of course have existed throughout
the colonial period
about these being backwards savages that
need
some type of western intervention the
white man's burden or so on to kind of
rescue them
from themselves uh in afghanistan we saw
this very clearly with the
rhetoric around rescuing muslim women
from muslim men
and so on and so forth so this rhetoric
has been there for quite
a while one of the one of the things
that has uh really
i think perturbed many of us critical uh
you know critical intellectuals and
activists
is that not only have we have the neo
ferguson's
and and others who are speaking about uh
well that colonialism was not all that
bad
and perhaps some form of neocolonialism
will be good for the natives
but also um what is sad to see
is that the what we can call in
classical terms the comprador
native intelligence here of many of
these societies and i can speak for
pakistan
itself also sometimes kind of reminisce
and have nostalgia for the british raj
and they brought
us they brought us railroads taught us
english
taught us how to use forks and knives
and it always reminds me of your book uh
i read a long time ago
year 501 the conquest continues so
i i don't know i would any reflections
from you on
on on this on this very problematic
narrative
that we hear well it's true that
imperialist power and imperialist
violence
has often led to things that
the colonized power could
pick up and do something with so for
example if you take
say the soviet empire hardly benign
but take a look at bulgaria for example
in 1940 when russia
stalin was russia took over bulgaria and
peasants were
using wooden plows it was a very
backward country
20 years later they were producing heist
high-level electronic goods does that
justify the
russian takeover of eastern europe and
all the violence and destruction took
place
of course not that happens to be a
byproduct of
it and if you take a look at
india let's say which of course included
what's now pakistan
uh the uh the british built
railways for their own benefit uh
to take out the to
essentially de-industrialize india which
has been one of the
centers of world
economic and cultural development
devastated by british imperialism
but they did the british did build real
railways for their own benefit
okay now what's left of the wreckage
that britain
created it can use the railroads just as
in
bulgaria the victims of stalinist
violence can
produce electronic goods you know that's
uh
the japanese were brutal
occupiers japanese imperialism
in say korea but now taiwan was violent
and brutal
but it also laid the basis for an
industrial society
they did develop the societies to some
extent for their own
reasons and interests but they did it so
yes that's the history of imperialism
all the time uh so uh
new really class of people
called intellectuals whose task is
to justify whatever is done by
state violence and state power that's
been the
main the mainstream of intellectuals
throughout
history absolutely
and and in fact professor chomsky that
brings me very much to
uh some of your earliest essays on
towards uh
what what you call the new military
humanism
uh what your one of the essays that had
an
enormous impact on on me and my my late
father was
your essay the responsibility of
intellectuals uh and
it has been clear throughout uh your
writings and talks that it's
it's your your your ire and your
critique
is not just of the right wing uh uh
uh or the white supremacists today
whatever you want to call them but of of
liberal intellectuals
that have been complicit in in the
goals of the american empire in
particularly
in the modern area from from clinton to
obama
of the neoliberal era who have been
complicit
in the deepening the social inequalities
within
uh the united states and globally and so
that's something that i also wanted you
to speak about
because here we also have a similar
problem
in which i think the issues that you
raise about in the united states how
you how the political system uses issues
of
distraction of say religion of culture
this type of thing
um to distract from and deflect away
from the central issues of of of the
core
of the economy of the political system
and so on i think the similar thing
happens in pakistan as well when you
start to go on okay well there's these
religious issues and then there's
religious fundamentalists and then
there's nice enlightened secular liberal
elites
and so on and so forth so i think that
uh
if you can kind of enlighten us of of
what your
uh critique has been since i think the
vietnam days
of vietnam war days about kind of the
liberal intelligencia and their role
in uh in in propping up but as you say
state violence
state corporate violence in fact well
pakistan has
very deep problems uh which you know
better
about tonight like to talk about them
but there's no time
let's talk about the united states and
the liberal intellectuals
now let's start with the iraq war
there are if in the mainstream uh
say taking obama
at one extreme right-wing republicans at
the other extreme
there are two views about the iraq war
one is at the right wing
we made we
should have done it better there were
bad things that were done
at the left part so-called left obama
exactly the same obama is greatly
admired because he called the iraq war
a strategic blunder
that's a criticism of the iraq war when
the russians invaded afghanistan
the early in 1980 russian generals
said this is a strategic blunder we
shouldn't be invading afghanistan
do we honor them for that when
hitler invaded eastern europe
uh there were many
high-level german nazi officials
military officials said
this is a strategic blunder we should
knock out
england first and then turn to the east
but do we honor them
no in fact we condemn them it wasn't
just a strategic blunder it was a major
crime
the kind of crime for which people were
hanged at nuremberg
that's but the most you can say is
it was a blunder exactly the same with
vietnam
i've reviewed this in some detail
1975 when the vietnam war was over
uh everyone had to
write something about the vietnam war of
course so you get a
spectrum of commentary that's very
interesting
starts from the hawks who say we were
stabbed in the back
if we fought harder we could have won
the peace movement
the establishment the back and so on and
so forth
that's the hawks then you go to the far
left what's called the left say
anthony lewis of the new york times a
very sharp independent critic of
u.s policy about as far as he can go and
still be anywhere near the media
uh he said he wrote about it and he said
the war began with blundering
efforts to do good why
to do good because the united states
government did it
so therefore it was to do good it's an
axiom
why blundering because it failed
then he said by 1969
it became clear that it was a mistake
that the united states couldn't bring
democracy to vietnam at a cost
acceptable to itself
that's the left wing meanwhile this
happened to be another group of people
two groups in the country
one were those few intellectuals who
said
the war is not a mistake it's a crime
it's the worst crime since world war ii
well there was a name for those people
they were called
the wild men in the wings that's
mcgeorge bundy uh
kennedy johnson national security
advisor
harvard dean left intellectual
so there are the wild men in the wings
who say it wasn't just a mistake it was
a crime
there's also the population general
population
whose attitudes are very carefully
monitored expensive scope polls
the same year 1975
about 70 percent of the population in
the united states
said the war is not a mistake
it was fundamentally wrong and immoral
so there's the mainstream intellectuals
who say maybe a mistake maybe we didn't
try hard enough
then there's two other groups the wild
men and the wings
the small group of intellectuals they
say that's a major crime
and the huge majority of the american
people who say it's not a mistake it's
fundamentally wrong and immoral
but there are proud of it and of course
the wild men and the wings are out of it
that's right it's the mainstream
intellectuals
people like obama iraq war was a mistake
a strategic blunder
we honor him for that that's common and
i'm afraid i have to leave i have
another interview in one
in two minutes right professor johnson
just one last question because
on our local uh uh in in our local
setting on the
kashmir question and what's going on in
india i'm sure it's deeply painful for
you
as well who have who's visited india
many times into
inspirational places like west bengal
and kerala and so on
about your good friend arundhati roy uh
the late ekbal ahmed they wrote about
kashmir
you must be following what's going on in
in kashmir and
in india as a truly what arundhati roy
aptly distinguishes safe from say trump
uh as just representing trump not some
ideology but
modi really coming from a fascist
movement emerging from the 1920s just a
very very brief thoughts
on what's going on uh in india and
kashmir
yeah i'll say just a word about that but
first another word
wherever we are our prime concern
should be where we are in a position
to affect what happens that's typically
our own
country so for me the crucial issues are
what's done by the united states
for you the crucial issues are what's
happening in pakistan
uh we can certainly talk about india but
pakistan is the highest priority for you
just same if you're in if you're in
new delhi your highest priorities india
okay with that in the background what's
happening in india is disgraceful
uh modi is tearing shreds the
last remnants of america of indian
secular democracy which was quite lively
ineffective
in within india turning it into a
right wing in new nationalist state
highly repressive of a huge muslim
population
kashmir has just taken it over
destroying the it's all of its
autonomy the countries
has long been under military rule but
now it's just
extraordinary and it's just total
repression
uh people locked up under
massive control by the indian
military forces now this is a disaster
and regrettably
modi has high popular support
pulls through great support not only
this is tearing
the country apart but even
with a horrifying uh
policies with regard to the corona virus
which is killing huge numbers of indians
but the popular support remains it's uh
these are some of the disasters of
modern affairs
and i'm very sorry but i really have to
leave
we really understand thank you so much
professor noam chomsky
it's been quite an honor and privilege
to have you with us here
yes i'm very sorry to have to leave
right now
thank you so much professor champs
and dynasty and pakistani people we are
so much obliged
and so thankful to you for your time
thank you very much
thank you okay bye bye bye
yeah janet so
i mean we are now at what 40 minutes or
something
um and if we have a little bit more time
and if you think
we can have that discussion uh i'm
more than willing uh to kind of uh
continue
you know very limited time hog i i i
told you that in advance
so um you know he's doing interview
after interview after interview so
as much as we can get out of him and uh
is is
uh is is is a treasure trove for us did
not become
uh what we whatever knowledge we can get
from professor noam chomsky so
if there are any uh that that maybe i
can be of some
value too so i would uh be more than
willing
bhatti professor what would be your take
on south asia
south china sea engagements and
emergence of china as
players
foreign
i mean maybe just a couple of these
questions since we have a little bit of
time
uh uh throw up let's try to tackle them
uh uh if that's okay with you
yeah so so so for example and and and
very briefly
uh very briefly uh the issue of the
i mean this is this is the central issue
and obviously
uh professor trump's past time
i mean a whole lot of new geopolitical
uh arrangements that are occurring and
realignments
but of course the central big elephant
in the in the room is the rise of china
right
and so the in some ways the
reorientation
of the global order from uh a western
um kind of dominated world order
that has not only been i mean we're not
just uh
we're talking about the past 500 years
tk from 1492
to the to the present so we are seeing a
major shift
in in in world order uh we
are living in very dangerous times as
well it is an age of transition
uh a very chaotic situation
we don't know in which direction things
will go
but uh the one
one thing is very clear and and
specifically in the pakistani case
is that this is in some ways the first
time that we have the two
largest powers in the in the world if
you want to call them both super powers
at least the u.s is a super power the
china is a potential
rising superpower two superpowers two
superpowers that are dependent
right now on pakistan right
the u.s is dependent on pakistan to uh
to rescue it
in in afghanistan on the on the one hand
and on
on the second hand they also don't the
the american political establishment
does not want islamabad to become even
closer
in the into the camp of beijing into the
camp of china
so so that's why they're very careful
now and if you follow the american media
coverage of pakistan
since the past two years it is a
remarkable difference
from what you see from 2001 to 2018
you don't even see any you know negative
uh uh
uh coverage of pakistan anymore so
that's one thing
china as we all know is encircled by
american naval ships throughout the
south china sea
the malacca straits and of course
america american military bases
surrounding it so voto that just needs a
catalyst for some type of confrontation
and even a direct military
the american ships can easily blockade
the trade routes in the malacca streets
and south china sea
in which case china is utterly dependent
on the port of gwadar
what this whole the the china is energy
hungry
it it gets all of its oil reserves all
of these things
uh from uh from the primarily the middle
east
and so it is also utterly dependent on
on on pakistan uh
for for the access to this and the now
the
40 billion dollar investment they've
done in iran as well again to access
these ports
so we have a very interesting situation
here
pakistan's the the value of pakistan's
geopolitical role
uh has enormously increased
and and what's going to happen in the
in in the in east asia and the south
china sea that's uh
you know john pilcher has this very good
documentary i recommend
to our viewers on youtube it's called
the coming war with china
the interesting thing is you know we
spoke with professor chomsky
about the war on terrorism both the
the very interesting and funny thing is
in the 2020 uh national defense security
document of the united states usm
terrorism
the the major the major threats to the
us
right now are great power rivalries
and they mention them explicitly china
and russia war on terrorism terrorism
you know all of a sudden you know now we
they are now the u.s
ruling elite realizes the real
competitors
in the world order that they have to
deal with so
so so china is the rising power and due
to sahara we
do drama decree trump withdrawn
sanctions
all of this is all about this uh and now
we see with the
the 5g technology etc it's
because of the recognition that the only
country on this planet right now
that can even remotely compete with the
united states
in high tech and all of these other type
of industries that actually produces
things
i mean this corona virus issue has kind
of revealed
the uh the the i mean all of the
contradictions
uh and the inequalities uh that have
that exists in the us
and the inability of the us government
of the national governments state
governments to
actually address the issue whereas
not just china like in a whole bunch of
other east asian countries have done a
far better job
in in in controlling these things so we
are witnessing
what we can call a reorientation of the
world order
in
foreign
foreign
thank you very much inshallah thank you
