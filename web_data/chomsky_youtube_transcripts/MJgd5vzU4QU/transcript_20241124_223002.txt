thank you for accepting joining us to
our program I would like to sum a few
questions there are serious allegations
that the Turkish army use the chemical
and prohibited weapons
in the north Iraq area last two years
finally two doctors from the IPP and W
organization who visited the region
between 20 and 27 September prepared a
report doctors
called that to International Community
there is an urgent call for
investigation
the Turkish government has carried out
many serious atrocities
the 1990s the war against the Kurds of
turkey was
horrendous
crimes as they were
tens of thousands killed in
hundreds of thousands of refugees
thousands of villages destroyed every
imaginable form of torture
and since then there are many other
examples of
Turkish government atrocities so this
could be true but I have no direct
evidence so I really
can't say anything about
about the particular case the ippnw is a
highly reliable organization uh
fact the founder was a close friend of
mine but uh
I have no other independent information
ippmw actually asked to send the
independent investigation the the groups
to the area
do you support this the the in the
calling of the ippmws
in order to find the facts finding the
facts in the area would certainly make
perfectly good sense to send an
independent investigation
the if there's a way to bring it to the
United Nations
uh appeal it's they certainly should act
on it these are very serious charges
the they're coming from
an organization which in fact when the
Nobel Peace Prize
verse highly regarded a respected
organization with a highly qualified
investigators so this is certainly
legitimate case for a uh a serious
investigation
but perhaps there is a some national
government would be willing to sponsor
this initiative
perhaps the Swedish government since
they presented the Nobel Prize to the uh
IPP and w
ow
the Kurdistan Regional government and
the Iraqi government and in his press
statement on the 27th of September and
states that as the government of people
who witnessed to halapche Massacre
shouldn't prevent an independent
investigation from being carried out
what would you like to say about the
preventive the approach of the regional
government
well I don't think the
Regional government has
the
credibility to
call for a serious investigation
going back to the halabja massacre
I'm sorry to say that the country that
prevented an investigation was the
United States in fact the Reagan
Administration
refused to blame
Saddam Hussein for the
who was then supporting refused to blame
him for the massacre tried to
shift the blame to Iran Reagan himself
blocked a congressional effort to
protest it I don't know what the United
States would say today
but I think
the regional government is not in a
position to do very much has to be one
of the major States
which could perhaps approach the United
Nations
who ought to be the source of an
investigation
either
the U.N itself or one of its
subsidiaries
after the publication of the reports on
12th of
October and also the image of two KKK
fighters who were reported to have lost
their lives due to chemical
depositioning chemical agents were
published after that the shednab
professor Dr shabnam Karol finjanji one
of the most leading forensic expats and
the head of the Turkish Medical
Association
talked to all the television and she
taught what the what she have seen
actually what she has seen on the
picture and he said she said the same
things actually it has to be
independently investigation necessary
after that the Turkish States the Hasley
has arrested the professor Dr shadnam
what would you like to say about of this
situation because the world's most known
the forensic expert just talked about
the situation and invite to uh invite to
the independent the investigation in
region
no
we don't really need
more evidence that the
Turkish government is
highly
repressive authoritarian government
uh naturally
uh
any decent person should strongly
protest this
but
an effective protest is going to have to
come from some
International
uh organization or state with some
enough credibility to reach the General
Public
I can protest but that doesn't mean
anything
so
well I think the
most likely
possibility is to
have some State maybe Sweden approach
the
United Nations and call for an
investigation of these extremely serious
charges
the Turkish States didn't as such any
allegations about the chemical the
agents chemical gas uses in the region
so in this case shouldn't they say
common and let's do investigation
yes of course they shouldn't but they're
not going to do it they should also
accept the
investigation of the Hideous crimes that
they committed in the 1990s or recent
crimes crimes enough foreign
in their invasion of
Kurdish areas in Syria lots of things
they should do but you can't accept you
can't expect criminal states to carry
out investigations of their own crimes
the United States does not investigate
its own crimes they call for
investigation of others crimes and the
Turkish state is not going to be any
more responsible than the United States
or France or Britain so yes they should
but they won't unfortunately that's not
the way
the world of power operates the world of
power operates under pressures
popular pressures
which sometimes translate into
government pressures
but it's not many you sing here's what
they ought to do there's lots of things
that are powerful ought to do but they
won't do it unless under severe pressure
and what are the humanitarian
responsibilities of the International
Community uh other than the states
met the International Community
has the responsibility
to
bring to the General Public
severe violations of human rights
to organize public efforts to compel
state power to respond to them
sometimes this can be achieved
often it's extremely difficult
we we know what the responsibilities are
then comes the task of trying to fulfill
them which takes extreme effort
for I'll just give an example
take the
Turkish atrocities against
Turkish Kurds in the 1990s some of the
most serious
they were all carried out with extensive
U.S government support
in fact the Clinton administration
gave more Aid
to turkey at the peak moment of the
crimes
1998 more than the entire period
prove
to the initiation of the Turkish
counterinsurgency operations
a number of us tried very hard simply to
bring this fact to the public
press wouldn't report it New York Times
had a
Bureau in Ankara they wouldn't report it
uh
if you give talks and you can try to
reach journalists it's extremely hard to
break through
takes real organized effort so we know
the responsibilities
task of carrying them out
is of major difficulty and the some
journalists who published about these
allegations also arrested after the
publishing their news and the nine of
our colleagues now in the jail and what
would you like to say about your
solidarity with our the journalists the
comrades
just
we support them
we wish them
courage
in facing the harsh circumstances to
which they're being subjected
and we will do everything we can
to
bring their
brutal treatment to
public attention
to organize efforts to end these
atrocities so be strong
know that there are many people who
greatly respect what you're doing
and are dedicated to trying to give you
whatever help they can
thanks
