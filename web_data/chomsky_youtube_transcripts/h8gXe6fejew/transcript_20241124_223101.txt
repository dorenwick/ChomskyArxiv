We're delighted and honored to welcome Professor 
Noam Chomsky today to Facing Future, renowned  
author, political scientist, speaker of truth and, 
most of all, wise dissident who, like Socrates,  
has spent his life challenging power policies 
and institutions that are harming our planet  
and threatening our survival. Stuart Scott is the 
executive producer, founder and guiding light of  
‘Facing Future’ and although Stuart has cancer, 
he continues and is with us today. And I’m Dale  
Walkonen, a former professor of communications 
and Stuart’s co-host. Welcome Professor Chomsky!
So, I thank you very, very much 
for taking the time to talk to us  
now. We're pleased >>>So, tell me about... 
tell me about yourself. >>>Well, as can be 
seen, I have a bit of a physical disability. 
More than... more than a 
simple one. I’ve had cancer. 
I’ve got fourth stage cancer and it has 
invaded the spine and so I’m hunched forward  
so we've adjusted everything, and you can see my 
ceiling so that I can see you. If I would look  
straight out, you wouldn't see me, so thank you 
very much for recording under these circumstances. >>>You 
have a chance to talk. What kind of things are 
you doing and thinking? >>>Well, I am thinking -  
you know - I don't think about death at all. I’m 
not afraid of death. For me it's a transition. I  
have a very, very solid 'spiritual grounding' 
I’ll call it, but it's more esoteric. It's the  
way... it's the way Socrates and Plato regarded 
death... as transition. >>>He looked forward to it,   
it was going to free his soul from the 
constraints of the body. >>>Yes.>>>He'd philosophized  
properly. >>>So but I would like to ask you, and 
that might be a good place to start right there is  
your view of your life and your 
own afterlife. What is your...
what is your conviction about life and after life?
>>>Well, I can't... I wish I could accept 
Socrates and Plato, but my own feeling is  
we have a certain time on Earth. We should 
do the best with... of it that we can.  
Then we leave the world to others. >>>That works. 
That works. Do the best while we're here and then  
leave it to others. >>>Okay, we're 100 
seconds to midnight on the Doomsday Clock. 
We've always been several minutes, 12 
minutes, >>>that was last January... we  
may even be closer now. The... I don't know 
if you saw it, but a couple of days ago,  
a draft report of the IPCC was 
leaked and published by the  
French Press Agency. A couple of other... a 
couple of newspapers. It's much more grim than the  
earlier reports. Well, this is a draft.
By the time it reaches publication, they may  
tone it down, but it doesn't look 
good with regard to nuclear weapons.  
Situation is more dangerous than it 
was at the time of the last report. 
New weapon systems are being 
developed, very destructive ones.
The confrontation the Biden administration 
- much to my distress - has expanded on  
the confrontational status of the Trump 
administration. Biden's trip to NATO basically  
instructed NATO to adopt something like the 
strategic planning of the Trump administration,  
preparation for two wars against China and Russia, 
which is beyond insanity. I mean no words for it. 
They're also carrying out provocative acts 
in areas where diplomacy and negotiations are  
required. Now remember that the bullet, the 
atomic sign, the doomsday clock, report that you're  
sighting--- had three basic reasons why they were 
keeping the clock at 100 seconds to midnight:  
One was global warming, one was nuclear 
war; the third was disinformation,  
the collapse of any rational discourse 
which makes it impossible to deal with the  
two major problems. That's gotten much 
worse. I mean, among Republicans,  
there's almost a disappearance of even a pretense 
of rational discourse. 25 percent of Republicans  
believe that the government is run by an elite 
of satanic pedophiles who are engaged in  
sexual traffic… trafficking of children… 70 
percent of Republicans believe that the election  
was stolen. It goes on: 15 percent of Republicans 
think that global warming is a serious problem.  
We're living in a world of total illusion and 
fantasy, and unless that's changed significantly  
and rapidly, it's not going to be possible 
to deal with the major issues, nuclear war,  
global warming, within the time span that we 
have available, which is not very long. I mean,  
you've seen the reports of UFOs that the 
government can't identify. Presumably, it's  
nothing, but if we like to believe that there are 
aliens on those UFOs, if they're reasonable they  
would be fleeing from the Earth as rapidly as they 
can to get away from this. >>>We identify people with  
their job, and the jobs that we need to change are 
coal miners. People are not permanent or defined  
by their job but we have it in our society, but we 
have a Sunrise Movement, there's a young movement  
that wants to have a civilian climate corps 
with green jobs and training. Do you think that  
Biden and company could get this through, despite the 
Republican obstructionism? >>>Well, actually that's  
one area where there's good news. The United Mine 
Workers, the major in West Virginia, Wyoming,  
the main coal mining areas, just agreed… the 
president of the mine workers agreed to a program  
of transitioning mine workers from coal mining 
to sustainable energy with government programs to  
help them financially make the transition, move 
to better jobs, better lives, kept in coal mines.
In California, oil-based state, 19 unions just 
agreed to a similar program. Of course, that's  
not a very expensive program. There aren't 
that many people involved. They can be easily  
helped to move towards better jobs, better 
life, and save us from the destruction.  
Most of that is work by my friend and co-author 
Robert Pollin. We had a joint book on this on  
the global Green New Deal recently, mainly 
based on his work. He's done extensive  
scholarly work on… careful work on feasible 
ways to overcome the climate crisis, but he's  
also been an activist, working hard with unions and 
local communities to try to work on how they can  
adapt themselves to the change that has to take 
place. And there's been success on those fronts,  
so that's good news. If you want some bad news, 
the OPEC, the, well, the oil producing cartel,  
is meeting right now and according to the reports 
in the business press, they're planning to  
increase investment and production of 
fossil fuels, because the price is going up.  
Totally suicidal! Saudi Arabia is the major 
country. They can produce more fossil fuels and  
gain more wealth for the super-rich who run the 
country. Meanwhile the country will be destroyed.  
It'll be uninhabitable in a few years, but 
whatever is going on in the minds of human beings…  
they are capable of saying: let's destroy 
ourselves; let's destroy life for our children,  
because I can make a few more dollars tomorrow. 
I wish I don't have anything to do with that…  
that's the world we live in, and we're seeing a 
lot of that. I mean, even on the Covid crisis,  
which is serious, but much less serious than - say -
the climate crisis. I mean, the wealthy countries  
are basically monopolizing vaccines for 
themselves; few gestures to the rest of the world,  
but the leaders who do this know that this 
policy is suicidal for themselves. If we don't  
rapidly vaccinate Latin America, Asia, Africa, 
the virus will mutate as it's already doing.  
There will be new forms, which are more lethal, 
more contagious that we won't be able to control.  
They'll come back to the rich countries, but even 
knowing that, the leadership of our own countries,  
the most educated, civilized, advanced countries 
in the world are saying: let's monopolize the  
vaccines for ourselves and not send them to people 
who need them. It's astonishing. If there is any  
extraterrestrial intelligence, which I rather 
doubt, but if there is and if it's watching  
what's happening on Earth, they wouldn't believe 
it. >>>Well, we lack an understanding of ourselves as  
human beings. The quote ‘homo sapiens’ is almost 
a laughable meme, as we are not wise beings,  
not wise men; we identify ourselves with our 
nationality. We're French, we're American,  
or with our state, I'm from 
Mississippi… I’m from Arkansas,  
instead of understanding ourselves as human beings 
first. Do you think there's a way that - you  
know - through the forces of our technology and 
our society - we might be able to reawaken that  
awareness of humanity, as all of us together… 
is there… do you see any hope in that direction?
>>>There has to be a way; there are 
opportunities. We have ways of reaching people,  
trying to persuade them, bring them to 
comprehend the enormity of what we face,  
and what has to be done. The 
opportunities do exist… evaluate how  
likely success is, but we do know 
that we have to dedicate ourselves  
with energy and commitment to using the 
opportunities that we have, to try to achieve... 
much time. We don't have much time. If the 
Republicans come back to office next year, 2024,  
may be too late. The programs they were 
pursuing, particularly under Trump,  
are offer no hope for survival. Going back 
to the Doomsday Clock, which you mentioned.  
As I’m sure - you know - every 
year that Trump was in office, the  
minute hand was moved closer to midnight. 
Finally, the analysts just gave up.  
It's shifted from minute hands to the 
second hand, and if they return to power,  
it's very likely that it will be a… probably 
a death knell for organized human society.  
There are, however, opportunities. Now we 
have to grasp them; doesn't matter what the  
probability is. We don't know anyway, but it can 
be done, and we don't have a lot of time to do it.
>>>Well, we are makers of memes in our society. 
We paraphrase, we send down echo chambers  
of our own making, certain ideas. This can 
be a sword that goes both ways. Of course,  
there can be satanic pedophiles and there can 
also be… there is no Planet ‘B’. Fridays... >>>We  
do get caught in echo chambers. That's 
one of the tragedies of the internet.  
There was hope that the internet would 
provide opportunities for education,  
enlightenment, informing one another, deliberating 
with one another - it's happened to some extent,  
but it's been pretty much overwhelmed by what 
you just described: the tendency to retreat into  
bubbles of self-reinforcement, separating 
ourselves from others, not speaking to others.
>>>Motivated by money… motive… motivated by 
advertising, those bubbles are created  
as audiences to sell to… >>>Well, we do live in a 
global civilization. Our products come from all  
over the world. Our food comes from all over the 
world. This has been consumerism on a grand scale.  
But global civilization could also mean something 
positive. It could mean laws and agreements,  
where we can actually come together, and 
we actually do need a global agreement. [It's a possibility]
We're herd animals. We follow… we follow a leader. 
Do you see any leaders that you would admire,  
or you think can guide us out of this? >>>I think 
there are decent and respectable people in the  
leadership class, but the change has got to 
come from below. It's got to come from the  
general population, so let's take a 
concrete example. Right now, Congress has  
passed a resolution, not legislation, but 
a resolution, calling for a Green New Deal ; it
was introduced by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed 
Markey, senior senator from Massachusetts. It's  
a very good proposal. It's a detailed proposal 
which would show… which is very similar to the  
ideas of the International Energy Association 
of my colleague Robert Pollin, who's done  
the most detailed work on this, touches all the 
bases, shows what we have to do, very feasible,  
less expenditures than the treasury 
used to bail out Wall Street  
after the Covid epidemic. It's not without reach. 
It's… how did it get there? Well, it got there with
extensive activism; groups like the Sunrise 
Movement, young people who have been working hard,  
occupied Nancy Pelosi’s office, got some support 
from Ocasio-Cortez and Markey, were trying to  
blockade entries to the White House; they tried as a 
protest, to try to get them to move this forward,  
move it from resolution to legislation. 
So, there are - to answer your question - 
there are good people, like Ocasio-Cortez and 
Markey, but they're not going to get anywhere  
unless there's extensive popular pressure,  
compelling the legislative authorities, Congress, 
the White House, to pursue these objectives.  
Perhaps you recall, there's an anecdote which may 
or not be true about Franklin Delano Roosevelt  
back in the mid-1930s, who said he wanted 
to pass New Deal legislation. He said:  
you have to make me do it, I can't do it myself. 
You have to make me do it by creating the public  
pressure and understanding which will carry 
these measures through, and that's in fact  
what happened. CIO organizing militant labor 
action, lots of political activism, and organizing  
reached a point where the Supreme Court… there 
was a - just like today - a very reactionary  
Supreme Court - it switched instead of killing 
all the legislation, began to authorize it.  
Business community reluctantly 
accommodated to the New Deal programs.  
We moved forward to a better world. 
This is my childhood. I remember  
very well. The memories are very much alive. 
Well, we're in a similar situation. If...
Biden is not Roosevelt, but if he can be pressured 
by an organized activist public, there's a chance…  
there's a chance that we can get over these 
crises. It's certainly not going to be easy.  
We might also remember something else about the 
1930s - my childhood again. There was a deep  
depression, much worse than anything we've 
seen since. Mass starvation, pretty awful.  
All over the… all over most of the world, not just 
the United States. There were basically two ways  
out. One way out was the New Deal, social 
democracy. The other way out was fascism.  
Well, it's not the 1930s, but basically, 
we have something like those choices.  
>>>Fascism seems to be on the rise around 
the world. We have people like Bolsonaro,  
and even the Indian president Modi, just doing 
incredibly despicable… The vaccines are made in  
India and they're exporting them to the 
rest of the world, while their people die,  
but I wonder - you know - the law yield dr 
said whatever name protects privilege, but  
the law can also be this powerful tool that 
we need to create laws. Do you have faith in  
legal challenges? Can we reign in the fossil 
fuel industry with legal remedies? >>>I’ve been…  
I’ve been very silent compared to my usual 
activity. I’ll apologize for that as part of my  
condition - you know -  but at this 
particular point I’d like to interject.  
There's a heck of a lot going on 
in the legal domain. The agenda…
I’ll call it ‘movement’ in the Netherlands that 
got the Supreme Court of the Netherlands to say  
that the Netherlands were not doing enough 
and then they went back a second time and  
got the same judgment. It's like ‘I told 
you once, I told you twice, get with it’.  
I happen to know a couple of the attorneys who 
are part of that. Unfortunately, attorneys are not  
trained activists and so we need activism around 
them to create the pressure in many countries  
for legal remedies. >>>That's correct. It's the 
activist pressure that can create the environment  
in which more progressive, constructive decisions 
and legislations can take place. Without them...
>>>Without them I fear the worst.
>>>Well, it behooves us all to put pressure 
and to get to the streets and to continue  
to affect our politicians and to continue 
to - you know - whatever the phone calls  
and letters may seem hopeless, they still are 
necessary for any hope of changing the way that  
the laws work in this land. >>>They're not hopeless 
though. That's a misconception. Click sign in  
and an online petition is almost valueless. It's 
like a few thousand signatures. Who cares. If you  
write that one letter? It's worth several thousand 
click signs so my activism, my idea of activism is  
get out those shoes and clean them off and go 
down there and slam your hand down and say I  
demand that you take action! Go down… >>>Sorry, 
you're talking about your form of activism,  
your mind. My favorite form of acting… of activism 
is to advise people to go down to the office  
of their congressional delegation and slam 
their hand down and say: I demand that you  
take action on this. Whoa! How many people 
come in here and demand anything of us?  
Then you're talking about million-to-one 
shot. Million-to-one.. >>>Very true! That's how the  
Sunrise Movement managed to get the movement on 
the Green New Deal by occupying the office of,  
yes, Nancy Pelosi, that was effective. >>>Okay, well, 
thank you, thank you so much for talking with us.  
I know how busy you are. I know how ...
>>>A lot of work to do on all these issues.  
Wonderful to have a chance to talk to you. >>>Thank 
you so much. >>>To paraphrase Socrates: dissidents  
like gadflies may be easy to swat, but the cost 
to society of silencing their constant buzzing is  
very high. We hope that humanity will not pay the 
ultimate price for its failure to listen to you.  
Thank you, Noam. It's been an honor and 
a privilege to speak with you today. Bye.
