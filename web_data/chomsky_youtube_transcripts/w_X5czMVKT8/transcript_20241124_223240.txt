- Good evening.
My name is Mary Watson.
I'm Executive Dean at The New School,
and it is my distinct pleasure
to welcome all of you here
tonight to our event
featuring Noam Chomsky
on power and ideology.
As I'm sure all of you in this room know
Noam has been described
with many accolades
among them as being widely regarded
as one of the foremost
critics of US foreign policy
in the world.
I also welcome our
livestream audience tonight
and invite you on livestream to comment
during the evening's presentation.
For nearly 100 years,
The New School has had
a long, long history of
intellectually questioning
the dominant discourses,
supporting dissident voices
and reframing and embracing debate.
In the 1930s, we established
what was then called
the university and exile,
a project where The New School embraced
scholars and activists
who were facing exile
and indeed extermination
on the global stage.
We created here an intellectual haven
for advancing progressive ideas
that literally would not
have survived elsewhere.
And now today, we still at The New School,
continue this tradition, for example,
awarding this year, the Syrian
Anonymous Media Collective,
Abounaddara, with our 2015 Vera List Prize
for art and politics.
Next month, we will
welcome representatives
from this collective who are advancing
the rights of individuals
in the Syrian society
to be represented by their own images
at a time when our dominant media images
include those of millions
of people exiled from Syria.
So as part of this long
intellectual tradition,
The New School is honored
tonight to welcome Noam Chomsky,
MIT Professor Emeritus of
linguistics and philosophy.
Noam was born in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
He studied linguistics,
mathematics and philosophy
at the UPENN where he received his PhD.
Noam's been at the Massachusetts
Institute for Technology
for many years, now serving
as Emeritus Professor.
Chomsky is a prolific author
who has written and lectured
widely on linguistics,
philosophy, intellectual history,
contemporary issues,
international affairs,
and foreign policy.
He has a long and illustrious lineage,
including for example,
tonight, we are shortly before
the 50th anniversary of the publication
of his classic essay, The
Responsibility of Intellectuals,
which appeared in the
New York Review of Books
in February, 1967.
Chomsky has received more than
two dozen honorary degrees
from places including the
University of Chicago,
Delhi University, the
University of Pennsylvania,
Cambridge, the University of Buenos Aires,
Harvard, the University of
Calcutta and many others.
He is a Fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences
and of the National Academy of Science
and recipient of many awards,
including the Distinguished
Scientific Contribution Award
of the American Psychological Association,
the Kyoto Prize in Basic
Sciences, the Helmholtz Medal,
and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award.
Noam's most recent books include
The New York Times best sellers
Hegemony or Survival, and Failed States,
and other books including
Imperial Ambitions,
What We Say Goes, Interventions,
Hopes and Prospects, Occupy,
and Masters of Mankind.
He has written several
provocative books on 9/11.
So now I'd like to
introduce our co-sponsor
of tonight's event, Haymarket
Books's Anthony Arno,
who will introduce the event, welcome.
(audience applauding)
- Thanks, thanks Dean Watson,
and thanks to The New
School and all of you
for coming out tonight.
It's really a privilege for
all of us at Haymarket Books
to be part of this occasion,
just a few housekeeping announcements
and a few people we want to
thank before we get started.
Pamela Tillis has been an amazing partner.
She's the director of public
programs at New School
and has done a series of
terrific events with us
at this and other spaces.
And we really value her
amazing skills and commitment
to public programming
that not only services
the remarkable community
at The New School,
but so many other communities
throughout the city.
There's a livestream team.
We want to acknowledge their hard work
in making it possible for the
people in the overflow rooms,
but also people all around
the world to be able
to watch tonight.
Democracy Now is here and are filming.
So check out this
broadcast on Democracy Now.
(audience applauding)
There are a few other
people who do a lot of work
behind the scenes to make
events like this happen.
We're very honored to have our friends
from Lannan Foundation here
who have been instrumental
in the success and the
growth of Haymarket Books
over the last 14 years
of our program and work
as an independent publisher.
So we want to acknowledge
Lannan Foundation
for their invaluable
support for our authors
and for our publishing program.
Also I want to thank all the volunteers
who make it possible for
Haymarket Books to do what we do.
A few housekeeping announcements,
please turn off your
National Security Agency
tracking devices.
(audience laughing)
I know everyone has their new iPhones,
but please silence them, turn them off.
Let's just be here now
for a few minutes together
without any Sex in the City ring tones.
Noam has pre-signed books,
so if you go to the lobby
at the Haymarket table,
you'll find a vast array
of his titles.
Many of them that he signed
just about an hour ago.
There are also sign-up sheets.
You'll find out there to
find out about more events
being sponsored by The New School,
also events being sponsored
by Haymarket Books,
such as Monday night's event
at Nuyorican Poets Cafe
with Boots Riley and Hari Kondabolu.
So check that one out if you can.
There are people who will be
going through the audience
with note cards to get your questions.
If you're on the live stream,
you can send in questions
and we'll be sending those up to Noam
at the end of his talk.
And just briefly, I have had the privilege
of introducing Noam on
a number of occasions,
and there's so much that one can say
about the immense contribution he's made,
but I think it really boils
down to one very simple point,
which is that Noam Chomsky
embodies more than any person
I think in our lifetimes,
the meaning of the word "solidarity",
and that is something profoundly
important in today's world.
So please join me in
welcoming Noam Chomsky.
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)
- Thank you.
The role of concentrated power
in shaping the ideological framework
that dominates perception, interpretation,
discussion, choice of action.
All of that is too familiar
to require much comment.
Tonight, I'd like to discuss a
critically important example,
but first, a couple of
words on one of the most
perceptive analysts of this
process, George Orwell.
Orwell is famous for his
searching and sardonic critique
of the way thought is controlled by force
under totalitarian dystopia,
but much less is known is his discussion
of how similar outcomes are
achieved in free societies.
He's speaking, of course, of England.
And he wrote that "although
the country is quite free,
nevertheless unpopular
ideas can be suppressed
without the use of force".
He gave a couple of examples,
provided a few words of explanation,
which were to the point.
One particularly pertinent
comment was his observation
on a quality education in the best schools
where it is instilled into you
that there are certain things
that it simply wouldn't do to say,
or we may add, even to think.
One reason why not much
attention is paid to this essay
is that it wasn't published.
It was found decades later
in his unpublished papers.
It was intended as the introduction
to his famous Animal Farm,
bitter satire of
Stalinist totalitarianism.
Why it wasn't published
is apparently unknown,
but I think perhaps you can speculate.
Orwell's observations on
thought control under freedom
come to mind in considering
the raging debate today
about the Iran nuclear deal,
which currently occupies center stage.
I should say it's a raging
debate in the United States,
virtually alone.
In almost everywhere else,
the deal has been greeted
with relief and optimism
and without even parliamentary review.
This is one of the many striking examples
of the famous concept of
American exceptionalism.
The fact that America
is an exceptional nation
is regularly intoned by
virtually every political figure.
And I think more
revealingly the same is true
of prominent academic
and public intellectuals.
I can select almost at
random, take for example,
the professor of the science
of government at Harvard,
this distinguished liberal
scholar, government advisor.
He's writing in Harvard's
prestigious journal,
International Security.
And there, he explains that
unlike other countries,
the national identity of
the United States is defined
by a set of universal
political and economic values,
namely liberty, democracy, equality,
private property and markets.
So the US has solemn duty to maintain its
international primacy for
the benefit of the world.
And since this is a matter of definition,
we can dispense with the tedious work
of empirical verification.
(audience laughing)
So I won't spend any time on that.
Let's turn to the leading left
liberal intellectual journal,
the New York Review.
There, a couple of months ago,
we read from the former Chair
of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace
that American contributions
to international security,
global economic growth,
freedom and human wellbeing
have been so self-evidently unique
and have been so clearly
directed to others' benefit
that Americans have long believed
that the United States
amounts to a different
kind of country.
While others push their
national interests,
the United States tries to
advance universal principles.
No evidence is given, because it's again
(audience laughing)
a matter of definition, and
it's very easy to continue.
It's only fair to add
that there's nothing at all exceptional
about this American exceptionalism.
It was standard for every great power,
very familiar from other
imperial states in their days
in the Sun, Britain, France, others.
And this is true.
Interestingly, even from
very honorable figures,
from whom when might
have expected be better.
So John Stewart Mill,
for example, in England,
to mention a significant case,
which raises interesting
questions about intellectual life
and intellectual standards.
Well, in some respects,
American exceptionalism is not in doubt.
I just mentioned one example,
the current Iran nuclear deal.
Here, the exceptionalism
of the United States,
its isolation is dramatic and stark,
and there are actually many other cases,
but this is the one I'd like
to think about this evening.
And in fact, US isolation
might soon increase.
The Republican organization,
I hesitate to say "Party",
is dedicated to undermining
the deal in interesting ways
with the kind of unanimity
that one doesn't find
in political parties,
though it's familiar in
such former organizations
as the old communist party,
democratic centralism.
Everyone has to say the same thing.
That's one of many indications
that the Republicans are
no longer a political party
in the normal sense,
despite pretensions, commentary and so on.
Rather, the former Republican
Party has now become
a radical insurgency
that's abandoned parliamentary politics.
I'm quoting two highly
respected, very conservative
political commentators, Thomas
Miller and Norman Ornstein
of the right-wing American
Enterprise Institute.
And in fact, they may succeed
in increasing sanctions
and even secondary
sanctions on other countries
and carry out other actions
that could lead Iran
to opt out of the deal
with the United States
With the United States, that is
that, however, need not mean
that the agreement is
nullified, contrary to the way
it's sometimes presented here.
It's not a US-Iran agreement.
It's an agreement between
Iran and, what's called,
V five plus one, the
five veto-holding members
of the Security Council plus Germany.
And the other participants might agree
to proceed Iran as well.
They would then join China and India,
which have already been finding ways
to evade the US constraints
on interactions with Iran.
And in fact, if they do,
they'll join the large majority
of the world's population
of the non-aligned movement,
which all along has vigorously
supported Iran's right
to pursue its nuclear programs
as a member of the NPT.
But remember that they're not part
of the international community.
So when we say the
international community opposes
Iran's policies,
or the international community
does some other thing,
that means the United
States and anybody else
who happens to be going along with it,
so we can dismiss them.
If others continue to honor
the deal, which could happen,
the United States will be
isolated from the world,
which is not an unfamiliar position.
That's also the background
for the other element
of Obama's, what's called, Obama's legacy,
his other main foreign policy achievement,
the beginning of normalization
of relations with Cuba.
On Cuba, the United States has
been almost totally isolated
for decades.
If you look at the annual votes
in the UN General Assembly
on the US embargo,
they're rarely reported,
but that the US essentially votes alone.
Now the last one, Israel
joined, but of course,
Israel violates the embargo.
They just have to join because
have to join with the master.
Occasionally the Marshall Islands or Palau
or someone else joins.
And in the hemisphere,
the United States has been
totally isolated for years.
The main Hemisphere
Conferences have foundered
because the United States
will simply not join
the rest of the hemisphere
in the major issues
that are discussed.
Last one in Columbia, the two
major issues were admitting
Cuba into the Hemisphere.
Us and Canada refused,
everyone else agreed.
And the US drug war, which
is devastating Latin America,
and they want to get out of it.
But the US and Canada don't agree.
That's actually the background
for Obama's acceptance
of steps towards normalization
of relations with Cuba.
Another Hemispheric Conference
was coming up in Panama.
And if the United States
had not made that move,
it probably would've been
thrown out of the Hemisphere.
Therefore, Obama made what's called
your noble gesture of courageous move
to end Cuba's isolation.
Although in reality, it was US isolation,
that was the motivating factor.
So if the United States
ends up being almost
universally isolated in
Iran, that won't be anything
particularly new.
And in fact, there are
quite a few other cases.
Well, in the case of Iran,
the reasons for US concerns
are very clearly and
repeatedly articulated,
Iran is the gravest threat to world peace.
We hear that regularly from high places,
government officials, commentators,
others in the United States.
There also happens to be a world out there
and it has its own opinions.
It's quite easy to find these
out from standard sources
like the main US polling
agency, Gallup Polls,
takes regular polls of
international opinion.
And one of the questions that is posed
is which country do you
think is the gravest threat
to world peace?
The answer is unequivocal,
the United States
by a huge margin, way behind
in second place is Pakistan.
It's inflated surely by the Indian vote
and then come a couple of others.
(audience laughing)
Iran is mentioned, but along with Israel
and a few others, way down.
That's one of the things
that it wouldn't do to say.
And in fact, the results that are found
by the leading US polling
agency, didn't make it
through the portals of what
we call the free press,
but it doesn't go away for that reason.
Well, given the reigning
doctrine about the gravity
of the Iranian threat,
that we can understand
the virtually unanimous stand
that the United States
is entitled to react
with military force that
unilaterally, of course,
if it claims to detect
some Iranian departure
from the terms of the agreement.
So again, picking an
example virtually at random
from the national press,
consider the lead editorial last Sunday
in the Washington Post.
It calls on Congress, I'll quote,
"to make clear that Mr.
Obama or his successor
will have support for
immediate US military action,
if an Iranian attempt to
build a bomb is detected",
meaning by the United States.
So the editors, again, make it clear
that the United States is exceptional.
It's a rogue state, indifferent
to international law
and conventions, entitled to
resort to violence at will.
But the editors can't be
faulted for that stand
because it's almost universal
among the political class
in this exceptional nation.
Although what it means is,
again, one of those things
that it wouldn't do to say.
Sometimes the doctrine takes
quite a remarkable form
and not just on the right, by any means.
So take, for example,
the Clinton doctrine,
namely the United States is
free to resort to unilateral use
of military power, even for such purposes
as to ensure uninhibited
access to key markets,
energy supplies, and strategic resources,
let alone security or alleged
humanitarian concerns.
And adherence to this doctrine
is very well confirmed
in practice as need hardly be discussed
among people willing to look at the facts
of current history.
Well, the Washington Post
editors also make clear
why the United States should be prepared
to take such extreme steps
in its role of international primacy.
If the United States is not prepared
to resort to military force, they explain,
then Iran may, "Iran
may escalate its attempt
to establish hegemony over
the Middle East by force".
That's what President Obama
calls, Iran's aggression,
which we have to contain.
For those who are unaware of
how Iran has been attempting
to establish hegemony over
the Middle East by force
or might even dream of doing so.
The editors do give
examples, two examples,
its support for the Assad
regime and for Hezbollah.
Well, I won't insult your intelligence
by discussing this demonstration
that Iran has been seeking
to establish hegemony
over the region by force.
However, on Iranian aggression,
there is an example,
I think one in the last
several hundred years,
namely Iranian conquest of
two Arab islands in the Gulf
under the US-backed regime of
the Shah back in the 1970s.
Well, these shocking Iranian efforts
to establish regional hegemony by force
can be contrasted with
the actions of US allies,
for example, NATO ally, Turkey,
which is actively supporting
the jihadi forces in Syria.
Support is so strong that it appears
that Turkey helped its
allies in the Al-Nusra Front,
the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front
to kill and capture the few dozen fighters
that were introduced into
Syria by the Pentagon
a few weeks ago.
It's the result of several
years and who knows
how many billions of dollars of training.
And they did enter and were
immediately captured or killed
apparently with the aid
of Turkish intelligence.
Well, more important than
that is the central role
of the leading US ally, Saudi
Arabia for the jihadi rebels
in Syria and Iraq, and more
generally for Saudi Arabia
having been quoting a
major source of financing
to rebel and terrorist
organizations since the 1980s.
That's from a recent study
by the European Parliament,
repeating what's well-known.
And still more generally,
the missionary zeal
with which Saudi Arabia promulgates
its radical extremist
Wahhab-Salafi doctrines
by establishing Koranic schools, mosques,
sending radical clerics
throughout the Muslim world
with enormous impact.
One of the closest
observers of the region,
Patrick Coburn writes
that the Wahhabization
by Saudi Arabia, the Wahhabization
of mainstream Sunni Islam
is one of the most dangerous
developments of our era,
always with strong US support.
These are all things that
wouldn't do to mention
along with the fact that
these pernicious developments
are a direct outgrowth
of the long-term tendency
of the United States
picking up from Britain
before it to support radical Islam
in opposition to secular nationalism.
These are longstanding commitments.
Are there others like UN
ambassador, Samantha Power
who condemn Iran's
destabilization of the region.
Destabilization is an interesting concept
of political discourse, so for example,
when Iran comes to the aid
of the government of Iraq
and Iraqi Kurdistan in defense
against the assault of ISIS,
that's destabilization.
We have to prevent it, if
not aggression, perhaps.
In contrast, when the
United States invades Iraq,
it kills a couple hundred thousand people,
generates millions of
refugees, destroys the country,
sets off a sectarian
conflict that's tearing Iraq,
and by now the whole region to shreds,
and on the side increases
terrorism worldwide
by a factor of seven
just in the first year,
that's stabilization,
part of our imperial-era mission
that we must continue for
the benefit of the world.
Actually the exceptionalism
of US doctrinal institutions
is quite wonders to behold.
Well, going on with the
Washington Post editors,
they join Obama's negotiator,
Obama's Clinton negotiator,
Dennis Ross, Thomas
Friedman, other notables,
and calling on Washington
to provide Israel
with B-52 bombers and perhaps
even the more advanced
B2 bombers, and also
huge, what are called,
massive ordinance penetrators,
bunker busters informally.
There's a problem.
They don't have airstrips
for huge planes like that,
but they can use maybe Turkey's airstrips.
And none of this is for defense.
These are not defensive weapons.
Remember, all of these
weapons are offensive weapons
for Israel to use to bomb
Iran if it chooses to do so.
And since Israel's a US client,
it inherits from the master
the freedom from international law,
So nothing surprising about
giving it vast supplies
of offensive weapons
to use when it chooses.
Well, the violation of
in international law
goes well beyond threat, goes to action,
including acts of war, which
are proudly proclaimed,
presumably because that's our right
as an exceptional nation again.
One example is the successful sabotage
of Iranian nuclear
installations by cyber war.
That the Pentagon has
views about cyber war,
the Pentagon regards cyber
war as an active war,
which justifies a military response.
And a year ago, NATO
affirmed the same position,
determined that aggression
through cyber attacks
can trigger the collective
defense obligations
of the NATO alliance,
meaning if any country
is attacked by cyber war,
the whole alliance can
respond by military attacks.
That means cyber war attacks against us,
not by us against them.
And the significance of
these stands is again,
something that it wouldn't do to mention.
And you can check to see that
that condition is well-observed.
Well, perhaps the United
States and Israel are justified
in cowering in terror before Iran
because of its extraordinary
military power.
And it's possible to
evaluate that concern.
For example, you can turn to
the authoritative analysis,
detailed analysis
of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies,
the main source for such information,
last April which conducted
and published a long study
of the regional military balance.
And they find, I'll quote,
"a conclusive case that
the Arab Gulf states
have an overwhelming advantage over Iran
in both military spending
and access to modern arms".
It's the Gulf Cooperation Council states,
that's Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates,
they outspend Iran on
arms by a factor of eight.
It's an imbalance that goes back decades
and their report observes further
that the Arab Gulf states have
acquired and are acquiring
some of the most advanced and
effective weapons in the world
while Iran has been essentially
forced to live in the past
often relying on systems
originally delivered
at the time of the Shah 40 years ago,
which are essentially obsolete.
And the imbalance is of course
even greater with Israel,
which along with the
most advanced US weaponry
and its role as a virtual
offshore military base
of the global superpower
has a huge stock of nuclear weapons.
There are, of course, other threats
that justify serious concern
and can't be brushed aside.
A nuclear weapon state
might leak nuclear weapons
to jihadis, no joke.
In the case of Iran,
the threat is minuscule.
Not only are the Sunni jihadis,
the mortal elements of Iran,
but the ruling clerics,
whatever one thinks of them,
have shown no signs of clinical insanity.
And they know that if
there was even a hint
that they were the source
of a leaked weapon,
all they possess would
be instantly vaporized.
That doesn't mean that we can
ignore the threat, however,
not from Iran where it doesn't exist,
but from US ally, Pakistan,
where the threat is in fact very real.
It's discussed recently by two leading
Pakistani nuclear scientists,
Pervez Hoodbhoy, Zia Mian,
Britain's leading journal
of International Affairs.
They write that increasing
fears of militants
seizing nuclear weapons or materials
and unleashing nuclear terrorism,
have led to the creation
of a dedicated force of over 20,000 troops
to guard nuclear facilities.
There is no reason to assume, however,
that this force would be
immune to the problems
associated with the units guarding regular
military facilities, which
have frequently suffered attack
with insider help.
In other words, the whole system is laced
with jihadi elements in large measure
because of what Patrick Coburn described
the Wahhabization of Sunni
Islam from Saudi Arabia
and with the strong support
of the United States
ever since the Reagan administration.
Well, in short, the
problem is real enough,
very real in fact.
It's not being seriously addressed.
It's not even discussed.
Rather, what we're
concerned about is fantasies
concocted for other reasons
about the current official enemy.
Opponents of the Iran
nuclear deal maintain
that Iran is intent on
developing nuclear weapons.
Us intelligence can discern,
no evidence for this,
but there is no doubt at all
that in the past they have
in fact intended to do so
that we know this because
it was clearly stated
by the highest authorities in Iran.
The highest authority of
the Iranian state informed
foreign journalists that Iran
would develop nuclear weapons,
certainly, and sooner than one thinks.
The father of Iran's
nuclear energy program,
former head of Iran's
atomic energy organization
expressed his confidence
that the leadership's plan
is to build a nuclear bomb.
And a CIA report also had, in their words,
no doubt that Iran would
develop nuclear weapons
if neighboring countries
do, as of course they have.
All of this was under the Shah.
The highest authority just quoted
that is during the period
when high US officials,
Cheney, Rumsfeld, Kissinger
were urging the Shah
to proceed with nuclear programs.
And they were also pressuring universities
to accommodate these efforts.
My own university was an example.
MIT, under government
pressure, it made a deal
with the Shah to admit Iranian students
to the nuclear engineering department
in return for grants from the Shah.
This was done over the
very strong objections
of the student body, but
with comparably strong
faculty support.
That's a distinction
that raises a number of
interesting questions
about academic institutions
and how they function, the
faculty or the students
of a couple of years ago,
but have a different institutional place.
Opponents of the nuclear, in fact,
some of these MIT students are now running
the Iranian nuclear programs.
Opponents of the nuclear deal argue
that it didn't go far enough.
You've heard a lot of that.
And interestingly, some of the
supporters of the deal agree,
demanding that it go beyond
what has been achieved
and that the whole Middle
East should rid itself
of nuclear weapons, and in fact,
weapons of mass destruction, generally.
Actually, I'm quoting Iran's
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Jovan Zarif, he's reiterating the call
of the nonaligned movement.
Most of the world and the Arab states
for many years to establish a
"weapons-of-mass-destruction
free zone" in the Middle East.
Now that would be a
very straightforward way
to address whatever threat
Iran is alleged to pose,
but a lot more than that is at stake.
This is discussed recently in the leading
US world arms control journal,
arms control today by two leading figures
in the international
anti-nuclear, nuclear movement.
Two scientists who are veterans
of Pugwash and UN agencies,
they observed that the
successful adoption in 1995
of the resolution on the
establishment of a zone
free of weapons of mass
destruction in the Middle East
was the main element of a package
that permitted the extension
of the non-proliferation treaty.
That's the most important
arms control treaty there is.
And its continuation is
conditioned on acceptance of moves
towards establishing a
weapons-of-mass-destruction
free zone and nuclear-free
zone in the Middle East.
Repeatedly, implementation
of this plan has been blocked
by the United States at the
annual five-year review meetings
of the non-proliferation treaty,
most recently by Obama in 2010.
And again, in 2015, couple of months ago,
the same two anti-nuclear
specialists comment
that in 2015, this
effort was again blocked
by the United States on behalf of a state
that is not party to the
non-proliferation treaty
and is widely believed to be
the only one in the region
possessing nuclear weapons.
That's a polite and understated
reference to Israel.
Washington's sabotage of the possibility
in defense of Israeli nuclear weapons
may well undermine the
non-proliferation treaty
as well as maintaining
dangerous instability
in the Middle East, always of course,
in the name of stability.
This is incidentally not the only case
when opportunities to end
the alleged Iranian threat
have been undermined by Washington.
Some quite interesting cases, no time,
and I won't go into them,
but all of this raises
quite interesting questions,
which we should be asking about
what actually is at stake.
So turning to that, what
actually is the threat
posed by Iran?
Plainly, it's not a military
threat, it's obvious.
We can put aside the
fevered pronouncements
about Iranian aggression,
support for terror,
seeking hegemony over the region by force
or the still more outlandish notion
that even if Iran had
a bomb, it might use it
therefore suffering instant obliteration.
The real threat has been clearly explained
by US intelligence in
its reports to Congress
on the global security situation.
Of course they deal with
Iran, and they point out,
I'm quoting US intelligence,
"Iran's nuclear program and
its willingness to keep open
the possibility of
developing nuclear weapons
is a central part of
its deterrent strategy."
It's part of Iran's deterrent strategy,
no offensive policies,
but they are trying to
construct a deterrent.
And that Iran has a serious
interest in a deterrent strategy
is not in doubt among serious analysts.
It's recognized, for
example, by US intelligence.
So the influential analyst
and CIA veteran, Bruce Riddell
who's by no means a dove,
he writes that "if I was an
Iranian national security
planner, I would want nuclear
weapons as a deterrent.
And the reasons are pretty obvious."
He also makes another crucial comment.
He points out that Israel's
strategic room for maneuver
in the region would be constrained
by an Iranian nuclear deterrent.
And it's of course also
true of the United States.
Room for maneuver means resort
to aggression and violence.
And yes, it would be constrained
by an Iranian deterrent.
For the two rogue states that
rampage freely in the region,
the United States and Israel,
any deterrent is of course unacceptable.
And for those who are
accustomed and take for granted,
their right to rule by force,
that concern is easily
escalated to what's called
an existential threat.
The threat of deterrence is very severe
if you expect to resort to
force unilaterally at will
to achieve your goals
as the US and secondarily
Israel do commonly.
And more recently, the
second US ally, Saudi Arabia
has been trying to get into
the club pretty incompetently
with its invasion of Bahrain
to prevent mild reformist measures,
and the more recently, its
extensive bombing of Yemen,
which is causing a huge
humanitarian crisis.
So, for them a deterrent is a problem,
maybe even an existential threat.
That I think is the heart of the matter.
Even if it wouldn't do
to say, or to think,
and except for those who hope
to fend off possible disaster
and to move towards a more
peaceful and just world,
it's necessary to keep
to these injunctions.
These are things it wouldn't
do to say, wouldn't do to think
you don't read about them,
you don't hear about them,
but they are, I think,
the heart of the issue.
Thanks.

So how has the United States
supported radical Islam?
As I mentioned, just as
Britain did before it.
I won't comment on the British rule,
but if you wanna learn about it,
there's quite a good book on it
by a very good British diplomatic
historian, Mark Curtis,
who discusses in detail
going back to the documentary record,
how Britain supported radical Islam
during its period of dominance.
The US has done it always.
The major center of radical
Islam, extremist radical Islam
is Saudi Arabia unquestionably.
They're the source of the
Wahhbization of the region,
which Patrick Coburn points out as one of
the major developments of the modern era.
Who's the main supporter of Saudi Arabia?
You are.
Now that's where your tax
dollars go and for a long time.
Right now, tens of billions of dollars
of arms being sent under
Obama, but it goes way back.
In fact, the strong US
relation with Israel
developed out of this.
The United States and
Israel had close relations,
but not unusual through
the 1950s and early '60s.
That changed in 1967.
What happened in 1967?
Israel performed a huge
service to the United States
and its Saudi Arabian ally.
Saudi Arabia has been
and remains the center
of extremist radical fundamentalist Islam
with offshoots and the
jihadi movements and so on,
including ISIS.
At the time, the center
of secular nationalism
was Naser's Egypt and there was a conflict
between the two of them.
In fact, they were at war
in the Yemen at the time,
Israel administered a very serious blow
to secular nationalism.
It devastated the Egyptian army and Syria,
and it saved Saudi Arabia
and offered a great boon
to the United States.
And in fact, if you check
back it's at that time,
that the unusual, in
fact, unique relationship
between Israel and the
United States developed.
And in fact, it continues after that.
I could give more examples
if there was time,
but that has been a consistent pattern.
There are few exceptions here and there.
So sometimes the United
States has supported
secular Islamic states.
The most extreme and interesting
example is Saddam Hussein
who was greatly loved by
the Reagan administration,
and by the Bush one administration.
I could give you the details of,
they were so supportive of Saddam Hussein
that he was even given a gift
that otherwise only
Israel has been granted,
no other country.
He was permitted to
attack a US naval vessel,
killing a couple of dozen American sailors
and to get away with it with
just a tap on the wrist,
Israel had done the same thing in 1967.
Saddam Hussein did it in 1987.
And his friendship for Saddam
Hussein was so enormous
that he was granted that right.
And that was a secular state.
In fact, George Bush number
one, even invited Iraqi
nuclear engineers to the United
States for advanced training
in nuclear weapons production.
That's pretty, pretty
supportive relationship.
So there are cases where the
United States has supported
secular Islam, but
typically it's radical Islam
that has been the
beneficiary of US support,
like Britain before.
- This one comes live stream.
And it's connected to that one.
And let's mention that it
came from the live stream.
- Should I answer this too?
- No, just do that.
- Why isn't the United States doing more
to help Syrian refugees?
That's a question you
should ask yourselves.
Why aren't we doing more?
(audience applauding)
After all, we're pretty
munificent already.
I think 2000 have been
accepted after several years.
Wait, but yes, that's a
very serious question.
Can be generalized,
there are other refugees.
What about people fleeing from Honduras?
(audience applauding)
That's the main source of what's called
the refugee crisis here.
Most of them are coming from Honduras.
Why?
Something happened in Honduras
a couple of years ago.
There was a military coup which overthrew
the democratic government.
Support with the United States,
was about the only country
that gave its support.
And the result of the military
coup is a real horror story.
It was bad enough before,
but it's become horrendous.
And so people are fleeing and
therefore we have to build
a mile-high wall on the Texas
border or whatever it is.
So yeah, these are fair questions.
The Obama doctrine vis-a-vis Syria.
It's a good question.
(audience laughing)
Washington hasn't a clue.
It's obvious and it's a little
hard to fault them for that.
It's very hard to think
of a constructive outcome
to this utter disaster.
The United States has taken a
somewhat hands-off position,
except that it's supporting its allies
who are very clear, as I mentioned,
Turkey, NATO ally, has been
supporting the Al-Qaeda-related
jihadi fronts, mainly the Al-Nusra front,
a couple of others.
The Gulf states, also
US allies, Saudi Arabia,
where they have been strong supporters
of what's now become the Islamic state.
Technically, Saudi Arabia, the
government no longer claims,
no longer support them directly,
but surely did in the past.
And funders from the wealthy
Gulf states are still
presumably funding them
as they have in the past.
That's pretty open in the case of Qatar.
So these are indirect US policies.
The only conceivable
hope for some resolution
of this horrendous crisis,
which is totally destroying the country,
is the kind of negotiated settlement
that was worked on by serious negotiators
like Laktel Rahimi, an
international negotiator,
very respectable, sensible.
And the main idea which
shared by any analyst
with a gray cell functioning
is some kind of negotiated settlement,
which will involve the Assad
government, like it or not,
and involve the opposition
elements, like it or not.
There can't be negotiations
that don't involve the parties
that are fighting.
That's pretty obvious,
just as South African
negotiations had to involve
the leadership of the
Apartheid state, no other way.
It can't have other negotiations.
It's perfectly obvious
that the Assad government
is not going to enter into negotiations
that are based on the condition
that it commits suicide.
If that's the condition,
they're just gonna keep
destroying the country.
That unfortunately has
been the US position.
The negotiations US and
allies have demanded
that negotiations be
based on the precondition
that the Assad government
will not survive.
It's a horrible government.
I'd like it not to survive,
but that's a prescription
for destroying Syria
because it's not going to
enter into negotiations
on those terms.
Right now and in fact in the
past, these have been proposals
pretty much supported by the Russians.
And in fact, you may not have seen this,
but for those of you who
read the international press,
British press a couple of days ago,
there was a very interesting revelation
that in 2012, the Russians
had apparently presented
a proposal for an interim regime,
which would not include Assad.
And it was turned down by the
United States and the West.
That was reported in practically
the entire British press,
Guardian, Independent, Daily
Telegraph, across the spectrum,
didn't appear in the
United States for a while.
But finally it did appear not
in print as far as I can tell,
but in an online edition
of the Washington Post,
where there's an article of the usual type
that sort of mentions
that this is rumored,
but can't take it seriously, and so on,
probably didn't mean it
and so on and so forth.
Well, okay, you can draw
your own conclusions,
but as far if you ask what
the Obama doctrine is,
it doesn't exist.
We saw the Obama doctrine
a couple of weeks ago
when the Pentagon sent
in these 50 fighters
who had been trained for years
and they were immediately
captured, killed,
or just affected by Turkey's
ally, the Al-Nusra front,
as I mentioned,
apparently with Turkish
intelligence support.
That's the doctrine, nothing,
except support the allies,
which are in fact
supporting jihadi forces.
But what the doctrine ought to be,
I think, is pretty clear.
What the chances are for
settlement in those terms
is hard to say and not very high,
but if you can think of an alternative,
you should present it.
No other alternative has been proposed.
What do you think about
the addicts of Donald Trump
in tangent to your earlier idea
about American exceptionalism?
(audience laughing)
Well, action.
(audience applauding)
I think we should recognize
that the other candidates
are not that different.
I mean, if you take a look.
(audience applauding)
I mean, just take a look at their views.
They've tell you their views,
and they're astonishing.
So just to keep to Iran
a couple of weeks ago,
the two front runners,
they're not the front runners
any longer, where Jeb
Bush and Scott Walker
and they differed on Iran.
Walker said, "we have to bomb Iran".
When he gets elected, they're
gonna bomb Iran immediately
the day he's elected.
Bush was little, he is more serious.
He said he's gonna wait till
the first cabinet meeting.
(audience laughing)
And then they'll bomb Iran.
I mean, this is just off the spectrum
of not only international
opinion, but even relative sanity.
(audience laughing)
This is, I think Orange
Donald and men are correct.
It's a radical insurgency.
It's not a political party.
You can tell that even by the votes.
I mean, any issue of any complexity
is gonna have some diversity of opinion,
but when you get a unanimous
vote to kill the Iranian deal
or the Affordable Care Act or
whatever the next thing may be
you know you're not dealing
with a political party.
It's an interesting
question why that's true.
I think what's actually happened is that
during the whole, what's it
called, neo-liberal period,
last generation, both
political parties have drifted
to the right.
Today's Democrats are
what used to be called
"moderate Republicans".
The Republicans have just
drifted off the spectrum.
They're so committed to
extreme wealth and power
that they can't get votes by
presenting those positions.
So what has happened is
that they've mobilized
sectors of the population
that have been around
for a long time.
It is a pretty exceptional
country in many ways.
One is, it's extremely religious.
It's one of the most extreme
fundamentalist countries
in the world.
And by now I suspect
the majority of the base
of the Republican Party
is Evangelical Christians,
extremists, not they're a mixture,
but these are the extremist ones.
Nativists who are afraid
that they are taking
our White Anglo-Saxon
country away from us.
People who have to have guns
when they go into Starbucks
because, who knows, they might be killed
by an Islamic terrorists and so on.
I mean, all of that is part of the country
and it goes back to colonial
days, their real roots to it,
but these have not been an
organized political force
in the past as they are now.
That's the base of the Republican Party
and you see it in the primary.
So yeah, Trump is, maybe comic relief,
but it's not that different
from the mainstream,
which I think is more important.
US exceptionalism has existed since the,
what's that?
- Doctrine,
- Since the doctrine of
Manifest Destiny in the 18th,
actually 19th century, what has changed?
Well, what's changed is the capacity
to implement the doctrines.
So it takes the Monroe doctrine, 1823.
The Monroe doctrine essentially declared
that the United States
must rule the hemisphere.
It didn't say it in those words,
but that's what it amounted to.
And it was the intellectual
father of the Monroe doctrine.
It was John Quincy Adams,
who was also the intellectual
author of Manifest Destiny.
Well, there was a problem.
This is the 1820s.
There was deterrent.
The deterrent was Britain,
Britain was the hated enemy.
They were the big military power
and they prevented the United States
from achieving its first
foreign policy goal.
By foreign, I mean outside
the national territory,
that's also aggression, but
it's not called aggression,
but conquest of the national territory,
what's now the national
territory, of course,
was a war against the
indigenous population
who were exterminated and expelled.
But you know the first
so-called foreign goal
was to take over Cuba,
goes back to the 1820s,
couldn't do it, British
Navy was in the way.
John Quincy Adams, who was
an astute grand strategist,
pointed out to his colleagues
that we just have to wait.
He said sooner or later,
US power will increase,
British power will decline.
And as he put it, the Cuba
will fall into our hands
by the laws of political gravitation,
just the way an apple falls from the tree,
which indeed happened
over the 19th century.
Us power increased,
British power declined.
The US was able to take further steps
in the Western hemisphere,
and in 1898, in fact,
it was able to conquer Cuba.
That's if you go to school
in the United States,
you learn that the United
States liberated Cuba in 1898.
In fact, the US invaded to prevent Cuba
from liberating itself from
Spain, which is what happened.
And since after that, it
just became a virtual colony
until liberation and finally in 1959.
And ever since then, the
United States has been trying
to reverse it, and the
same is true generally.
The United States did
not, it may have been,
it's probably the richest
country in the world
back in the early 19th century,
but not the most powerful country.
Britain was the most powerful.
France was a powerful country.
And that changed over the years,
especially with the First World War,
finally with the Second World War.
So exceptionalism has greatly
expanded as power expanded.
And I say again that this
exceptionalism was also true
of other great powers during their day
of imperial power and domination.
World leaders will meet
in New York City next week
for a new set of global
anti-poverty targets,
sustainable development goals.
Do you think these targets are sufficient?
As an easy answer, two letters.
(audience laughing)
And furthermore, nothing will be achieved.
It's pretty safe to say.
(audience laughing)
(audience applauding)
Can you comment on the
importance of WikiLeaks cables?
They've been really revealing.
You learn a lot from them.
And some of them are really interesting,
including ones that aren't discussed much.
I mean, most of them you've
seen, but for example,
one of the WikiLeaks,
one interesting question
that should be in everybody's mind is
what is the basis for the
extraordinary relationship
between the United States and Israel?
There are a lot of reasons for it,
but one interesting aspect was revealed
by a WikiLeaks cable, which
I think wasn't reported.
One of the cables listed,
the leaks listed a documented
an internal US document,
Pentagon document,
which listed the top strategic priorities
in the United States, regions in the world
that were so important
that we had to protect them
at all costs.
There were maybe, I forget
how many, dozen or so.
One of them was right outside Haifa,
Rafael Military Industries,
major military industry.
That's one of the main places
where drone technology's been developed.
The links between US and Israeli high-tech
military industry are extremely close.
In fact, in this case,
Rafael, the biggest industry,
the ties are so close
that Rafael actually moved
its management headquarters to Washington
where the money is.
Well, what that tells you?
That gives an interesting
insight into the nature
of the relationship.
Israel now does play a major role,
small country, but good
high-tech industry.
And it plays a major role in
repression and aggression.
It's developed the Israeli arms fairs,
where they sell their arms.
They advertise correctly
that the they have developed
advanced means of repression and control,
and that the arms that they're displaying
are battlefield-tested, namely
against the Palestinians.
So they've refined the
techniques of control
and they contribute to
that all over the place,
Central America, even
in the United States.
They're providing advice
on how to bar Honduran immigrants
from coming to the United States.
They help train police,
and so on, many examples.
Well, that's only one case,
but there have been many other cases
of the WikiLeaks materials.
It's really worth reading through them,
not just the ones that do get reported,
but many other ones.
There's actually a
volume that just came out
on Wikileaks, which is important reading.
Oh, do you think that UN foreign policies,
US foreign policy, sorry,
is driven exclusively
by economic interests?
What other factors
influence US foreign policy
and to what extent?
That's quite an interesting question.
It's certainly not driven
entirely by economic interests.
In fact, there are very striking cases.
Usually, by and large,
the US foreign policy
like other major states,
is driven by the dominant domestic forces.
That's kind of natural.
And the dominant domestic
forces are of course
the corporate sector,
that's not in question,
so by and large, foreign policy
is driven by their interests
and what the Clinton
doctrine, which I quoted,
"is an obvious case", but
there are plenty of others.
However, there are exceptions
and they're very interesting ones.
Actually Iran is an exception,
quite an interesting one.
And that goes back to the
first US serious involvement
with Iran.
Iran was a kind of a
British virtual colony.
The British were involved
in preventing Iran
from developing, getting either
economically or politically.
But that changed in 1953,
when Britain was too weak
to overthrow the parliamentary regime
and the US took over and carried out,
basically carried out the coup
that installed the Shah.
Something quite interesting
happened at that time.
The United States government
wanted US energy corporations
to take over 40% of
the British concession.
It was, the British were
taking Iranian and oil,
but the Eisenhower administration wanted
US energy corporations to take 40% of it.
Well, that's an economic interest.
They didn't want to, they
didn't want to for good reasons.
It was much cheaper then to
get oil from Saudi Arabia.
So that just for straight
business reasons,
they didn't want to have to go to Iran.
And furthermore, they were concerned that
that might harm their relations
with the Saudi dictators
Saudi family that essentially
owns and runs the country.
And they didn't want to bother with that.
The US government actually forced them,
forced the oil companies
to take a 40% concession.
The Eisenhower administration
threatened them
with antitrust suits and other
threats if they didn't do it.
So of course they backed down and did it.
That's pretty unusual, and I
think it's happening now too.
We don't have documents
from the present period.
You get documents from earlier periods,
but you can be pretty confident
that the US energy
corporations would be delighted
to break into the Iranian market.
They don't like the idea.
Every other, just about
every other major country
is sending business delegations,
investors and others
to try to profit from the opening of Iran,
which they support, and
the US energy corporations
and other US businesses
are blocked by state power.
And you can be sure
that they don't like it.
If we had access to their
internal deliberations.
I'm sure it would say that.
Well, that's a case where
state power, in this case,
overwhelms even economic interests.
Iran has to be punished.
Iran committed a serious crime.
They disobeyed orders, and
you don't disobey orders.
One of the major doctrines
of international affairs,
which doesn't appear in the literature
is the mafia doctrine.
International affairs are
run very much like the mafia.
The godfather does not
tolerate disobedience.
It's much due dangers.
So if some small storekeeper somewhere say
doesn't pay protection money.
The don doesn't accept it.
You send their goons
to beat them to a pulp
even if you don't need the money,
because others might get the idea
and things might start to erode.
That is a dominant principle
of international affairs.
In fact, that was the
reason for the 1953 coup
when you look back.
And it's also the reason
for US hostility to Iran,
which is extreme.
I mentioned the support for Saddam Hussein
that was an attack on
Iran and a serious one,
but they defied orders.
They overthrew a US-imposed tyrant.
They thumbed their nose
at the United States
and you don't get away with that.
Actually, Cuba is very similar,
since Cuba is extremely,
the hostility to Cuba
is quite interesting.
I mean for decades, ever
since polls were taken,
the majority, the US population has been
in favor of normalization of relations.
Okay, it's normal to
disregard the population
in a democracy, they don't count.
But what is unusual in this case is that
major sectors of US
economic power have been
in favor of normalization.
Big sectors, pharmaceuticals,
energy industries,
agribusiness, they've
all wanted to get into
the Cuban market and the
state has blocked it,
which is quite unusual.
And there's another case where
state power has overwhelmed
even the power of its
major domestic sources.
In fact, these are two
quite striking examples
and it's the same thing.
And in the case of Cuba, we know it.
If you go back to the
Kennedy administration,
when the war against Cuba really took off,
it was very explicit.
The State Department
said we can't tolerate
what they called "successful
defiance of US policies"
that go back to the Monroe doctrine.
Arthur Schlesinger, Kennedy's
Latin American advisor
reported to him.
The report of his Latin
American mission said
the problem is the Castro
idea of taking matters
into your own hands,
which appeals to others
in the hemisphere where people
suffer similar repression
and you can't let that idea spread.
It's the mafia doctrine
again, powerful enough
to sharply conflict
with economic interests.
So there are cases, but they're rare
and they're illuminating.
- I think this is gonna
have to be the last one.
We've got all of these,
but time's running out.
- What is intelligence?
(audience laughing)
Well, it's something that's
lacking in certain places.
(audience laughing)
Let's put it like that.
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)
