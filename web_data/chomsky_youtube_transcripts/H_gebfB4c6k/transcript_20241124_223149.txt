same in the election campaign scarcely a
word about the issue that's merely the
most crucial one in all of human history
actually hardly a day passes without
more information about the severity and
imminence of the threat so a couple of
days after the New York Times article
study appeared in nature showing that
retention of heat in the oceans has been
greatly underestimated which means that
the total carbon budget the amount of
carbon we can use with that total
disaster
is much less than was assumed in the
already ominous IPCC report study
calculates that maximum emissions would
have to be reduced by 25% to avoid
warming of 2 degrees centigrade which is
well above the danger point at the same
time polls show that half of Republicans
deny that global warming is even taking
place and of the rest
almost half reject any human
responsibility and no doubt they are
influenced by their leaders who they
trust more than the media it's a major
achievement of today's Republican Party
which as I said before is the most
dangerous organization in human history
I concede that that's an outrageous
statement which regrettably happens to
be true it's hard to describe to find
words to describe what's happening
before I rise and the same is true of
the second existential threat nuclear
war a few weeks before the election was
you know Trump announced that the u.s.
was Lizabeth blowing from the INF treaty
the treaty yeah Reagan or Gorbachev
eliminated short-range missiles deployed
in Western Europe and Russia missiles
that are extremely hazardous because
they have only a few minutes flight time
to Moscow that poses a decapitation
threat threat of destroying and
incapacity retaliated of course that
sharply increases the danger of a
massive nuclear response response but
two warnings given by automated systems
that have often failed in the past that
would anyone familiar with the record
knows that it's a virtual miracle that
we've so far avoided nuclear war and
miracles you can't count on going on now
the threat that was already grave was
heightened by the Trump Nuclear Posture
review authorize new destabilizing
weapons and it lowered the threshold for
nuclear attack and this latest move was
20 INF treaty increases the threat
further again scarcely a mention on the
campaign trail or in coverage the u.s.
is withdrawing from the treaty on the
grounds that China's not a partner and
that the Russians have violated the
Russians in turn claimed that the u.s.
has violated it's quite obvious how to
address these problems through
inspections and diplomacy neither of
which have been attempted rather let's
just wisely increase the threat of total
destruction and let's ignore all of this
and the vast outpourings during the
political campaign well let's put aside
the most significant questions in human
history and return to what is considered
within the realm of discourse
the election once again demonstrated the
failures of the Democratic Party to deal
with issues that matter to working
people even more than before
the Democrats lost the one
college-educated white population on the
surface it seems that this can be
attributed to the success of Trump's
racist the xenophobic to feel appeals
there was success which was tell us
something about the society as you may
recall a Trump was pulling a leaf from
Ronald Reagan's playbook the back in
1985 our brave cowboy leader strapped on
his boots declared a national emergency
because Nicaraguan forces were only two
days march from Arlington Texas and
people didn't collapse in Landsberg and
it's the same when Trump warns that if
some of the women and children cleaing
it from misery and oppression actually
reach our borders they'll all try to
kill us the Miller misery and oppression
for which we happened to be largely
responsible but put that aside so it's
necessary for heavily armed militias to
travel to the border to back up the
15,000 troops and sent there to defend
us and amazingly it seems to have worked
surveys report that people did for Trump
because he's the only one who can save
us from destruction by these criminals
hordes that does carry lessons and when
we ask why it works I think we find
something deeper something which is
pretty much worldwide particularity
'he's from place to place
but some fundamental similarities so
keep to the United States in the US
working-class people have suffered 40
years of stagnation while wealth
concentrates in very few hands
but the Democrats have not ignored all
this worse than that they've carried
forward the neoliberal policies that
took off with Strega and Thatcher and
have imposed these consequences by
design from the perspective of the
designers the neoliberal programs have
been a brilliant success inequality has
reached staggering levels sure Revolver
the numbers top 1.1 percent of the
population now have as much wealth as
the bottom 50% a great many of whom
that's practically zero wolf rules of
corporate governance were changed in
ways that allowed executive compensation
to soar by a thousand percent since 1978
meanwhile real wages for non-supervisory
workers have actually declined and it
continues under Trump despite low
unemployment wage growth which did rise
a little in 2014 and 15 is now declining
it is no no longer even keeping up with
inflation which means real wages are
stagnant or declining during the period
of extremely low unemployment unions
have been subjected the bitter attack by
a combined offensive by the state and
private capital with the help of the
most reactionary Supreme Court and
living memory while getting worse
financial institutions have exploded in
scale they have also changed radically
from service to the real economy as was
the case during the great growth period
of the 50s and the 60s to no speck
elation and risk with enormous profit
they've reached 40% of corporate profits
before the crash ten years ago the crash
which they were largely responsible
deregulation Reagan and Clinton and
young at the right at once it led to
financial crises there had not been any
before under New Deal regulation but
each one is more severe than the last
but that's no problem for the
perpetrators there are very handsomely
supported by the taxpayer not just by
the highly publicized bailouts but also
by more subtle and significant names
such as access to cheap credit and
inflated credit ratings the thanks to
the passage of government insurance
policy that's actually the source of
most of the wealth for the Greek banks
from the crashes the financial
institutions emerge Richards more
powerful than before well the victims
suffered and a side effect of great
significance is the country's wealth is
being shifted from research and
development innovation the financial
transactions in the interest of the very
rich just fine for the super rich but
disastrous for the health and the future
of the society socioeconomic
achievements have been accompanied by
doctrinal ones and to see how far a lead
ideology that's shifted to the right
during the neoliberal use useful to look
back to what is considered conservatism
two years earlier the views of President
Eisenhower for example so here's
Eisenhower I have no use for those we go
of their political party to hold some
foolish dream of spinning the clock back
today's when unorganized labor was a
huddled almost helpless mass only a
handful of unreconstructed reactionaries
barber the ugly thought of breaking
unions only a fool would try to deprive
working men and women of the right to
join the union of their choice should
any political party attempt to abolish
Social Security unemployment insurance
to eliminate labor laws and farm
programs you would not hear of that
party again in our political history
there is a tiny splinter of course that
believes you can do these things among
them are a few Texas oil millionaires
and an occasional politician or
businessman from other areas their
number is negligible and they are stupid
that's conservatism vintage 1950s well
they may have been negligible in total
numbers but they were very far from
stupid they have friends under Reagan
Thatcher Clinton they've now basically
taken over both political parties
Republicans to an extreme extent and a
good deal will be intellectual focus
it's kind of interesting that today
Bernie Sanders is considered a radical
revolutionary far off the political
spectrum for voicing relief pretty
similar to door guys in homes tells us a
lot about what's happened in the past
couple of generations the achievements
of the neoliberal economy greatly
impressed a lead opinion that included
the economics profession which held what
they called the Great Moderation
they consonant ly ensured the public of
recessions were a thing of the past
now the sophisticated market theories
were able to keep inflation under
control and ensure the steady growth to
be sure for very small percentage of the
population the master Saint Alain
considered one of the great economists
of the ages that was before the old
structures that he supervised collapsed
and shambles that would have become
worse than the Great Depression
it's thought I've had it not been for
drastic actions to somehow risky the
economy well while he was still basking
in glory Saint Allen instructed Congress
on the reasons for his success and
managing the flourishing economy his
success explained relied on what he
called growing worker insecurity as he
explained workers were so intimidated
that even when unemployment was very low
they were simply afraid to ask for
better wages and benefits and that's
very good because it means that there's
no inflationary pressure and that we
didn't bother to mention is it means
that profits can soar sky-high again
what's happening today
well that was during the boom of the 90s
which led to bust well nothing like the
crash ten years ago which was caused by
predatory lending for homes complex
financial instruments to obscure the
cheer robbery all thanks to the
regulation
a lot of experience with exhibited with
conferences in third-world countries
they sometimes break down also in the
United States some blessings there -
well the going back to the boom of the
90s when Saint Allen was explaining
about the wonders of Greater worth or
insecurity that they do bus nothing like
the last one after the crash Congress
passed legislation legislation would had
two parts first part was to bail out the
perpetrators ended up richer than before
and the second part was to help the
victims of the homeowners who were
devastated by the predatory behavior of
the banks and financial institutions
well anyone who understands the logic of
modern capitalism could easily have
predicted which of the two prongs was
executed it was a giveaway to Wall
Street executives the second special and
sector Inspector General of the bailout
program neil parofsky
argued complaining bitterly about the
failure of the obama administration to
pursue the back half of the legislation
of course in vain well the general
public may not know the details but
nevertheless they can readily express
what's happening easy prey tends to be
their defender against the hated elites
well in fact he's stabbing him in the
back at their return prime example is
the most prized achievement of the
trumpet ministry
the tax bill that monoliths joseph
stiglitz described as the us donor
Relief Act of 2017 with a bill lavishes
gifts on the very wealthy corporate
sector and brings an extra benefit it
created a huge deficit on purpose of
course the purpose was cheerfully
explained right away by Paul Ryan Mitch
McConnell the architects of the program
as they pointed out we now have this
terrible deficit and in order to deal
with it it's necessary to reduce the
already meager social spending for the
general population health education food
support for the poor other irrelevant
ruling worker insecurity that Saint
Allen lauded as the basis for a healthy
economy that's been enhanced by the way
employment has been changed during the
neoliberal period increasingly the
economy is designed to create a folk
Arius existence what's sometimes called
the new precariat of the mass of the
victims are sometimes called as a recent
study by two prominent labor economists
Princeton Lauren Lawrence Katz Alan
Krueger they found them quoting them
that 94% of the net employment growth in
the US economy from 2005 to 2015
appears to have occurred in alternative
work arrangements 94 percent the
part-time temporary irregular the few
employer commitments individual
arrangements well people who were cast
aside by
social and economic policies and see a
bleak future quite naturally feel
resentment anger fear when it's all too
easy for these feelings to be directed
to scapegoats the commonly those who are
even more vulnerable that's particularly
true from unpopulated that have been
atomized by policies that are aimed at
undermining the social order guided by
Margaret Thatcher's a famous maxim that
there is no society only individuals
that was catchers unwitting paraphrase
of Karl Marx who bitterly condemned the
authoritarian rulers of Europe in the
mid 19th century for seeking to turn
society into what he called a sack of
potatoes an amorphous mass of isolated
people who confront concentrated power
alone concentration of wealth and power
automatically translate to decline of
democracy the means are too familiar to
review extensive research has shown that
by now a large majority of voters are
literally disenfranchised and that their
own representatives pay no attention to
their wishes but listen to other voices
the voices of the donor class top tiny
percent though furthermore well
established that elections are pretty
much brought electability and hence
policy is predictable with remarkable
precision by the single variable of
campaign spending that works both for
the executive and for Congress
Tom Ferguson's work is particularly
revealing it goes back into the 19th
century it includes the 2016
and that's a bear beginning during the
neoliberal period the number of
lobbyists has just exploded legislation
is commonly shaped even sometimes
actually written by corporate lobbyists
while the representatives who sign it
have their eyes on funding for the next
election as both parties shifted to the
right in the neoliberal years the
Democrats as I mentioned of a band of
the working class and the Republicans
have just arrested off the spectrum and
the leadership understands that they
understand that they cannot get votes on
their actual policies so what they've
done over the years is to try to
mobilize a voting constituency on other
grounds what are sometimes called
cultural grounds keeping away from the
crucial socio economic policy very
revealing case of this one of many is
the matter of abortion rights if you go
back to the 1960s the Republican Party
was strongly pro-choice Reagan Ford
George HW Bush in 1972 two-thirds of
Republicans believe that abortion is a
private matter
the government should have no
involvement well Nixon and his cohorts
realized along with their famous
southern strategy but they could attract
the Catholic vote which had usually been
democratic simply by adopting a strong
anti-abortion flank couple years later
evangelicals that began to be organized
for political action
the Republican operative Paul Wyrick now
he recognized
opportunity the among the demands of the
newly organized evangelicals was demands
for segregated schools if I realized
that you can't call for that but he had
another proposal namely the Republican
Party should pretend to oppose abort
abortion and if it did it could pick up
the evangelical vote that's now a core
part of Trump's voting base and the
leadership accordingly shifted to
passionate pro-life advocates Reagan or
Ford all the rest that included those
who sometimes believed but to have some
character and honesty like George Bush
the first well mean well of course the
actual Republican constituency remains
as it has been a great wealth of the
power even more brazenly so long from
and it's quite an impressive achievement
to serve the actual constituency with
dedication while somehow maintaining
hold on the voting constituency a voting
constituency but is shrinking the
leadership understands that they're
becoming more and more a minority party
which is of course why they're so
dedicated to find Moses moto repress
groups oppression and packing the courts
with reactionaries who will support
their references of the Roberts Court
has so far done the election highlighted
related an ominous development so the
Republicans increased their Senate
Majority how with 42 percent of the
votes against 57 percent for the losing
Democrats
right now sixty senators are elected by
25% of the population that's rural white
religious heavily-armed and the tendency
is increasing it's hard to see how some
form of civil conflict can be avoided if
this continues unless the democrats
reverse of course sharply and become a
political party that doesn't simply
abandon the working class as they've
done for 40 years looking briefly
elsewhere very briefly there are similar
developments in Europe combination of
neoliberal policies called austerity in
Europe and flaws and EU governance which
place power and Brussels away from the
national communities of these exacerbate
the problems so the resentment against
formal democratic institutions shows up
in election after election and it should
come as little surprise under these
circumstances there's some local
differences but quite similar factors
are involved in the catastrophic
election and fazil a few weeks ago
enormous consequences one of them of
worldwide significance is that one of
the policies of the new literally
neo-fascist leader is to open up the
Amazon to exploitation by agribusiness
and - mining which could be a virtual
death knell for the species species
that's one of the main sources of carbon
sequestration well despite all of this
there are quite a few bright spots that
relieve the general malaise
all over the world lively energetic
popular movements are rising they
working hard for a sharp reversal of the
dismal course of the past generation and
the USC Sanders movement grows radically
from over a century of US political
history that's the most significant
aspect of the 2016 election and the
offshoots of the movement are hard at
work along with others with considerable
impact seems true with Corbin in England
of amlo and Mexico Michels throughout
the world the achievements of the recent
past provide their own powerful lessons
about what can be achieved and
inspirations to commit ourselves to it
one should never underestimate the
obstacles that are lie ahead nor the
capacity of the human spirit to overcome
one to prevail
you
can you hear me
barely hold on a second
Valeri is trying to get the my wife for
those of you don't know to get the sound
of also money techie can you hear me now
oh yeah that's better
okay well there's a whole bunch of
questions I've tried to condense them
this is two or three questions in one
what accounts for the rise in hate
crimes and intolerance are we seeing the
onset of fascism there is a rise in hate
crimes that's well documented we can't
blame it all on trunk in fact I think
there's a deeper reason the
circumstances that allow the character
like Trump to appear with dog whistles
and hints to incite hatred violence to
term the very natural resentment and
fears in pathological directions but the
fundamental reason and it's not just in
the United States worldwide almost is
the impact of the socio-economic
policies that have been instituted
almost worldwide and the past 40 years
differences in different places and
variation but they're pretty much the
same so-called neoliberal policies
oriented to benefiting the business
world the will the extreme wealthy the
corporate sector and essentially casts
the mass of the population that creates
conditions under which somebody like
Trump cut inflame latent fears and
concerns and simply stimulate the kind
of hate crimes that we're seeing is it
fascism no fascism is a serious thing
set of socio-economic policies in which
a powerful state organized and
controlled the society serves big
business but controlled it was not
controlled by it as in today's economy
and led to excesses which are too
horrible and well-known to bother
describing I have to say that given my
age I can recall the 1930s I can recall
the fear from a child's perspective of
the rise of the fascist plague over
Europe it seemed unstoppable I can
remember listening over the radio to
Hitler's Nuremberg rallies could
understand the words but there was no
mistaking the nature of the crowds and
when I hear Trump's rallies today
sometimes so the disgraceful hardly
works to describe them like ridiculing
the woman who was the victim of sexual
assault and listen to the crowd roaring
does bring back memories I think there
are things to worry about
a serious attention to what it's not yet
neo-fascism here's another question
ya hear me can you hear me no okay
sounds like an early kgn you broadcast
doing doing interviews are you there can
you hear me
how has US policy contributed to the
crisis refugee crisis in Central America
very straightforwardly US policy in
Central America has been harsh and
brutal back to the late 19th century but
in the 1980s very sharply escalated the
Reagan carried out a series of vicious
terrorist wars in Salvador Guatemala a
base in Honduras which became a base for
also heavy repression and torture
there was one country that suffered
severely from the Reaganite wars
Nicaragua but it's the one country that
had an army to protect it so it wasn't
quite as bad as in the others and the
others the army were the state
terrorists the Fester this was hundreds
of thousands of people killed many
hundred thousand tortured widows orphans
countries devastated
there were truth Commission's which
attributed the overwhelming majority of
the atrocities to the state terrorist
suspect and supported by the United
States in Guatemala many ways the worst
in the early 80s there was literal
genocide against the Mayan population by
the dictator Rios Montt that one of
Reagan's favorite feet called him a man
dedicated to totally dedicated to
democracy who's getting a bum rap from
the human rights organizations as if
this wasn't bad enough the policies
continued afterwards
during the war the huge numbers of
people fled to the United States many
young people Salvadorans and Los Angeles
and other places a lot of young people
fell into the depressed oppressed areas
of the United States the slums of Los
Angeles join drug gangs and made their
own drug gangs then they were reported
reported back where they're terrorizing
their society then take a look at the
country that's providing the plurality
the refugees Honduras Y 2009 that was a
reformist mildly reformist president in
Honduras Malaya
it was kicked out by a military coup
this was condemned all through Latin
America by most of the world with one
exception the Obama administration
refused to call it a military coup
because if they did they would have had
to stop funding the military hunt about
US law it was an election fraud
collection run under the military regime
again condemned by almost all countries
praised by the Obama administration as
an important step towards democracy and
it gets worse
Honduras became one of the may be the
murder capital of the world and now it's
sending most of the refugees so that's
the background if we were had a minimum
level of civilization we would not only
be treating the refugees humanely but
working hard to try to rebuild what
we've destroyed they don't want to flee
their countries they didn't much rather
be there if it was possible that's where
the main direction of our activities
should be I should say to mitigate these
criticisms in Europe it's just as bad or
maybe worse Europe has a certain history
in Africa which we need not review and
when people are flee
from the wreckage of Africa including
the recent wreckage of the Libyan war
but far broader and deeper what happens
that thousands of them drown in the
Mediterranean that Europeans fund Turkey
to accept millions of refugees keep them
away from Europe's borders Italy turns
them back
Italy incidentally which opened the
nineteenth century with the first major
genocide in Libya but now you turn them
back when they're fleeing and it didn't
end in the 19th century this is a
problem in the crisis of Western society
which is just shattering to think about
particularly when you recognize that
there are countries that are reaching a
sort of civilized level so in Lebanon
poor Lebanon that 40% of the population
of refugees salmon Jordan salmon Kenya
the biggest refugee center salmon
Bangladesh huge number of refugees
Ugandan are absorbing refugees but
providing programs for them but that's
the kind of civilization at the West
can't aspire to which is very well you
know if you think about American history
the imperialism didn't start recently
the United States is one of those very
rare maybe unique countries which has
been at war almost constantly from the
from its first day that we don't call it
imperialism but remember that one of the
main reasons for the Revolutionary War
was that the British were banning
settlers from moving past the Allegheny
Mountains and the settlers including
great land speculators like George
Washington wanted to move to the west
and what happens when you move one
second no doing this John Quincy Adams
simply described the fate of that
hapless tribes of Indian nations which
we are exterminating with such merciless
cruelty meanwhile we conquered half of
Mexico moving where I'm now living at
what General Grant president Grant
pulled one of the most wicked wars in
human history war of aggression then
comes the 20th century constant
interventions world war period all over
the place porosity since the Second
World War the invasion are you rubbing
in the microphone no you're not way up
in the air can you speak up a little
louder
sorry House any better yes okay I'll get
closer to the screen it's not the screen
where's the microphone thank you for
your patience what about the possibility
of a wider war for example an attack on
Iran to distract attention from domestic
issues well the United States
certainly can you hear me now yes yeah
the United States certainly setting the
grounds for an attack on Iran after a
member that Iran has been an enemy since
1979 when they overthrew the dictator
that the u.s. had imposed in a coup 25
years earlier and they've been since
since then they've been independent not
following orders that's not tolerable
right after the 79 overthrow the
dictator the u.s. immediately turned to
support for the Iraqi invasion of Iran
supporting our friend Saddam Hussein
huge etre hundreds of thousands of
people killed and poison gas chemical
warfare right after that harsh sanctions
which continued there was a slight break
when the Obama administration did agree
to negotiate terminating the Iranian
nuclear programs is quite a successful
agreement not just the u.s. the European
countries five major European the major
European countries China Russia
everybody joined in the Trump
administration has pulled out of it of
course now it's imposing a much harsher
sanctions plenty of threats of up to the
level of regime change I don't think
that they're crazy enough to invade Iran
they learned some lessons in Iraq much
weaker target but I think there's is a
possibility that there could be an
attack bear in mind that the u.s. is
organizing a an alliance of the most
reactionary states in the region
Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Egypt
under the harshest dictatorship of its
history in
right in the center of it all under the
US aegis to try to rim to ensure the
imposition of US domination over the
remains the world's major center of
energy resources in areas vast
geopolitical significance could lead to
an attack but I suspect if there is one
it would be from a safe distance cruise
missiles bombers and so on which would
have horrible consequences to support
stations like how to achieve a break
well there's only one way to do it a
large mass of the population must come
to recognize that the system is too
resistant to efforts to reform and
improve it to allow further such efforts
to persist and then move to further
actions we're very far from that there's
plenty of room for very significant
reform in fact as some of the quotes I
gave earlier indicate if we were to go
back to Eisenhower conservatism it would
be a big step forward a big step forward
remember those were the years of what's
sometimes called regimented capitalism
the New Deal regulations were still
imposed banks were banks no financial
crises and though no massive speculate
and predatory institutions it was the
fastest growth period in American
history of egalitarian growth the lower
lowest quintile that as good as the
highest it was plenty wrong with plenty
of horrible things but but by
contemporary standards it had it had
severe defects like the achievements of
the 1960s hadn't yet taken place but in
socio-economic terms it was improved
that's why you have sentiments like
Eisenhower's and we can certainly go far
beyond that there are ways to erode the
capitalist structure from within and
they're being undertaken so one
important series of developments is the
spread of a very large scale spread of
the cooperative worker owned enterprises
localism and food supply many other
initiatives of this kind which sort of
build the institutions of a fairer more
free society within the present one and
that could continue how far it can
continue we don't know but such efforts
have to be pushed to their limits and
again it's only when a great mass of the
population recognizes that the limits
can go further that you can anticipate
constructive substantial even
revolutionary change Antonio Gramsci the
great Italian he talked about morbid
symptoms arising as civilizations
decline I'd like you to talk about that
and also his famous Antonio Gramsci from
his he was
sentenced to prison in order as the
prosecutor said openly in order to
silence his voice became one of the
leading political prisoners from the 20s
incidentally that's just happened again
in Brazil where the most popular
candidate Lula as he's known by everyone
who was said to win the election was
sentenced to what amounts to life
imprisonment and solitary confinement
banned from receiving any public
information and crucially banned from
making any public statement this is
right before the election which he was
set to win the alleged crimes whatever
you think about them are so utterly
disproportionate from the nature of the
sentence that it's a it's creating a
political prisoner which is very
reminiscent of grant Gramsci in order
silence this voice forever and in prison
grumpy in the early 30s did talk about
what he said is that the old order is
collapsing and the new order has not yet
arisen and in this anti rectum there are
many morbid symptoms and that looks
familiar the old order is collapsing all
through Europe every election the
centrist Institute
political institutions are declining
eroding forces are developing them
unfortunately on the right also on the
left and a very much the same happened
here the 2016 election the Republican
Party was pretty much wiped out it
became the Trump Party which roughly
serves the same masters but not the
individual who the establishment
preferred on the Democratic side the of
spectacular development was the Sanders
movement
the first time in American political
history that somebody person who was
basically unknown no media support and
no financial support from the wealth or
corporate power came very close to
gaining the nomination very well might
have gained it that's just a sharp break
and very similar to what's happening in
in Europe incidentally also in Brazil
the center-right party the party of the
previous prime minister Cardozo
disappeared was totally wiped out
instead of neo-fascist
extremists one the party the center
left's decline severely partly its own
fault but did another terrible attack
these are the these are and out of this
does grow morbid symptoms the kind we
were talking about as you know phobia
racism misogyny hate crimes and so on
and it could get more serious I
mentioned before something quite
significant about the American political
system so what made a certain amount of
sense in the 18th and the 18th century
with all of its severe flaws the
American constitutional system was a
step forward plenty wrong with it well
big step forward by eighteenth century
standards even the very phrase We the
People which was revolutionary at that
time putting aside how it was
implemented with the idea you take a
look today that same political system is
so regressive it would not be accepted
by say the European courts as a if a new
country came in with a political system
and with the radical shift that's taking
place
we're already 60% senators are elected
by states with 25% of the population
that means are elected by maybe 15% of
the
halation tendency that's growing and a
sharp split dividing you can see it on
the electoral map unless the Democrats
can become what they once sort of were a
party of working people in the poor or
at least to a large extent unless that
can happen this is there may be some
really severe morbid symptoms no I'm
putting my bets on the public to compel
the Democrats to reform which is
something quite different and also to
recurve what the Republicans are doing
when I said the most dangerous
organization in human history I wasn't
exaggerating we have to bear that in
mind you can't find any organization in
human history which is doing what they
what the leadership is doing knowingly
consciously moving towards imminent
devastation in order to enrich a few
super rich people you can't find an
analogue to that
just a couple more questions you're
doing okay yeah great how do you reach
people who are oblivious and impervious
to facts by trying harder do you even
bother oh yeah try harder we're all
human beings at bottom first of all you
have to understand why it's not just you
know I'm a there are background
reasons that have led to this situation
but some of them are pretty clear for
example many they working-class people
who voted for Trump voted for Obama they
weren't right that they didn't vote for
Obama because they were racists they
voted for Obama because they believed
his rhetoric about hope and change
I don't usually quote Sarah Palin but
she had a point when she asked that what
happened to this hopi changing business
within a couple of years that people
could perceive that the hope and change
was nice fancy rhetoric already by 2010
two years after Obama's election there
was an election in Massachusetts the
most liberal state the election was to
replace Ted Kennedy the liberal lion the
Republicans won the election largely
because even union workers were
unwilling to get out and vote for Obama
after what they'd seen so that there's a
background as a background for the
reason why people are angry very
resentful hating political institutions
easy prey for a con man and if he tells
them I'm your hero I'm defending you and
maybe they believe it then they'll
believe him when he says don't believe
the media don't listen to facts just
listen to the facts are what the Jared
Kushner recently called false reality
nice phrase yes people are prey to that
but it's not their genes its
circumstances that have created it and
those can be changed
you've hinted at a couple of
possibilities for political action what
needs what else needs to be done in the
next couple of years given the eco
crisis that is about to envelop us well
two major things have to be done there
are two truly existential threats cast a
shadow over everything else the one is
nuclear war and we know how to reverse
that we can return to arms control
treaties in fact much better ones we can
cut off the threat to of possible war in
Iran there are very straightforward ways
of doing that it's going to take
large-scale public pressure and activism
but that's within our reach it's
happened before the activism of the 60s
made it a much more civilized society
there's probably more people engaged
today than they were then and if they're
organized and dedicated they can achieve
a lot
the second is ecological catastrophe and
we simply have to heed the warning of
the IPCC which as I said was shortened
soon after shown to be underestimated
and terminate the use of fossil fuels
these initiatives that were just voted
down in the last election they have to
be instituted people can Institute them
they can carry out actions in many ways
from you know changing to LED bulbs to
using solar panels to political action
and ultimately it really has to be on a
massive scale
this also includes things and should not
overlook it like industrial meat
production which is extremely harmful in
many ways not even considering the
animals but one of the things is doing
is adding enormous amounts of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere all that can
change there are many ways to work
there's time too
to hold things back in reverse course
there also ought to be much more
research and development on advanced
technology that's scandalous that solar
technology is spearheaded in China a
poor country that's where they're
producing nominally the great majority
the panel's with the most sophisticated
ones we have to look at things like
decarbonisation many other things
so there's many directions in which
activity has to proceed and that's just
the existential threats when we talk
about these other things there with
ingress
in fact I didn't pick up your reference
to the maxim that grump she made famous
we should think about it seriously we
can have pessimism of the will but
pessimism of the intellect but we should
have optimism of the will that's our
only hope why did you go and what
transpired
well valerian my wife and I uh she's
Brazilian went to we went to Brazil in
large part to become involved in the
torrid political activities there before
the election and one of the first things
we did was arrange to visit Lula in his
prison Cordoba which is possible to do
in a very limited ways allowed for his
limited visitors and at the time we
visited him it still looked hopeful that
there might be a way to beat back this
neo-fascist threat right now it looks
pretty horrible but nothing's ever over
talk about the future artificial
intelligence and robotics in a few years
well first of all it's worth noticing
that so far at least there is no real
indication that robotics although
they're coming along or having a really
visible effect detectable effect on jobs
if if automation was really having a
major effect you would see it in
productivity the more working people are
replaced by robots the higher
productivity measures productivity is
extremely low it's well below what it
was in the 50s in the 60s now this is
coming there's no doubt it could be a
good thing could be very bad thing
depends on how the technology is handled
if automation and robotics eliminates
dangerous boring mind destroying
occupations and frees people to be more
creative independent to pursue their own
interests to enhance their capabilities
even to have more leisure that's all to
the good
speaking of leisure Americans are
enormous ly overworked by Western
standards by the standards have given
their the wealth of society compared
with others Americans work five or six
more weeks a year than Europeans which
is insane so if robotics could have all
of these effects that's beneficial but
it depends who's gonna have their hand
on the lever that could easily happen if
an organized engaged activist population
has their hand holding the lever if the
hand is private concentrations of power
it's going to be different and very ugly
but the technology doesn't care the
technology can be used for good or for
ill optimism the will and support kjn
you finally so many interviews seem to
turn on this question of hope and people
are curious about you personally in
terms of what inspires you wouldn't
as maize things like the fact that say
right here there's a lively activist
community it's lasted for a long time
the community radio Center is an
energizing force there are things like
this all over as I mentioned the Sanders
campaign broke with well over a century
of American political history it's
pretty impressive and the offshoots of
it are active effective doing lots of
things they're very important the
younger people entering the political
system like co-ceo Cortez and others
there were defeats in this election but
there were victories too and we should
as I say remember what the past was it
wasn't very long ago that the United
States had laws which were modeled for
Nazi Germany in the late 60s as late as
the 1960s the US had anti-miscegenation
laws so severe that when the Nazis were
developing the Nuremberg Laws their
racist laws and looking for precedents
they did pick the American laws they
were the only ones they could find but
the American laws were too severe for
them the Nazis weren't willing to go as
far as the one drop of blood requirement
that was nineteen sixties in the
nineteen as late as fifteen years ago we
had anti sodomy laws think about as late
as 1975 women were not considered peers
in the legal system it was only in 1975
that Supreme Court guaranteed the right
of women to serve as peers and federal
juries was a one part of a very
substantial change enormous changes took
place through the activism of largely
young people
against many barriers much harsher
barriers than today and a lot was
achieved
there was a harsh reaction the
neoliberal period is in many ways a
reaction to that but that can but we
start now from a higher plane we have
the legacy of those past achievements
and plenty of people are taking
advantage of that's plenty of reasons
for hope
and saving the most difficult question
for this right now what famous
intellectual activist was born in
Philadelphia on December 7 19 20 8
turning 90 years old well if you look at
his birth certificate it says of rain
Naomi
Chomsky because it's a sign of the
change of the times the name is Avram no
but some clerk couldn't believe it so he
crossed the name out in pencil and
changed norm than they owe me and Avram
to have reigned because women are
allowed have crazy names thank you so
much for joining us my pleasure Thank
You Noam Chomsky and kg and you
