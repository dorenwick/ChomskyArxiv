now is it me or has politics if not a
world gone completely nuts Governor
Ronda Sanz from Florida has declared war
on Donald Trump Boris Johnson is
threatened to sue the British government
the tyrannical Maniac Putin continues to
terrorize Ukraine well no chomski or the
father of modern Linguistics as many
call him is in my view one of the great
minds of Our Generation he's a linguist
a philosopher a fiercely outspoken
political activist authored over 150
books looking at the crumbling fabric of
society I'm GL to say that n chonky
joins me now from his home in
Massachusetts Mr chonky what a pleasure
to have you on the program pleasure to
be with you I I wanted to start by
asking you there's a a famous Doomsday
Clock based on what a lot of experts
perceive to be the moment the world
basically ends that clock is now heading
towards the dreaded midnight uh at a
fast rate we're nearer to Doomsday
according to experts than we've ever
been do you think think I mean you're 94
years old you've LED an extraordinary
life you've seen lots of things not
least world wars um what do you think
about the state of the world right now
and are we right to be perhaps concerned
that doomsday is on its
way well the Doomsday Clock was set in
1947 shortly after
the bombings of Hiroshima Nagasaki
at that point it was 7 Minutes to
Midnight couple of years later in
1952 moved to 2 Minutes to Midnight when
United States and
Russia exploded thermonuclear weapons
showing that human intelligence had
Advanced if that's the right word to the
point where it could destroy everything
oscillated since in the Trump years it
moved back to two minutes later the
analysts abandoned minutes altogether
moved to seconds it's now said at 90
seconds to
midnight for good reasons said in
January I presume it'll move still
forward towards midnight we are now
facing questions that have never Arisen
in human history they will have to be
answered soon or else we're essentially
finished one of course is the threat of
nuclear war which is growing both in
Europe and in Asia the other is the
inexorable March towards climate
destruction we have a couple of decades
in which to deal with it methods are
pretty well known if we don't pursue
them we will pass IR reverse versible
tipping points and there will be a
steady decline
to undescribable catastrophy that's
where we stand
now I mean I would add a third to that
potentially purely based on what
Professor Steven Hawking told me in what
turned out to be his last television
interview which when I asked him what
was the biggest threat to mankind he
said when artificial intelligence learns
to
self-design then that's it
um there are some experts out there in
the world of AI who believe we may be
approaching uh that eventuality what's
your view of of AI and that threat I
think that's mostly science fiction I
mean in principle it is possible to
reach what's called Singularity to reach
a point where AI might move on
independently but this is such a remote
contingency that I really don't see any
it doesn't seem to me worth considering
very seriously especially when we think
of the imminent catastrophes that are
quite
real on the on the catastrophes that you
outlined taking the first one of nuclear
war how close do you think we're getting
to that potentially happening with this
war in Ukraine and in other words if
Ukraine with its offensive was to push
Vladimir Putin back if it looked like
back home in Russia he may be losing the
war or is even driven out
altogether do you think he's potentially
the kind of person who might actually
use a nuclear weapon to seize back
initiative well that's it's
conceivable uh tactical nuclear weapons
have apparently been placed in
belas uh the West is taking a ghastly
gamble they assuming that uh if Russia
faces defeat which does not look too
imminent but if they do that Vladimir
Putin will pack his bags slink away
silently to Oblivion or worse uh will
not use the weapons that everyone knows
he has to escalate the war up to the
point of attacking NATO supply lines in
Western Ukraine in which case there's
growing confrontation with NATO that
once you step on the escalation ladder
it's very hard to stop so it's possible
there's also a serious possibility of
nuclear war in Asia in fact us top
military officials generals have
predicted that within a couple of years
we'll be in a war with
China should be understood that a war
between nuclear Powers is
inconceivable it means
termination if a country major nuclear
power carries out a first strike it
itself is likely to be destroyed even if
there's no
retaliation If Only from the effects of
nuclear winter these are not conceivable
possibilities but top strategists are
talking about them and planning for them
in fact Us official policy strategic
policy since
2018 has been to be prepared to fight
two nuclear Wars with China two Wars but
of course they become nuclear Wars with
China and Russia this is beyond
insanity but what do you do if you have
a dictator like Vladimir Putin who
thinks it's completely acceptable to
illegally invade a sovereign Democratic
country in an in an effort to restore
the Soviet Union to its zarik Glory Days
as he would put it or if you're
president G and you you've made it
pretty clear you want Taiwan back where
it belongs as you see it uh and you
decide to do the same with Taiwan what
does the rest of the world do I mean do
we not have a moral duty to stand up to
that kind of thing the first thing we do
is try to be clear about the facts
Vladimir Putin said that it was a
disaster for the Soviet Union to be
destroyed but he added any one who
thinks it can be restored is out of his
mind that part of the quotation is not
given in the west with regard to Asia
there has been for 50 years a an
agreement between the United States and
China it's called The One China policy
it was established in the
1970s firmly explicitly
unambiguously say that China that Taiwan
is part of China but neither side will
undertake provocative actions to change
this situation it's called strategic
ambiguity it's held the pieace for 50
years which is not inconsiderable in
international Affairs China is still
maintaining that position the United
States is abandoning it the United
States is now accusing China of calling
for a one China policy which in fact is
true they do and that's the official
policy of the United States for the past
50 years now being abandoned uh with
quite provocative actions and plans for
further escalation I can read you the if
you look at the official Doctrine it's
it's not secret the United the official
Doctrine is to encircle China with a
ring of Sentinel
States uh at us allies um South Korea
Japan Australia Guam arm them with
Advanced Precision weapons aimed at
China U provided of course by the United
States you know it says now escalating
that by sending b52s that
nuclear capable b52s with cruise
missiles to permanent stationing for the
first time in Guam US military Outpost
Northern Australia uh flying time to
China meanwhile the US is quite openly
publicly calling for a commercial a war
to pre prevent China from develop
developing official statement is we have
to prevent China's Innovation and
development me other provocative acts
are being taken U Advance increasing
diplomatic relations contrary to the
agreement in the one China policy in the
1970s as I mentioned but but let me ask
you let me ask you I mean if China not
withstanding everything you've just said
if China did invade Taiwan what would be
the morally correct response of the West
and in particular America the morally
correct stance is to prevent it from
happening there is no indication that
China is planning to invade Taiwan if
the United States increases the
escalation they might do it uh in that
case the bars are down you can't say if
you move on to war with China we're
basically all finished but there is
really no point considering a remote
contingency when there are actual events
taking place like the US escalation of
the confrontation with China China's not
saintly by any means nothing like it but
if you look at the facts it's us
escalation the US is now enlisted trying
to enlist Europe in its confrontation
with China by expanding NATO us has
expanded NATO to the Indo Pacific region
turning it into an
international military system under Us
control uh all of this is going on we
can if we like talk about the possible
contingency of Taiwan of China invading
Taiwan for which there is no indication
though it could happen if we continue
the provocation remember the provoc
ation is serious it's both in the
military Dimension and in the commercial
Dimension quite openly what I've been
referring to is public policy very open
and it is increasing the threat you put
nuclear capable b52s in flying distance
to China with nuclear tipped cruise
missiles that's provocation well I mean
they would argue of course that it's
defensive that they're actually these
are protective measures they're not
provocative measures they would argue
that China's march to economic
imperialism and their massive expansion
of their military represents an
existential threat if they misuse those
Powers that's what they would argue and
therefore what they're doing is
protecting themselves and other
countries from from nefarious Behavior
by China I would suggest distinguishing
between Western propaganda and the facts
so let's take China's military
buildup this is reported regularly by
sepri Swedish priest Research Institute
you can pick it up on the internet you
will find that China's
military expenditures for the past 10
years per capita military expenditures
are a flat straight line they have not
increased
of course the uh China has increased its
military as the population increases but
it's way below US military expenditure
and the US is far above in technological
advances so yes and China remember is
faced with security problems at every
border the United States is faced with
no security problems but US military
expenditures
dwarf they're about the same as the next
10 countries all together it's a per
capita far beyond China so yes there is
and what when we talk about this
economic imperialism exactly what are
referring to we're referring to
investment and development programs
throughout Eurasia expanding to Africa
expanding even to Latin America the US
is trying to stop them has found no way
to do it except by escalating in the
military and economic Dimensions by
trying openly publicly to try to prevent
China's economic if you don't mind me uh
the risk of sounding impertinent but you
sound very trusting of China and its
motivations no not in the least I said
explicitly China is by no means s
saintly plenty of criticisms you can
make of China but I would like to
describe the world situation as it is
not as it's presented by us British
propaganda okay let's move to another
issue I think we have more common ground
on Free Speech it seems to me has never
been under more ferocious attack in the
west than it is right now why is that
and what do we do about it there
definitely is an attack on freedom of
speech even freedom to read in the
United States U Ronda Sanders running
for president as he just announced has
imposed regulations laws in Florida
which make it illegal to teach uh
authentic American history history you
have to teach a kind of History which
glorifies the United States nothing
about what actually happen this is
happening in Republican legislatures
around the country the libraries are
being forced to throw out books there's
uh laws passed to say their topics
you're not allowed to talk about well he
would argue I mean to santis would argue
I've interviewed him he would argue that
he is focused on things like critical
race Theory which he feels is
inappropriate for teaching young
children he thinks that gender ideology
should not be taught to young children
and has a lot of support a lot of
Floridians agree with him about this
critical race Theory what is critical
race Theory does anybody know critical
race theory is a slogan invented by the
rightwing and the person who invented it
Christopher rufo has been very open and
fr
he says we just use this as a way to
refer to everything we hate if you want
to know what critical race Theory
actually is it's a small academic
discipline which suggests which
investigates systematic elements of
racis racism in American in they
certainly exist it's never reached the
schools schools wouldn't even know what
it is this is invented but by the right
wing exactly as rufo stated to refer to
everything we want we hate and want to
destroy like teaching American history
like uh uh teaching U gender issues we
hate that so we'll call it critical race
Theory but it's a small academic
discipline which no one ever heard of
until it was picked up primarily by rufo
then expanded through the Republican
Echo chamber to be some major attack
listen I don't I I don't disagree that
the right obviously have a lot of issues
on the far right in particular we've
seen a rise of white supremacy in
America a rise of farri uh domestic
terrorism and so on that's completely
inarguable but also we've seen a rise of
what I would call a very
strange uh version of liberalism this
very Ultra woke so-called liberalism
which I would liken more to Fascism orbe
it without the extreme violence but the
mindset of wanting to control how people
think wanting to cancel people for
having different opinions deplatforming
speakers you don't like at University
and so on which to me is the antithesis
of what liberalism was supposed to be
what do you think of that phenomenon
right I've been as you know probably
very much opposed to the actions of
small sectors of young people who are
picking up the traditional cancellation
which has been endemic in the academic
world and in the uh political world for
years I can give you examples from my
own experience cancellation of the left
has been constant it's only very you
want me to spend time I could tell you
from my own experience which is small of
it now small segments of young people
are picking up that same improper uh
policy and should be opposed we should
oppose it just as we should have opposed
the massive cancellation that has been
accepted for decades because it was
directed against the left and this isent
opinion so yes it's
wrong let me ask you uh no mean you're
like I said you're 94 years old is there
any great burning question in life that
you I find it hard to believe you
haven't found the answer to everything
given how massive your brain is but is
there anything left that you really you
would love to know the answer to that
you've never to your satisfaction worked
out well moving to another domain of
intellectual professional Pursuits there
is a question that was was asked by
Galileo then by his associates in the
17th century which is as yet
unanswered how are you and I able to do
what we are now
doing how as Galileo put it how is it
possible with a finite number of symbols
to produce an infinite number of
thoughts and
even use these symbols to allow
others who have no access to our minds
to uh access to their inner workings of
our minds how is this miracle possible
was raised by Galileo studied the major
concern for
decort uh other leading figures in the
17th century began with working on it U
We Now understand some aspects but the
major questions are not only unanswered
but we don't even know how to approach
an answer so that's a leading one of
many leading problems and what has been
what has been the when you look back at
your life what has been the greatest
moment of your life I can't say a lot of
Great Moments if I had the power to let
you relive One Moment in your life what
would you go
for some
moments are almost
miraculous like the birth of my first
child say uh many other things like it
but I don't see much Point talking about
my personal life and situation they more
important things in the world do you
feel the world is a is a better place
than when you were born or a worst
place well I was born in
1928 right before the Great
Depression which of course was far more
severe than anything we've suffered
recently uh fasc as I was growing up as
a young child fascism was spreading
through Europe it looked Unstoppable
actually the first article I remember
writing for a school
newspaper began with the fall of Austria
Czechoslovakia Barcelona was right after
the fall of Barcelona with Franco when
it seemed as if the fascist plague was
Unstoppable uh those were very dark
moments uh it U another extremely dark
moment was was August 6th
1945 when I was then 16 years old old
enough to understand was clear that
humans had were moving towards the
capacity to destroy everything that came
a few years later uh has the world
changed for the better in many ways take
the United States country anob best go
back to the 1960s
the
1960s the United States had antien laws
that were so extreme that the Nazis
refused to accept them in the united
1960s the United States did have
federally subsidized housing but it was
segregated not for blacks that meant a
black man could maybe get a job in a
auto plant during the boom period of the
50s but he couldn't use it to acquire
wealth wealth in the United States
mainly means property normous Legacy of
hundreds of years of slavery and Horrors
women's rights were not accepted in fact
in the
1960s in principle the United States
still accepted British common law which
the founding fathers had explicitly
accepted and Accord according to that
law Blackstone women were not persons
they were property the property of the
father handed over to the husband well
that was eroded over the years but it
literally wasn't until
1975 that the Supreme Court formally
determined that women are persons they
are peers they have a right to appear in
federal trial well all of these things
have changed those are all steps forward
forward it's now called wokeness but
it's a steps forward towards a more
caring
egalitarian just
Society sometimes goes overboard but on
the whole it's been a very positive
development when you again look at your
life and its totality what do you think
your greatest achievement has been
that's for other people to
determine you want to know what I think
it'll be something you never heard of
try
me for 25 years I was spending a great
deal of effort in the United States in
Britain to try to stop the worst
atrocity of the post-war period the US
british-backed
Indonesian invasion of East teore which
wiped out about a third of the
population that could have been stopped
instantly at any point was necessary to
try to engage large masses of the
population to compel finally
1999 did compel uh Bill Clinton to to
call it off something was
saved it seemed impossible How could a
small island of a couple hundred
thousand people resist an invasion by a
major country supported by the greatest
military powers in the world but it
finally
succeeded and you your support for that
is in your estimation your greatest
achievement in the area of social and
political policy one there are others I
was very active in from the early 1960s
when John F Kennedy radically escalated
the war in Vietnam from that point I
devoted enormous
effort to opposition to direct
resistance faced
imprisonment finally enough opposition
to develop to prevent Richard Nixon from
moving on to nuclear weapons as seemed
likely so that's an achievement it
certain was who who who has been for you
the best American president of your life
Lifetime and who's been the worst in my
lifetime FDR Franklin Delan or
rooseville and the
worst too much competition I'm
afraid I know you're know you're not a
massive fan of Donald Trump how do you
feel about him running again
no if he runs again it'll be a disaster
for the world for many reasons for one
thing Trump as you saw during his first
time is
dedicated actually his he has two
commitments one commitment is to himself
he's a parano he's
a
megalomaniac psychopath all that
concerns him is me the other commitment
is to serve corporate power and great
wealth abjectly is one legislative Achi
a m was a huge gift to tax gift to the
ultra wealth Ultra rich and the
corporate sector and nothing else but he
is a major climate
denialist he denies that global warming
is taking place he wants to maximize the
use of fossil fuels including the most
dangerous of them uh and to eliminate
regulations which might mitigate the
catastrophe that's a death sentence for
the human species domestically he's made
it very clear that he wants to Institute
what we would properly call a Proto
fascist State eliminate the Civil
Service since the mid 19th century like
every other de Democratic Society the
United States has been a has had a
nonpartisan Civil Service which does
most of the admin rtion which keeps
Society Running Britain has the same
others have the same Trump has made it
explicit that he wants to eliminate it
replace it by loyalists who put put in
power that
undercuts what remains a functioning
democracy we can go on it would be a
colossal disaster and it's not
unlikely you look at po yeah no I mean
he's he's he's way head in the
Republican nomination polls what do you
make of of over here in the UK bre
brexit which is now 8 years pretty much
since we voted to leave the European
Union well seven years um and there's no
sign of any of any benefit from leaving
the EU what do you think that was a a
sensible decision by Britain to do that
I thought at the time that it was a very
serious
error uh both harmful to Britain harmful
to Europe um in a way beneficial to the
United States
because under brexit Britain becomes
even more subject to us domination than
it was before uh but I thought it was a
terrible mistake and I think the record
since basically confirms that do you
think we should have a second referendum
most of the polls suggest if we did it
would be overwhelming support now to go
back into the
European
Union Biers remorse yes I'm not
surprised in fact that was the case
almost
immediately if you look back I mean you
know better than I do but if you look
back at the polls shortly after brexit
they did indicate uh substantial con uh
desire on the part of the population to
resend it that was a healthy position in
my opinion
who's been the the single greatest
public figure of your lifetime in the
world any anyone of any kind there are
many one of
them this is a tragic
example is a very close personal friend
for 50
years
now facing terminal cancer
been moved to
hospice Dan
ellsburg I think what he did was
magnificent one of the great well I
suppose how would you describe him for
those who don't know his
story well people should know his story
Dan was working at the top level of us u
u intelligent had one of the highest uh
class it was very much at the center of
strategic planning and uh uh
analysis he decided that there was a
secret history Robert
mcnamer Secretary of Defense had
commissioned a secret history of the
Vietnam War Dan at the very top level
knew about it he and his friend Tony
Russo both working at the ran
Corporation at the high you can't call
it top secret it's way above that didn't
even have a
classification they decided that the
American population should know what had
been done in the worst crime since the
second world war shouldn't be kept
secret so they copied it released it
tried to get the press to cover it but
finally the actually Dan I was I he did
give me a copy of it so I was able to
write about it as soon as it became
public uh bits and pieces of it were
leaked in the Press then exent
Administration tried to block it Supreme
Court overruled them so it did finally
appear uh then he went on for the rest
of his life to try to bring to the
population
understanding and knowledge of the
highlevel nuclear policies which are so
shocking that it's almost impossible to
talk about them so nuclear policies
going back to the early
1960s call for obliteration of China if
there is a confrontation in
Berlin nothing to do with China but you
got to use all the forces you have those
are the scops the actual proposals Dan
tried very hard not with too much
success unfortunately to try to bring
the American population and the world to
understand the Hideous horrendous
threats of terminal nuclear war that are
right on the verge and if you look over
the history of the nuclear system it's
kind of of a miracle that we've survived
there've been case after case which came
very close very close much too close to
moving on to terminal destruction well
if you if you had if we knew this was
going to be our last day on Earth I
asked Professor Hawking this actually I
said how would you spend it and he said
he would get his family together he
would play Vagner very loudly and he
would drink fine champagne
if you knew it was all about to end how
would you spend your last day I would
get my family together but skip the
rest finally know jsky it's been an
absolute uh pleasure to talk to you so
fascina I talked to you for hours um
what would you like your legacy to be if
you could write your own heading on your
own Tombstone here lies Nome chsky he
what would you like the rest of that
sentence to say he tried his best
I think that's that's absolutely correct
and your best was extremely good and is
extremely good um chonski thank you very
much indeed for joining me I appreciate
it thank you very much
