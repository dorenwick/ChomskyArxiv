either there will be a world without war
or there won't be a world the words of
the political scientist and philosopher
NM Chomsky but Wars there are a plenty
from Ukraine to the Middle East to the
West self- styled war on terror so how
is this world to survive n Chomsky joins
us now from Boston n Chomsky thanks for
joining us Ukraine a possible ceasefire
on
Sunday how worried are you about Putin
and about the West's reaction to him and
to Ukraine to
Ukraine it's no doubt a serious and
threatening
situation the ceasefire is welcome but
uh it's a glimmer of hope as was pointed
out we'll have to wait and see but the
but the
confrontation uh is quite serious uh the
Europeans are M making an effort to try
to reach a peaceful
accommodation but it's not going to be
easy there are serious issues involved
well do you believe that we acted
rightly over Crimea do you think that in
fact the West have dealt with the
antecedants of this problem
intelligently
intelligence well the antecedence of the
problem go back to uh the fall of the
Berlin Wall uh immediately
afterwards
gorbachov made a remarkable proposal he
offered to allow a unified Germany to
join a NATO hostile military Alliance
looking at the history of the century
that's quite a concession there was a
quidd proquo the term that was to Bor
take the term that was used there was a
promise a verbal promise by the United
States that uh NATO would not expand one
inch to the east meaning East
Germany uh they at once expanded NATO to
East Germany when gorbachov protested he
was informed correctly that it was only
a verbal agreement there was nothing on
paper uh Clinton then expanded NATO even
further uh all the way to the border of
Russia well those May those may be our
our mistakes but what about Putin I mean
surely this is a man who is beginning to
take the world backwards take the world
backwards well it depends what you mean
by backwards I mean I I don't admire
Putin but if you we have to recognize
what's happening uh the new government
of Ukraine has recently announced uh its
plans to join NATO uh just imagine say
that in the
1980s the Warsaw Pact had expanded
through much of Latin
America uh Mexico announced its plans to
join the Warsaw Pact uh how would the
United States have reacted well of
course it's academic because long before
that eventuality there would have been
extreme violence uh that's not a bad
analogy that does not justify Putin's
reactions but we have to understand
understand the situation that Russia
faces with expansion of a hostile
military Alliance can I right to its
strategic can I take you to uh the can I
take you to the other the theater of
terrible insecurity the Middle East
dominated Suddenly by this war with ISIS
is that something that we can win is it
is there going to be a caliphate for all
time do you see Isis as defeatable
should it befe defeated it be defeated
well Isis is an utter
monstrosity it's an outgrowth of
essentially two factors first the US
British Invasion of Iraq which
incited sectarian conflicts which are
now tearing the country and in fact by
now the region apart and secondly the
extremist fundamentalist uh doctrines
along with funding coming from wahhabi
sa Saudi Arabia those have converged and
created a major monstrosity
unfortunately uh Isis the Islamic
caliphate is now almost a representative
of Sunni a large part of Sunni Islam
that's an
tragedy sadly we've run completely out
of time but I hope you'll come on again
soon and we'll continue thank you very
much indeed for joining us e
