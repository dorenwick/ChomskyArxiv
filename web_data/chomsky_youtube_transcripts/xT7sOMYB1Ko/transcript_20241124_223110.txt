yeah professor if biden
refuses to act as a sort of modern day
fdr and refuses to implement uh
a social democratic agenda more or less
do you fear that
there could potentially be a more
competent version of trump
who takes over and the country will turn
far right
it's very possible and we shouldn't
underestimate trump's competence
he was a political genius
he succeeded in something which is
extremely
difficult a legislative program
which robbed and attacked the working
class and the poor
poured money into the super rich
and the corporate sector on one hand
and maintaining a rabid base of popular
support
from the people he was on the other hand
that's competence takes skill
uh he also succeeded
very effectively in destroying
smashing every possible thing
you can see in the international arena
that is beneficial sometimes essential
for human survival his wrecking ball was
very impressive
he wrecked the arms control regime
i poured money into new and more
dangerous weapons
sharply increasing the threat of
terminal nuclear war
and the other major
human issue the pending environmental
catastrophe
erased toward the abyss
maxima trying to maximize the use of
fossil fuels
including the most destructive
eliminating
the regulatory system which uh
somewhat mitigated the effects the
lethal effects and we don't have much
time as a decade or two to deal with it
his uh battering ram
made a big difference a world health
organization
which essential for the health the
revival of huge numbers of people
in poor countries all over the world
africa
yemen elsewhere he tried to destroy that
was quite successful in doing so the
kovacs consortium
international consortium almost the
entire world
which is in principle at least
dedicated to trying to ensure that
the poor and needy get the vaccines that
they're not monopolized by the rich
hasn't been very successful but at least
it's trying
but trump decided to direct that in fact
you look across the board
it's amazingly uniform
anything that can serve human interest
destroy it everything that can harm
human interest
maximize its impact harm the working
class and the poor
sharply through your legislative
programs and at the same time
maintain a rabid base of support
which is close to half the country
that's pretty impressive it's not
incompetent
it's extremely destructive
devastating but confident so will
somebody else come along who can pick
that up
maybe maybe somebody will come along who
doesn't add to it the kind of
vulgar ridiculous addicts that finally
even alienated the people who be serving
with dedicated passion the
super rich and um corporate sector they
did finally turn against
him it was very striking on january 6
they were basically marching orders from
the people who
effectively on the country chamber of
commerce
national association of manufacturers
ceos of major corporations
they all said straight out game's over
get out enough and i said the senators
started running for the egg
