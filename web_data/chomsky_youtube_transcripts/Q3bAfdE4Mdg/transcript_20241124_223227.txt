along with nuclear war a constant threat
uh we're facing the human species is
facing a literally a decision as to
whether to survive or not it's never
happened in human history but we're now
facing because of environmental
catastrophe which is a consequence of uh
the failure of market-based economic
systems to consider what are called
externalities you know effects on others
when you carry out transaction which is
destroying the
environment consequence of
industrialization basically uh we have
to face the question are we going to
control it or not if we don't we're
finished now there was a conference in
Paris last December which have
reached some sorts of agreements I mean
not nowhere near enough but at least
something the goal of the conference
which was actually announced by the
French organizers was to reach a verif
iable treaty that would impose limits on
carbon
dioxide pollution they couldn't and
there was a very simple reason the US
Republican party which was plain and
explicit read it in the New York Times
the Republican Party simply will not
accept the treaty and in fact every
Republican candidate now is a climate
change Deni or he says don't do anything
about it well that's virtually a death
na to the species and it's happening so
that yes that is an element of us
power a an extreme maybe the most
dangerous one in history if you think
about the
consequences um um talking about the
harmful side there are you can find
things that are worth were worth doing
but the dangers and the threats of
enormous power have always been
ominous and now remain so
