[Music]
and you hear me I can hear you and am I
audible as well
good
can you hear me too
yup this is fine captions
ah right fine
um so before we start um how long do we
have Professor Chomsky
yeah
it's aim for
45 minutes
all right well let's uh get to it so I
have a couple of topics I would like to
discuss Professor Chomsky
um first of all the newest Fad in
education called chat GPT
and the future of Education secondly I
would like to talk about critical
pedagogy
thirdly I would like to talk about your
newest book
and I would like to end
um with uh the pandemic or the end of
the pandemic so these are four topics I
would like to discuss in these 45
minutes okay
um so first of all I really like your
new haircut
um Professor Chomsky because
it takes up 10 years my wife couldn't
stand looking at me anymore she insists
I want it to look like Moses
well you did yeah yeah so she persuaded
you to touch your hair well it looks
great thank you uh so I was uh wondering
how
every day I see a new interview of you
appearing on on YouTube you must you
must be doing at least one interview a
day you have a really rigid interview
so uh how many interviews and media
appearances do you have on a yearly
basis
three today
theories talk that one was a talk and an
interview
but several hours a day usually several
hours every day except Sunday maybe
then there's classes meetings other
things
pretty busy yeah I can't imagine so
nice well it's good to talk to you again
it's really good to have you on the show
again
um so I was wondering at 94 still having
this rigid interview schedule what's
what's your routine how do you stay fit
do you have do you have a daily routine
foreign
that any doctor would approve of
mostly sitting at the computer ready
well I I know you have dogs so you must
be taking a walk every day the word
because they'll hear it all right see
here it will run for the door
it's paraphrases yeah yeah yeah yeah
no no no no specials right under the
desk as soon as there's an interview
yeah so no special routines no no glass
of wine at one o'clock or I don't know
some gymnastics before you start your
day nothing it's genetic I suppose
so
um chat GPT I'm a teacher uh and um you
know it's it's the fad of the day Chad
GPT children around the globe
um assign uh their homework to check gbt
they give a prompt and they will say
please write a book report about
um I don't know um the withdrawal which
we're going to talk about later and
check GTP will generate a very nice book
report so
um what do you know about GPT have you
heard of this
um development of this latest fed in
education
well it's uh
I don't think it has anything to do with
education except undermining it chat GPT
is
basically high-tech plagiarism
it's a system that uh
accesses and astronomical amount of
data and finds regularities
strings them together
looks more or less like what somebody
could have written on this topic
basically plagiarism just happens to be
high-tech well plagiarism can be a
nuisance uh teachers
I mean as in the universities for
example and uh
departments where essays are required
for years there have been programs that
help professors detect uh plagiar
plagiarized essays
okay now it's going to be more difficult
because it's easier to plagiarize
but it's about the only contribution to
the education that I can think of that
it makes it harder to detect plagiarism
the systems have
absolutely no uh value with regard to
understanding anything about language or
cognition they tell you nothing about
that any more than plagiarism does
and there's in fact the more they
improve
the greater their flaws
for a very simple reason
these are systems that do just as well
for
actual languages as they would do for
impossible languages
so it's as if
somebody produced a new version of the
periodic table of the elements
which includes all the elements all the
possible elements
all the impossible elements and doesn't
make any distinction between them
could be if
absolutely no value to science or
understanding and that's basically what
these systems are
uh they may have some value for
something it's not obvious what
you were a university Professor how
would you deal with these kinds of
problems students using chat GTP to
generate reports and doing you know
homework
foreign
I mean when I spent most of my life at
MIT
it wouldn't happen there simply because
the students wouldn't even think of
doing it they were interested in the
topics so they pursued the topics a
student learns nothing from this of
course absolutely nothing
it's just a way of avoiding learning and
there were places where
the way to deal with it is to make the
educational program interesting enough
so that students don't want to avoid it
this is a way of avoiding education
it's kind of like
I mean there are
colleges I've talked to teachers who do
it who've been uh iPhones in class
because the students will sit there you
know having a chat with somebody on
their iPhone
well
one way to deal with that is to ban
iPhones another way to do it is to make
the class interesting enough so that
nobody would think of it
and that's the challenge
well doesn't this development you know
the fact that millions and millions of
students are using chat GPT to make
their homework assessments and book
reports just to tell you there is a huge
pandemic going on in education boredom
it's a sign that the educational system
is failing
if students aren't interested they'll
find a way to around it
I mean we've all taken classes in which
we had no interest and you studied
for the exam you know
got a good Mark two weeks later you
forgot what the course was about
well that's one form of Education not a
very good one
and unfortunately uh that's the form of
Education that's being
uh
driven forward under the
contemporary neoliberal programs
designed for efficiency what's called
efficiency
uh
metrical results that you can
put down somewhere used to read teachers
and schools
it's a kind of education that was
ridiculed during the Enlightenment was
compared with
pouring water into a vessel and letting
some of it drip out taking a test
now now it's considered the right way to
do it it's called teaching to test
absolutely the worst form of Education
and if you have a form of Education
which is has no appeal to students
doesn't interest them doesn't challenge
them
doesn't make them want to learn they'll
find ways out
maybe not come to class
so
um chapter is based on artificial
intelligence so it it can have a great
impact on the way we educate and the way
we experience education I know
um for a fact that Elon Musk is trying
to connect the brain to computers so how
long will it take do you think before
um a company like neurolink will be able
to connect the brain to a computer and
program I don't know part of the brain
so that we don't have to learn French
anymore
well I wouldn't worry about that
that's science fiction
almost nothing's known about the brain
but uh
allows us even to conceive of this I
mean you can't get to the point where
you can detect neural signals which
might uh
lead to an action being performed like
raising your hand
um maybe at that level but
learning French I wouldn't worry about
it actually we already have that you
don't need a neural link for
yeah take your computer I have a laptop
computer sitting here if I want to look
up something in French I just tap a
couple keys and I get it
so
yeah now nowadays Google Translate is
fast enough to to have a live
conversation with a Frenchman for
example you don't have to speak French
anymore I've experienced it not really
I mean I use Google Translate but you
never trust what you see it's a way of
determining whether some article is
worth reading
you get the gist of it and figure out
what it's about if you're really
interested in understanding you would
never trust Google translate or GPT chat
GPT that's if you want to get a general
idea
nothing I mean I have nothing against
things that are useful like right now
I'm using live transcription
is it basically achieved the same way
Brute Force but it's kind of useful I
mean I don't actually trust it if you
but if you look at it you'll see plenty
of errors
but uh it's much better it's it's a fine
assistance for someone who's hard of
hearing so that's good
it's like a visual aid if you're a
slight side has been or wearing glasses
if you can't see
so neurolink is not going to be a threat
to education anyway soon
um AI at least jet GPT is not going to
be an improvement at least not the way
it is now so if you have to guess what
education looks like in 30 years we we
don't have a neural link to be afraid of
we don't check GPT is not get really
going to be a threat so what is
education going to be like do you think
in 30 years
it's the choice of
Educators planners
government officials those who fund are
usually defund education
they'll determine if education is not
appealing to students
meeting their needs and concerns
there'll be all kinds of ways to avoid
it I'll tell you my own experience when
I went to college back in
1945 we had to take a
uh course in chemistry
big lifter course
I mean it was so boring I couldn't stand
it so I never went to class never
I had a friend who took pretty careful
notes and they used their notes to pass
the exams
uh I never went to the lab
and uh
I had the lab manual it's obvious the
way the lab experiments were going to
turn out so I just filled in the lab
manual
they knew what I was up to because when
they registered for the next term
I was charged for breakage at the lab
and I couldn't say I never don't even
know where the lab is
but you know that's the worst kind of
education yeah so the question what the
future of Education of course I took
courses which I was very interested in I
would pay attention work hard you know
try to learn what was going on well
that's what education ought to be
cultivating those interests and concerns
it fails to do so students will do what
I did in chemistry now they can do it
with chat chat bgbt yeah it reminds me
of the the the quote you always tell
people uh referring to a colleague who
tells a student who asks what are we
going to cover during class and your
colleague says it doesn't matter what we
are going to cover it's about what you
are going to discover and I think many
classes are far away from discovering
anything we're teaching to the test
one of the world's leading physicists at
MIT
has talked to his freshman class
he was asked by freshmen what are we
going to cover in this class that says
it doesn't matter matters would you
discovered
and that's real education but it's up to
the teacher to make sure that that's the
way it works
and uh
if that fails it's not necessarily the
teacher's fault so for example the
in the United States in the last 40
years has been a major effort to destroy
the educational system a lot of it just
by defunding so you go to a college now
they want to cut back on
professors meeting with students he used
adjuncts who were basically slave labor
you pay them nothing even graduate
students pay them even less
a lot of Administrators they're run by
business models
in the schools and lower schools the
teacher may have 50 Children you know
the problem is going to be keeping from
killing each other you're not going to
teach anything
uh well those are the uh
and the programs for teaching
like on it's bipartisan under the Obama
Administration
the programs are basically teaching to
test
as boring and stupid as possible
ensuring that nobody will ever learned
anything except maybe some skills you
know maybe they can uh
be maybe they can be skilled workers or
something like that
but uh
that's highly destructive of Education
not just in the United States and
Britain a couple of years ago one of the
major
cultural critics Stephen colini had an
article
when she said that he said that the Tory
government is trying to turn
first class universities into third
class commercial later prizes
by insisting that if you want to have a
Classics program at Oxford you have to
show that you can sell it on the market
well if you want to destroy the culture
that's the way to do it
we know that the Trump Administration
and Betsy DeVos had a really
a policy of privatizing education and
defunding public schools now we have a
Biden Administration uh how is he doing
when it comes to education
it's not as I mean the Trump
Administration was strict neoliberal
and their ideas education shouldn't
exist should just be private this is
quite explicit so Milton Friedman the
you know the
economic Guru of the Reagan
Administration I didn't believe they
should have public education
everybody should be out on the market
trying to survive somehow
and of course it's a way to you actually
look at the history
it was a way to start it in the 70s as
with Friedman's participation as a way
to avoid uh integrating the schools
it was a way to get around the Civil
Rights actions which were attempting to
integrate schools and if white wealthy
parents didn't want to uh one didn't
want integrated schools they could
they would go to religious schools and
other private schools and then expect to
have Public Funding for it Friedman was
strongly in favor of the fact he worked
with segregationist groups to try to
undermine the public education system
it's pretty ironic when you look at the
history because Mass public education
was a major U.S contribution to
democracy and functioning democracy in
the late 19th early 20th century U.S was
way in the lead
European countries came much later same
at the college level
the land-grant universities like MIT for
example were
an innovation in higher education that
the European countries didn't come to
until after the second world war this
was a century earlier
now the
so-called Libertarians the neoliberal
extremists want to destroy all the the
Betsy divorce was quite Frank about it
should Secretary of Education said we
shouldn't have education
it should be just private by now it's
even worse
there's a Supreme Court is now
sort of
kind of a heart rate Catholic uh run uh
Christian nationalists who think that
the public ought to fund the private
education
they're breaking down the First
Amendment
state barrier between State and religion
so it's the duty of secular parents to
fund
a religious
schools it's getting to that point
they're pretty Frank about it it's a
Christian nationalist movement based on
reactionary Catholic doctrines
not Pope francis's Church
let's stay in the field of Education I
would like to talk about a critical uh
pedagogy
um
I think one of the goals of Education
should be to to raise critical citizens
capable of assessing power assessing the
state of democracy uh assessing their
own environment and assessing the way
um they are living their own lives and
one of the books that really inspired me
was Paolo ferrera's uh pedagogy of the
oppressed this is the Dutch version but
you know his word have you ever met with
Palo frere by the way
uh well here you can see what life
transcription does
it says have you ever met Battlefront
no have you ever met Paulo yeah Polo
foreign I know his work but I never met
him actually I was in a his views were
somewhat similar to John Dewey's in the
United States and that I knew pretty
well in fact I went to a dewey8 school
when I was a child up until the high
school
very different and it's based on similar
ideas that the pretty much what you said
before that the goal of education is to
prepare uh
young people to be able to participate
effectively
constructively in a Democratic Society
not be tools with the hands of somebody
else which is what teaching to test is
so I was wondering if if it's possible
in American schools to have a form of
critical education or is the system
designed specifically to eliminate any
criticism on
the school system or politics or
whatever is it possible to have a
critical life battle right now
very life I think they're about 30
States Republican states states with
Republican legislatures which have
passed one or another kind of law
they don't put it this way but
essentially to prevent the teaching of
American history
and to replace it with patriotic slogans
it's not put in those words with the
words the way it's put is to ensure that
children meaning
privileged white children are not made
to feel uncomfortable in class
well you read American history you're
going to feel uncomfortable
if not not if you read patriotic slogans
or listen to Fourth of July aerations if
you look at the actual history you see
plenty to be uncomfortable about you
should
you should find out
what kind of society we have why it's
this way where it come from
should know all those things if you want
to participate in a Democratic Society
if you want to just follow orders
never ask questions then you know let's
not teach American history or Society or
anything else
uh the
fuss about critical race theory is
pretty much like that a lot of fewer but
critical race Theory no it's nobody
knows what it is in fact the leading uh
spokesman for uh putting putting
pressing on Banning and Christopher rufu
Manhattan Institute right-wing Institute
he said very clearly by critical race
Theory we just mean a covert term for a
lot of things we don't like you know
uh so it doesn't matter what this Arcane
field of legal analysis really is but
but the idea is to try to prevent
students from having an education
from coming to understand
what kind of world we live in
what kind of society we have
its achievements its injustices what
should be dealt with what are the
problems we have to face shouldn't do
then
and to be precise to be honest it's not
just the right wing
you can learn a lot about this by
looking at the Publications that came
out in the early 1970s
a very important period
because in the 1960s there was a wave of
popular activism
student activism
women's activism others it was a period
in which lots of challenges to Authority
Doctrine uh
racism sexism all sorts of issues came
on the agenda that scared the pants off
the establishment
across the Spectrum
at the rate there was a very harsh
reaction
at the What's called the left it was
more interesting
so one
document of
recommended since it appeared in 1975
and I've used many times is a book
called the crisis of democracy
very much worth reading it's a
it's from the
liberal internationalist element in
international Society liberal
internationalists in the United States
Europe and Japan
uh you get the complexion of it from the
fact that the Carter Administration was
drawn almost completely from their ranks
trilateral Commission
and what's the crisis of democracy
that there's too much democracy
the 1960s they say too many sectors of
the population
became engaged in the political Arena
pressing for their rights and interests
that's no good
they don't say it but what's implicit is
it's only the privilege and the powerful
folks like us we should run things the
rest of you go away and shut up and what
they called for is more moderation and
democracy so go home be passive in
acquiescent and we'll take care of
things actually that is liberal
democratic theory if you look at it I've
written a lot about it what do they say
about the universities that's
interesting
they say the inter universities are
failing in their task of
indoctrination of the young
indoctrination of the young that's the
task of the universities and they're
failing that's where you have these
kids out on the street opposing the war
in Vietnam calling for human rights
civil rights women's rights and so on we
don't want all that stuff so go back to
indoctrination of the young this is the
left of the spectrum
it's much harsher on the right
but it's across the Spectrum you know
and
you see it in the policies that followed
they take various forms but basically
improving the indoctrination of the
young
that's the left liberal position
what happens if we don't teach children
about critical race theory about the
slavery
the past uh what happens when we don't
teach kids about
um you know social emotional learning
and woke or subjects and topics that
were a threat to run the sentence run
the centers who ban dozens of books
instead of Florida what happens when we
don't teach children about the true past
um of The American Nation for example
what happens
if you don't teach them
of course you don't teach them and they
don't learn by themselves they won't
understand
why things are the way they are
why is there such an enormous Gap say in
wealth between black families and white
families huge gap why
you don't teach them the reasons it'll
engender racism must be something wrong
with them you know they're lazy they're
the wrong genes or something so if you
want a racist Society it's the way to do
it
if you teach them what the real answers
or what happened for 400 years
you get a different Society
same with Native Americans where they
stuck away in those reservations
because they're no good at anything
or is it because they had a rich Lively
civilization which was destroyed by
genocidal Invaders
which is well you won't understand the
way the world is where our privilege and
wealth came from what's uh what are the
injustices in our current Society
you have to know something about this
and therefore it's important if you want
to preserve
privilege clip means
not just privilege but white privilege
you have to make sure to suppress what
actually happened
and same with women's rights or anything
else where these women parading around
and demanding all sorts of things why
don't they go back and take care of
children in the kitchen where they're
supposed to be
as the Nazis insisted that's where the
women's belong
race children and take care of the
family will take care of the rest it's
kind of society you want don't teach
every half don't teach what happened
don't teach the fact that in the in the
for the founding fathers
uh women were not persons
literally they were property
the founding fathers of course took over
the English common law Blackstone
in which a woman is the property of her
father
hand it over to the husband the property
the husband at one of the
arguments against women giving women the
right to vote
rights to vote was that it would be
unfair to unmarried men
because in married men would have two
votes himself and his property
uh worth knowing that that lasted in the
laws until 1975.
1975 the Supreme Court finally ruled
that women had the right to serve on
federal juries meaning their peers
so technically they're then persons you
go back to the
second phase of the Constitution the
amendments after the Civil War excluded
women
they were not persons
well is it worth knowing that
I think so if you want to understand
this Society
but if you want to make sure you don't
understand it then or the teacher Board
of the schools from teaching it
I think the way you do it is by
concocting
fairy tales about how the wook movement
is trying to turn children into
sex slaves
I think about forget the percentage I
think maybe
half or so of the Republican Party think
the Democrats are
run by
pedophiles who are trying to groom
children
that's good propaganda
and it's a way of enraging parents
getting them to try to organize to stop
the schools from destroying their
children you know
talking about
physical education I think this book
will never be talked about in education
let's move on to your newest book I
think it's and he was one or have you
published another one
recently I mean
yeah so um
this book the withdrawal is about
um U.S imperialism Wars
um it says Iraq Libya Afghanistan uh but
it covers Vietnam and Laos as well
actually in the book and
um the book ends with Vijay prashad
reminiscing about his contacts with you
over the past 30 years
uh but there is no chapter in which you
talk about Fiji so I was wondering who
is Vijay and what does he mean to you
what do you admire at him about him he's
done fantastic work
more than
a good deal more than anyone else
he's
been the
historian and advocate for the poor
majority of the world
the global South
poor in the United States there's nobody
comparable
I mean it is both his scholarly work
which is excellent business is activism
that we're constantly on
interviews together he's always in some
other part of the third world you know
traveling around constantly working on
the problems that they face his
uh try Continental Institute is
at the Forefront of dealing with the
basic problems of the large majority of
the world who were bored and excluded
from our concerns and considerations
right just
saw that I read an article just today
which pointed out that the you're going
to have more
uh
impact on the leadership to deal with
global warming because of the decline of
CC scopes ski slopes in Switzerland and
because hundreds of millions of poor
people are starving in the third world
that's pretty accurate
you will have an effect at the Davos
conference they're worried about then
ski slopes
in fact I can see it right where I live
there's a drought in the southwest I
live in Arizona
uh plenty of green golf courses around
there's a concern
you know
the right wing is concerned that if you
put up two too many solar panels uh
take take up too much land so it's a big
problem
well it was an article studied England
turned out that the amount of land
used for golf courses is I think about
five times as much as used for solar
panels
you've got to have your priorities
correct
I'm mindful of the time so let's talk
about it shortly what's what first of
all why did you decide to
um co-author a book with Vijay on this
topic
well we've been
in contact for many years and
there is a striking
a Confluence of
collapses of the Imperial the measures
of the
of this Century the
subtitle gives the
illustration it seemed a good time to
try to write about the shape of the
world order that's developing
and in fact if we
were to do uh
a second edition right now
or maybe an update
we might refer to articles that are in
the newspapers right today
say reporting from Davis very
interesting
you can find one I think it's in
Politico today talking about how the
mood ish Davis is
the Masters of the Universe as they call
themselves you know the rich and
Powerful of the of the world it says the
mood is shifted it's from what we were
describing
withdrawal and decline to the new rise
in of U.S power and admiration for U.S
power because it's really showing its
muscle again
we're now showing that the U.S is
showing we can really Dominate and rule
the world so you better respect us uh
it's not that we're declining and
very excited about this major change
that's taking place we can go back to
the good old days when the U.S could run
things just by force and violence
of course that's not the terminology
they use but that's what it remounts to
so
um you also talk about Russia and
Ukraine but of course this was written I
think early in the year so there was not
a lot of information available but
certainly when there's a second edition
the UI go to include that chapter as
well I suppose well the of Putin's
invasion of Ukraine gave a real shot in
the arm to U.S power is a major gift to
the United States in many ways the
United States is benefiting enormously
from the war
one just militarily
small I mean Russia is the one military
adversary of the United States
and with a small tiny percentage of the
U.S military budget of the United States
is able to
destroy a large part of the Russian
military using Ukrainian bodies but to
sideline the uh so that's a real bargain
for the uh and beyond that in
geopolitical terms uh the Putin's
invasion drove Europe deep into the
pockets of the United States
to the detriment of Europe Europe's
declining and suffering but the United
States is benefiting enormously and now
you have to remember that through the
whole Cold War since night since the end
of the second World War
there's been a
conflict over this it's a nature and
future of Europe
has
a huge population Advanced economy
vast culture and so on should should it
be an independent force in world affairs
that's the goalless division uh Billy
brunt's hospitality
Olaf Palmer others said yes you're
pretty an independent third force not
subordinate to the United States
there's a conflicting Vision Europe
should be subordinate to the United
States
that's the Atlantis division
meaning under NATO which is run by the
U.S of course
this became a significant issue in
1990 it was a collapse of the Soviet
Union
Gorbachev proposed an expanded version
of the Godless the conception what he
called a common European home
from Lisbon to Vladivostok no military
alliances
independent economic trading block
moving towards some kind of social
democracy that's the Gorbachev vision
well that was alive
Putin's killed it
Not only was the invasion criminal but
it was also completely stupid from the
Russian point of view
he's handed the United States it's
fondest gift on a silver platter namely
Europe subordinate to the United States
no independent Force we run things
well that's part of the major change
that's taking place there's another
aspect to it though
the world doesn't go along with this
you read U.S propaganda it seems we're
fighting it
great moral
leadership doing wonderful things the
world doesn't see it that way
almost the entire Global South says None
of our business
a few Europeans want to fight each other
go ahead but and don't hand us this tale
about uh
humanitarianism and democracy we've been
at the wrong end of the guns for
hundreds of years we know what you're up
to you don't believe anything about
humanitarianism or law or democracy or
any of that sir
hundreds of years of experience so cut
the hypocrisy you want to have a proxy
war with Russia with you go ahead but
it's not our business if you look at
sanctions almost nobody participates
it's just Europe and the angler the
English-speaking countries in Japan
the rest of the world doesn't
participate in effect what they're doing
is what the one of the effects of the
war and the sanctions
is to
lead to the development of independent
Financial systems
so India
it's trade with Russia can be in rules
it's traded with China in
the Chinese currency
uh interesting development with the
oil producers Saudi Arabia United Arab
Emirates
they're moving towards independence from
U.S control
one of the strength of the dollar
for 50 years 60 years has been that it's
a Petra dollar
payments for oil or in dollars Saudi
Arabia UAE you have accepted that not
any longer they're starting to develop
independent relations with China it's
called a Petro Yuan and it's a
independent Financial system that Europe
has been strangled by the U.S financial
controls so for example when the U.S
pulled out of the uh
joint arrangements with uh Europe and
Iran on the Iranian nuclear programs
U.S pulled down and then imposed
sanctions on Iran
to punish Iran for the fact that the U.S
had pulled out of the agreement Europe
was strongly opposed they wanted to
maintain trade investment in Iran can't
do it
U.S sanctions or third-party sanctions
if you violate U.S sanctions you get
thrown out of the International
Financial system which is run out of New
York
well Europe went along with that but for
how long
most of the world isn't going along with
it anymore
there's a good deal of lying about this
in the western press you have to be
pretty careful so there's a lot of
euphoria in the western press a couple
months ago and a Prime Minister Modi of
India
expressed his opposition to the Russian
invasion of Ukraine this was published
all over the place and what actually
happened is
there was a meeting in summercond with
Modi and Putin and Modi started his
comments by saying war is not the way
that was highlighted all over the place
India is separating itself from Russia a
great wonderful thing well take the
trouble of one of the nice things about
the internet is you can look things up
so you can look up the Indian government
website
and see what Modi actually said
he did say war is not the way and then
he went on with a practically a love
letter to Putin saying our relations
have never been closer we're going to
work together to get a better world and
we're on the same side of everything and
so on all of that was cut out of Western
commentary just the first few words
well
it's pretty much the same when
the Russians sent a delegation to the
conference in Indonesia the
International Conference in Bali they
were welcomed
lover of foreign minister went and
others welcomed in Africa
it's not the world of the United States
sees
propaganda here is very careful that you
see only a particular picture of the
world which
uh Power Systems want you to see the
world is actually quite different
again the advantage of the internet is
if you want to you can look up foreign
services
together not Europe but you get a very
different picture
so the news has been dominated by the
Russian invasion it's uh all we talk
about in the Netherlands as well
um and the pandemic has gone to the
background
so if if we if you if you we take a look
at the United States has the pandemic
finished
is it over
pandemic is Raging in the United States
the United States is one of the world's
worst records in dealing with the
pandemic uh
it's kind of interesting to look at the
coverage
the it's China That's condemned for its
treatment of the pandemic
actually China the number of up until
recently the number of the total number
of deaths in China
is about maybe what you get in a week in
the United States
they've saved millions of lives but we
don't talk about that what we talk about
is the fact that the
current right now there is a problem in
China as the people are released from
the controlled system which saves
millions of lives and there hasn't been
adequate preparation for uh giving
enough vaccination and so on maybe
they'll take care of it maybe not but
their record up till now is incomparably
better than the United States
by comparative standards they would have
saved the equivalent of several Million
Lives
but China never gets any credit for that
of course because you have to show that
they're bad incidentally speaking of the
Netherlands uh it's not just the Ukraine
war
the U.S war against China
is having a very harmful effect on the
Netherlands
you Biden has
virtually declared war on China
now that's the way it's described in the
business press the United States must
use its economic power to prevent China
from developing
how by blocking uh advanced technology
like semiconductors U.S can use its
power and control to prevent Chinese
development
it's here that's that's considered
wonderful in the United States yes we
have to do that our task is that we
don't try to outdo China by doing better
ourselves we out do China by preventing
them from developing that's considered
very praiseworthy well where's the
Netherlands fit in you know this happens
to be one of the the main producer in
fact of high quality uh materials for
semiconductors and the U.S is Banning
the Netherlands from you sending them to
China
allowing China to use anything that has
American components in it and of course
the way Supply chains work everything
has an American component
maybe a patent or something that may
harm the Netherlands very seriously if
the Netherlands goes along with U.S
orders
as far as I know it's
hasn't been decided yet Japan is also
under the same pressures they've been
finding ways around it also South Korea
Samsung goes under those pressures
so the United States is trying to coerce
its allies
into declining economically
to support the U.S Ward to prevent China
from developing
that's a major effect in world affairs
how will the Netherlands react be
interesting to see
how will Germany react
when it's being de-industrialized
Germany had a very success the world's
most successful industrial system a
complex system ranging from Netherlands
to Slovakia
it's all collapsing are they going to
accept to be
de-industrialized as part of the U.S
effort to dominate the world
big question for Europe
Netherlands in particular but that's off
the topic it's not the pandemic well
exactly so I was wondering um you say
the pandemic is still raging in the
United States but and yet I believe all
the all the measures have been lifted
when you look around you you don't see
mouth masks anymore you don't have to
keep a three feet distance
so how how can you say there is still a
pandemic going on while all these
measurements and restrictions are lifted
the efforts to deal with it have
declined
and that's very serious not just the
fact that people walk around without
masks the funding has declined
you want to get a booster shot now you
got to pay for it
it's not given with you know
very low pay anymore
uh worse than that research has been cut
back
severely
I mean the vaccines were made available
very quickly and effectively because of
a lot of funding of research
and it's been withdrawn
every scientist knows there's going to
be more pandemics
and we're not preparing for them
because
funding for the kind of research that
might lead to more effective vaccines
maybe even the universal vaccine that's
been sharply cut back so we're planning
to ensure that there'll be much more
damage from coming coming pandemics but
that's common to you to Western U.S
policy across the board
there's also the much more serious than
the pandemic is the
crisis of
heating the atmosphere baking the planet
much more serious that's being cut back
in fact going into reverse
of course subsidies the fossil fuel
companies continue
but new federal
new fields are being open for
exploration
a lot of planning for long-term
investment Euphoria in fossil fuel
headquarters profits are going through
the roof and great opportunities for the
long-term development investment to
destroy the world as quickly as possible
which is what's happening
so this is capitalism run or cert coin
berserk I mean capitalism is based on
the principle that
Adam Smith called the vile Maxim
all for ourselves nothing for anyone
else and don't care what the hip effects
are
that's capitalism can be controlled it's
been somewhat controlled in past years
now it's lit free
and it means we destroy ourselves
take a look at
I think say the region where fossil
fuels are being produced the Eastern
Mediterranean region
take a look at the scientific
projections
display is really other
Regional scientists they're predicting
that in by the end of the century
temperatures will have risen 5 degrees
Celsius
and the sea level will have risen two to
two and a half meters
of the densely populated areas along the
sea what's that going to be go a little
bit north to Cyprus there's a war
Brewing between turkey and Greece
Syria's kind of War what's it about
pipelines and exploiting the resources
of the Eastern Mediterranean so let's
see how we can kill ourselves faster
uh pandemic is serious this is much more
serious
I'm in the leadership political
leadership of the world is on a race to
see how we can destroy ourselves as
quickly as possible
actually one of the few
sane voices now is the U.N Secretary of
General
Gutierrez just you might want to read
his
book a couple days ago at the world
economic Forum in Davis
pleading
have a little bit of Sanity you know
nobody listens
much better to make more money tomorrow
and who the hell here because what
happens
well that's uh the world we're living in
capitalism going insane
I have one last question uh Professor
Chomsky because um I want to be
respectful of your time uh you know you
have so many fans around the globe but
um since since last year you'll have
lost a couple of fans because
um well there appeared a video on
Twitter in which you talk about the
unvaccinated and some people blame you
for saying that the unvaccinated should
isolate themselves from society in order
to keep the harmful safe and now that
was in 2021 we're in 2022 now
um I was wondering uh have your uh um
are you still do you still have the same
opinion when it comes to the
unvaccinated because many of my
followers have been asking their
question
when I say exactly what I said then
the unvaccinated or people are perfectly
free to refuse vaccination shouldn't be
forced on them but then they have a
responsibility to act as decent human
beings
if others want to protect themselves
they should honor that right
if a hospital for example
or a restaurant or a meat packing plant
or whatever imposes restrictions saying
please don't come in here if you're not
vaccinated or masked the unvaccinated
have a responsibility
to honor that in that regard they should
isolate themselves
unless you regard the unvaccinated or
some privileged caste who is right to do
anything harm people if they feel they
could well you have to I think you
should agree with this so it's the same
position I had then well because some
people might say that there's a lot of
research by now and research will say
that even the vaccinated are still
capable of transmitting a virus to
another person and people still can get
ill they're certainly uh have a right to
believe that if they like
but if say a hospital
decides to follow the advice of a
hundred percent of medical journals
around the world
100 of a professional societies around
the world and impose a vaccination
constraint they have a right to do it
they don't have the need to follow your
opinion you can have your opinion
they're entitled to say we're going to
follow the advice of the scientific
Community almost universally
we have a right to do that you don't
like it too bad you don't want to put on
a mask go somewhere else
I think that's quite proper it's like
this as if somebody said look uh if you
look at the statistics uh there aren't
very many
deaths from people who go through red
lights
you know probably almost none so why
should I stop it originally it's an
infringement on my freedom
well
not the kind of society I would like to
live in
well hospital is of course an easy
example because there are many um
fragile people in hospital in danger of
being infected what about schools or a
playground take a restaurant
suppose people in a restaurant workers
in a restaurant and people who go to the
restaurant
want to be free from infection so they
have a masking requirement
I think that should be honored
pick a meat packing plant where men are
working together men and women are
working together under hideous
conditions right next to each other
there are meat packing plants which have
imposed masking and vaccination
requirements I think they should be
honored you can say I don't believe that
it's I'm infectious okay your fear to
not believe it but not to endanger
others
it because many people
um consider you a freedom fighter you
know you
you protect or you you try to advocate
for the for minorities and then it
causes some kind of cognitive dissonance
a Chomsky almost you know
[Music]
um
um tomsky not
um respecting this small minority that
doesn't want to be vaccinated and we've
been reading about you for so many years
it refused to be vaccinated anyone's
free to refuse yeah but you should have
the decency to allow others to protect
themselves
like following traffic laws yeah uh yeah
I do believe in Freedom from arbitrary
illegitimate Authority but aob traffic
laws I don't think that's illegitimate
yeah the thing is it's just it appears
uh to some that
um that the unvaccinated shouldn't be
taking part in society almost because
it's it's a pretty it can be all over
Society but they should not they should
observe requirements by groups that want
to follow the advice of in fact a
hundred percent of medical uh basic
medical authorities and say this is the
way I want to protect them so I don't
think the unvaccinated or a privileged
test
yeah
I think that's a really reasonable point
of view of Professor Chomsky and it
doesn't stop me this point of view from
respecting you for for all the work you
have done so you didn't lose me there I
I was just obliged to ask this question
for my followers so I would like to end
this interview again because it's it's
the third time you join my show thanks a
lot for doing that and um what's what's
your next book when is your next book
coming out
next book
not right you're not working on anything
right now yeah
another collection of
interviews and
articles with uh
follow-up from the book called The
precipice that was probably the next one
also some technical work coming out but
a language
well anyway uh Professor chumsky thanks
a lot for your time you've been really
generous and um well
I would like to thank you for all the
work you've done and for inspiring me
and all my readers and viewers and I
hope to read many more books and to see
many more of your videos and
presentations so Professor Chomsky
thanks a lot once again enjoy the rest
of your day
bye-bye
