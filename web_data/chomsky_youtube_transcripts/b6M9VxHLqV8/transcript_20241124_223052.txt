(upbeat music)
- [Noam] The population
is actually beginning
to participate instead of just
accepting the hammer blows.
- We're starting to
see people recognizing
the true power in techniques
like withholding their labor
or shutting down streets
during the racial
uprisings last year.
- It's a sign that the
one-sided class war
of the last 40 years
is becoming two-sided.
- It's all coming up in
the Laura Flanders Show,
We're talking at a
moment in history
when certain long-held
assertions about markets
and government and
our relationship to
the natural world
seem to be loosening their grip,
and the manufacturers
of consent,
as one of our guests
today dub them,
no longer seem to have control
over what everyday
people think and do.
Millions of workers
are refusing to work
or believe what authorities say.
Others are rising
up against the odds,
against racist police,
powerful sexist men,
and even border guards
on horseback with whips.
All at once it seems
that all sorts of things
that were once unthinkable
are now being
openly talked about.
Coming from different
backgrounds, contexts
and generations,
our guests, they
have this in common.
They demand that we think
differently about everything
from our nation's history
and its place in the world
to who can run for office
in America and win.
Some of those unthinkables,
like that last one,
are kind of exciting.
Others are terrifying,
like the thought
that the human race
just may be on a terminal brink.
To discuss this moment
in all its frightening
and exciting possibilities,
MIT Professor Emeritus,
author and public
intellectual, Noam Chomsky,
and the Democratic Congresswoman
from New York, Bronx Native,
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
If I'm not mistaken,
this is the first time
you two have actually met.
So do you have anything you
want to say to each other,
maybe Noam, start.
- Sort of met, virtually
met, that's a step forward.
I hope there'll be
an actual chance.
I've been greatly admiring
what you've been doing,
following it closely,
it's real pleasure to
be sort of with you.
- It's absolutely, I
think it's such an honor
and a culminating moment
to be able to engage
with the one and only
Professor Chomsky.
And I greatly look
forward to, you know,
us being able to move as a
society past this pandemic
so that we can engage in-person.
- I can't wait for
that, I hope I'm there.
Well, Noam, starting with you,
there's always
been, as you put it,
a kind of long list of
unthinkable thoughts in America.
And yet just today I read
in one of our newspapers
of record, the New York Times,
that workers have real power,
that the economy just might need
some sort of planning
and that just possibly
leaving so many things to
markets isn't the best idea,
especially when it comes
to the environment,
healthcare, you name it.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Is something shifting?
- Well, we should,
first of all, recognize
that we've been living
through about 45 years
of a particular socio-economic
political system,
what's called neoliberalism.
Neoliberalism has a
formal definition,
pretty much what you said,
reliance on markets and so on.
That's almost total fraud.
That's not neoliberalism.
It was never a
reliance on markets.
The so-called free
trade agreements
or radically protectionist that
we're seeing that right now
in front of our eyes, we see
virtual monopoly on drugs.
The, what we've really
had for the 45 years
is what so many economists
have called a bail out economy.
So it's one side of class
war, markets for the poor,
protection for the rich.
- But now we talk about it,
and it does seem to me
there's been a shift.
And I wanna come
to you on this AOC,
I, you know, have
interviewed you before.
And that was when you would
just running for office
for a panel about young
people in politics
for an indication of
how much has changed
in terms of what's possible.
I recall with my
chagrin that even I,
a confirmed optoholic
ended that interview
saying well,
but if you don't win this
time, will you run again?
I thought it likely that
you might not be victorious
against powerful Joe
Crowley that first time.
But you were, and
you're not alone.
Has a dam broken, do you think?
- I do think that there
is a dam breaking,
both in electoral politics,
but also in organizing
beyond our electoral system.
Like what we're seeing with
the precipitation of strikes
on a scale that really has
not been seen in many years.
And I think it's a bit of
an emperor with no clothes
type of situation for our
political establishment
and our capitalist systems
where people are
beginning to realize
that once we name these
systems and describe them,
that this water that they are,
that people have been swimming
in actually has a name.
And there is alternatives that
people can come up for air
if we try to explore alternative
ways of doing things.
And I think that, you
know, after I won,
there was such a large
concerted attempt,
and continues to be a
large-concerted attempt by media
to marginalize, not
just my victory,
but what happened
in our community.
This was a fluke,
it was a, I mean,
you have the former governor
of New York, Andrew Cuomo,
within days saying this
was a complete accident.
You had every, every
major of elected official
and Democratic Party member
trying to dismiss what happened.
And the thing is
that it didn't stop.
There would be a case for
that if I was the only victory
that occurred.
But the fact of the
matter is is that simply
wasn't the case that
had the election
'cause people also
naming systems
and talking about
what was previously
extraordinarily
politically taboo.
- Very much, it's a sign
that the one-sided class war
of the last 40 years
is becoming two-sided.
The population is actually
beginning to participate
instead of just accepting
the hammer blows.
We now are having a huge strike.
One of the major strikes
in American history,
when workers are simply saying,
we're not gonna go back to
the rotten, oppressive jobs,
precarious, broadens
circumstances is novel,
we're just not gonna accept it.
And that's a major factor
in the economy now.
And yes, it's a strike
and it's showing up
in other ways too, there are,
for example, the teacher's
strikes were quite important.
These are non-unionized
red states,
tremendous popular support.
When you live in Arizona,
where one of them was
signs on every lawn,
supporting the teachers, not
a radical state by any means.
They were not just
calling for better wages,
which they greatly deserve,
but for saving the children,
saving the public
school, public education,
which has been under
severe attack for 45 years.
- The same is happening
in healthcare,
in your constituency and across
the country, Congresswoman,
what are you seeing
on that front?
And what do you think
is gonna come of this?
Because I have to say, you
know, industrial unions
came out of
industrial economies.
Today we have this kind of
Bezos economy, Amazon economy
and service economies that
aren't organized, most of them,
in the same way.
- What is so intertwined
in this discussion
is that this is not just
also about open critiques
of capitalism, but also open
critiques of white supremacy.
And it's in greater
understanding of
white supremacy,
not as just, you
know, these social,
these racist, social clubs
of people dawning hoods,
but actually as a system
and a systems understanding
of how white supremacy
has interacted
with the development
of the United States.
And so the way that
that ties back in
is that so many of these
essential labor forces
are dominated by women
and women of color,
whether it's fast food
workers or whether it's nurses
or whether it's childcare
and teaching professions,
this what, I would say
this capitalist class
calls a labor shortage,
in what is actually a
dignified work shortage,
is concentrated overwhelmingly
in working class people,
a multi-racial working class,
but also in professions
that are dominated
by women and women of color.
And so when we really
intertwined our understanding
of both of these systems,
that presents to us and
illuminates a lot of,
not just the problems that are
happening, but the solutions.
- Noam, when I came
in to talking with you
in the early '90s,
there was a miserable
and acrimonious backlash,
even on the left,
against what was then dismissed
as annoying identity politics.
What I'm hearing
now in every corner
is that people are getting it,
as the Congresswoman just said,
unless we address the power
of white male supremacy,
we're not gonna get the
changes that we need.
Do you agree there's been
a shift on that front?
- We should recognize
that white male supremacy
is a deep current
in American history.
It's not gonna go
away immediately.
But there have been
dents, significant ones.
So for example, even
in the mainstream,
when the New York Times
ran the 1619 project,
it couldn't have happened
a couple of years earlier.
And it's because of changes
in general consciousness
and awareness.
Of course, there was
an immediate backlash,
strong backlash,
and you're gonna expect
that, white male supremacy
is a deep part of American
history and culture.
So extirpated, it's
not gonna be easy.
And, but there are, there's
very significant progress,
and plenty of conflict coming.
It's not gonna be
an easy struggle.
- Well, both of you
are very focused
on that other uneasy struggle,
and that is the struggle for
survival of the human race
on the planet.
And I don't think I'm
putting it to grimly.
AOC, your first
piece of legislation
was that green, new
deal resolution,
which imagined a kind of
10-year national mobilization,
we are a few years
into that 10 years.
Your latest book Noam,
is called "The
Precipice Neoliberalism:
"The Pandemic and the
Urgent Need for Change."
Are we still at a point
where we can avoid
going over that precipice, Noam?
Is it too late?
- It's getting close.
We have just been, I should say,
that Congresswoman sees
resolution recently reintroduced
is absolutely
essential for survival,
but actually like to
know what you think,
the prospects are for
moving it forward.
Either something like that
resolution will be implemented,
but we're doomed.
It's that simple.
- To ask your question of AOC,
what are the chances
we can get real change?
I wanna say in our lifetime,
but we actually need it
much, much sooner than that.
- It is still a resolution
in and of itself,
is a statement of the
sense of Congress.
It does not formally bind us,
but what is
incredibly encouraging
is the mass adoption
of this blueprint.
And so once it was
released and submitted
to the House of Representatives
and publicly available,
we started to see movements
across the United States
that were not covered by media,
but municipalities and
states across the country
started to adopt these
targets on municipal levels.
You know, what I think though,
is that we can't underestimate
what we are standing up against.
We know, and there's a popular
sense and understanding
that so much of Congress
is captured by big money,
dark money, Wall Street
and special interests.
But what I don't think
is as quite understood
is that this money is oil
money that fuels Wall Street
that captures Congress.
But what is also, you know,
what is so important to
recognize is that our systems
and our avenues for action
are not just limited
to electoralism
and when we engage,
when we engage as far as we can
to the limits of electoralism,
then we also reengage
in our capacities
outside of our electoral system,
whether it's the
withholding of labor
or other sorts of
grassroots actions,
because there is also a
point of collective action
that becomes too difficult for
the ruling class to ignore,
because it then starts to
threaten their legitimacy.
- Let me ask you, Noam,
to come in on this.
I mean, where does that
radical change come from,
given the capture that
the Congresswoman's
described so well, and as
you have over the decade.
- The main part of politics
is activism and mobilization.
What happens in Congress
is pill reflection,
but it is a reflection.
The fact that
mobilization and activism,
are the core of politics,
there's very dramatic
examples of that,
but she was too modest to
mention, so I'll mention it.
The Sunrise Movement
is one of the,
at the forefront of
activism on climate.
They got the point of
civil disobedience,
occupying congressional offices,
occupying Nancy Pelosi's office,
demanding change or narrowly,
they'd just be thrown out
by the Capitol police.
They weren't this time because
one person from Congress
came and joined them.
AOC came to join them.
They weren't thrown
out, moved on,
that's what led to
Biden's climate program.
Not great, but better
than anything before.
Well, that's an illustration
of the point she was making.
Popular activism interacting
with supportive people
in Congress tend
to lead to results.
And this is an old
lesson we should learn.
It takes a new deal,
which greatly improved a lot of
of flaws,
greatly improved
American society.
How did it come about?
Hand-built by a combination
of militant labor action,
CIO organizing, sit down strikes
and a sympathetic
administration.
That combination is crucial.
- AOC, you did that action
that Noam just described
in the first moments off
to your election victory.
And you've sometimes said
that part of your job
is to retain that sense of
outsiderism and freshness.
How would you say you're
doing on that front?
And what is your
vision at this point
of the progressive agenda?
- What we experienced at
the beginning of this month
was a real transformative event
in the history of the
progressive caucus
within Congress,
where for the first two
years that I was in office,
it was essentially myself and
three other Congresswomen.
Maybe, maybe we could
get five others.
And we have the numbers
of maybe 10 people
in the last Congress to be
able to break with the party,
and this most recent fight,
the progressive caucus,
which is 95 members
out of the 218 needed
to pass any legislation,
galvanized and they were
willing to withhold their vote
in order to ensure
that the package
with the greatest amount of
benefits for most people,
from labor,
healthcare, childcare,
educational, protections
to climate was prioritized.
And I think that came
as a shock to the party.
It came as a shock
to mass media.
They didn't know
how to cover it.
- I wanna just end by asking
you to talk about your vision
for the future, Noam,
and what leads you
to think we can get there.
- Started in the 1930s, I'm
old enough to remember it,
my family was
first-generation immigrants,
working class, mostly
unemployed, very hopeful.
It's not like now.
Much, in absolute terms,
much worse than now,
but in psychological
terms for a different,
there was a sense that
we're working together
we can get out of this
rotten conditions.
But we're together, we have
the ability, labor action,
we have political organizations,
we have our groups,
associations working together
with somewhat sympathetic
administration,
we can get together and
fight our way out of this.
And they were right, they could,
not everything, but
a lot of progress
that happens right
throughout history.
And take around 1960,
couple of black kids
sat in a lunch counter in
Greensboro, North Carolina,
segregated lunch
counter, of course,
immediately arrested
and thrown out.
Could have been the end,
except the next day,
a couple more came back.
Pretty soon you had two
people coming from the north
to join them.
Pretty soon, you
had Snick workers
driving in freedom
buses through the south,
trying to encourage
a black farmer
to take his life in his hands
and go to register to vote.
Pretty soon you had
a huge movement.
Always likes it.
It's the people, you don't
even know their names.
Who knows their names, nobody.
But they're the people
who make things happen
and are the inspiration.
Actually my old
friend, Howard Zinn
formulated this nicely.
He said, we should
really honor the unknown,
the countless unknown people
whose work lays the basis
that ultimately enter history.
They're the ones
who are inspiring.
And they're the ones that
we should honor and respect.
- AOC, your vision, your
sense that it's possible.
- You know, there's this,
there's the writing
by Arundhati Roy,
which is that another
world is not only possible,
but it is already here.
And finding the pockets
where this world has arrived,
is what gives me hope.
The Bronx has one of the
highest per capita rates
of worker cooperatives
in the world.
That is a new economy in our
borough of millions of people.
And so whether it's that,
whether it is discussions
around mass incarceration,
abolitionists organizing,
not just, you know, what does
it mean to dismantle the jail,
but what does it mean to
reorganize the society
so that we do not have people
engaged in antisocial
behavior on such a scale
that we have today,
or that we don't have
antisocial systems.
You know, that these are not
just theoretical conversations
that people are having,
but there are communities
that are actively experimenting
and developing solutions.
And so to me, I
think what I work on
is not how do we find solutions,
but how do we
scale the solutions
that we've already developed
to transform our society.
And that is work that breaks
our cycles of cynicism.
Cynicism, I think is a far
greater enemy to the left
than many others,
because it is the tool
that is given to us
to hurt ourselves.
And hope creates action
and action creates hope.
And that's how we scale forward.
- Well, I think it was
Arundhati that said, as you say,
the nother world is
not only possible,
it's happening on a quiet
day, I think she said,
you can hear her breathing.
And in this conversation,
I've definitely
heard her breathing.
We will continue to
report those stories
that fly in the
face of cynicism.
I thank you both for
your lifelong commitment
to acting in ways that
defy that cynicism,
and appreciate that you
chose to spend the hour
with each other and with us
at the Laura Flanders Show.
Huge appreciation to you.
- And I'm just eternally
grateful to both of you
for taking the time.
And I so sincerely
appreciate it,
Professor Chomsky,
of course, and Laura,
thank you so very, very much.
(whooshing sound)
- Like water to a
fish, the status quo
is just the way things are
until someone names
there's system among many
and suggests we have choice.
Choice is part of what
AOC and Noam Chomsky
have been talking
about for a while.
We can think of thinkable
thoughts, they say,
and they have, just as we
thought the unthinkable,
that we could bring the
two of them together
in a single conversation.
Well, we did it.
And the rest of the conversation
isn't on the editing room floor.
The full uncut version
is in our archives.
You can check it out.
Hear how AOC cast vote
that made her cry.
Here what Chomsky believes
has changed and hasn't
about the Democratic Party.
You can find that and
more in our archives,
which are made possible,
in part, by our
viewers and listeners.
So thank you.
'Till the next time,
stay kind, stay curious.
