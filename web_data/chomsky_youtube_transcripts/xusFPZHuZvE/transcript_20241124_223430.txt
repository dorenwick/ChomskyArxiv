back in the
1950s uh President Eisenhower was
concerned about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world not among the governments who
more or less okay but among the
people uh and this is a secret then it's
been Declassified since the National
Security Council major planning agency
uh issued a a memorandum on this issue
it uh stated that uh there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports D harsh and
brutal dictatorships and that the US
blocks democracy and development and we
do it because we want to control their
resources and I went on to say that the
perception is more or less accurate and
furthermore that's what we ought to be
doing uh as as long as the population's
quiet it doesn't matter the dictators
support us so everything's fine that's
1958 uh 2001 defense science board
essentially came up with the same
conclusion uh the same conclusion holds
this today it was strikingly Illustrated
in the Wikileaks Revelations uh one of
the the ones that got the most publicity
big headlines euphoric commentary were
the revelations in C
that the Arabs support us policy towards
Iran that's really important uh one
slight flaw in those reports they were
referring to the Arab
dictators they allegedly support our
policies towards Iran what about the
Arab population well we know their
feelings there are major polls taken by
the US the leading us polling agencies
uh released by prestigious institutions
Brooking institutions
not reported in the United States
incidentally as far as I know one report
in England Jonathan steel had an article
in the guardian about it I think that's
the only one uh they're interesting they
say that uh there are indeed Arabs who
support US policies on Iran about 10%
think that Iran is a
threat um overwhelmingly they regard the
United States and Israel as the major
threats Egypt 90% regard the United
States as the major threat in fact
opposition to US policies is so strong
uh that a majority favor say the region
would be better off if Iran had nuclear
weapons um almost 80% in Egypt high
percentage in the rest of the region
well that won't do again for the usual
reasons uh this so therefore this is
totally almost totally suppressed as far
as I know steel is the only report in
the English-speaking World outside of
critical you I write about it other
people in the margins right about it but
uh the uh uh what the reactions reveal
once again the simply extreme contempt
for democracy as long as the dictators
back us it really doesn't matter what
the population thinks if there's a
campaign of hatred against us among the
population and the dictators are in
control everything's fine euphoric
headlines uh that was
1958 2001 today it's it's standard in
the case of Britain it goes back much
earlier it goes back you century and a
half two centuries the US it's standard
since the US replaced Britain AS Global
hedgemon and France is the same if not
worse in fact every great power acts
pretty much the same same way uh well
you know these are things in the
background of terrorism you have to pay
attention to them we also know pretty
well how to deal with terrorism in fact
Britain um led the way in this case in
in Northern Ireland terrorism was pretty
serious the IRA Terror British Terror
was even worse of course but that's the
usual balance of forces uh but Ira
Terror was not a joke uh as long as
Britain reacted to it with greater
Terror the cycle of terrorism increased
and finally uh last in the 9s U Britain
finally responded with us pressure in
this case uh in a sensible way they
tried to pay attention to the Grievances
that lay behind the terror there were
grievances real ones uh Britain started
to pay attention to the the
Grievances Terror
reduced people who had been involved you
know Ira Hitman were brought into
negotiations some of them now ended up
in the government it's not Utopia but
it's a big difference from what it was
before I was actually in Belfast in 1993
and it was like a war zone I was back
last year and it's peaceful you know
there's tensions but the kind of
tensions that in every city I I I
couldn't see them but people told me you
know this is a Protestant neighborhood
if you're Catholic you don't go into it
and that sort of thing but U uh but it
certainly wasn't what it was in 1993
okay that's the way to deal with Terror
let take a look at its causes and its
sources if you want to reduce it but um
States uh do not
consider uh Terror a major problem it's
that's true of Britain in the United
States for example this came out in the
chilcott hearings clearly the head of
British intelligence testified that when
the US and Britain invaded Iraq they
both anticipated that it would increase
Terror actually it did a lot more than
anyone expected increased it by about a
factor of seven but they both
anticipated it was going to increase
Terror but there other purposes there
higher priorities than U uh
protecting the domestic populations so
they went to war and that's not unusual
there were time go over many more
examples uh anyhow I think these are
some of the things that should be kept
in mind and thinking about the return to
barbarism in our time you know the
plague of terrorism in our age and so
on
