already gentlemen and we are rolling
okay the uh first question about
Palestine or the issue of Palestine is
the new uh uh Observer State uh if you
can tell us about your thoughts um the
voting and um the um uh indications and
how important it
is I think it was a useful step forward
but
uh uh we should now speak of occupied
Palestine not the occupied
territories uh of course the
significance of a a general assembly
resolution depends on the willingness of
the great powers in particular the
United States to permit it to be
implemented uh other than
that resolutions have no consequences
uh and in this case uh the US of course
voted against it uh it uh has already uh
punished the United Nations for even
moving in that direction by defunding
UNESCO not for the first time uh Israel
of course uh right away announced that
it would punish the Palestinians for
pursuing this course and proceeded to do
so with new settl to settlement plans
other
devices uh theoretically Palestine now
has the option of approaching the
international criminal court with
charges against Israel for criminal acts
in and occupied what's now occupied
Palestine but again the chances of
success depend very heavily in fact
overwhelmingly on whether the US will
permit anything to proceed and that's
unlikely might be educational and useful
to try in any anyhow but uh we should
recognize that this is not a world ruled
by law it's a world ruled by force with
some legal veneer which is used
occasionally uh often used against the
weak and defenseless the international
criminal court and the ha tribunals are
a good example they don't uh bring to
justice major criminals leading war
criminals from the West they are used
selectively against enemies of the west
or
defenseless uh individuals who may well
be May well be that the crimes they
sense that are Justified but they're
highly selected uh this applies
generally for
example well in the domain of
international
law the United States
uh declared back in 1946 when it
initiated the uh establishment of the
international court of justice that the
United States would not be subject
to uh any charges
for violation of international law
meaning the UN Charter organization
American states and so on and the courts
have abided by that if the case brought
by Yugoslavia against
NATO uh where one of the charges was
genocide the
US Exempted itself from the case on the
grounds that when the US signed the
genocide convention mention about 4
years after it was
introduced it haded a reservation saying
that it does not apply to the United
States and the court following its rules
in fact therefore excused the United
States from the procedings proceeded
against the other powers and their other
cases so international law
is is something that should be honored
and defended but without illusions uh in
in this
case the establishment of a Palestinian
state with Observer status uh should be
uh used to whatever extent possible to
extend human rights and justice but it's
not where the action
is do you think that uh uh BDS movement
with uh you know in general what are
your thoughts uh you think it could
supplement that process in
accelerated the phrase I think the
tactics beds tactics are very good
tactics but I'm always a little put off
by the phrase BDS movement so for
example in the case of South Africa
which is the model there was no BDS
movement there was a selective use of
BDS tactics uh adapted to circumstances
and design so that they would be
effective and that's the right way to
proceed uh but uh soon as we start
talking about BDS movement that
immediately calls to mind fixed
principles an authority that determines
how the movement acts and so on and that
could be harmful and in fact sometimes
has been uh usage of the BDS tactics has
sometimes been quite effective effective
sometimes it's been harmful because it
did not take into account uh the
circumstances the audience the effect on
the audience or in fact has turned out
to be harmful so the tactics are are are
very sensible and they're not restricted
to the so-called BDS movement so for
example I was involved in BDS activities
years before the movement was ever
started and so were others uh the major
human rights
organizations have also
advocated use of these tactics but
they're not considered part of the BDS
movement so for example Human Rights
Watch the major one has called on
corporations us
corporations to refrain from any actions
which would support uh settlement
activities the settlements are all
illegal it's not in doubt and they recog
recognize that and I've also called on
the US government not to participate in
uh what in fact are criminal acts
supporting the settlements uh those
responsibilities extend to individuals
as well and they can meet these
responsibilities by making use of BDS
tactics when appropriate well
design Cy allow me to move into uh the
Arab Spring in general and specifically
to the Arab monarchs uh uh social
movement is kind of restrained by many
factors uh me being a Saudi originally
uh one of the uh things that that that
we see is U the first thing is the
synchronization between the religion the
power the big business second thing the
working class is um almost entirely
important uh who do you think that the
uh responsibility of social change in
such under such circumstances
well the responsibility is different for
different actors for the sui regime the
responsibility would be to end
repressive tactics and uh
Foster uh social justice and freedom
well they're not going to do that on
their own for uh Outsiders like say the
Western Powers the responsibility would
be
to uh OPP ose in whatever way they can
the use of the kinds of measures you
described certainly not to support them
and of course they're doing the opposite
they're
supporting uh the repression in Saudi
Arabia has occasionally been pretty
harsh particularly in the Shiite regions
along the gulf and there's no protest
from the Western Powers they continue to
in effect support them
diplomatically military uh dispatch of
military uh means and so on and so forth
in the case of
bahin there was a little media attention
but not that much and in fact the US and
its allies continue to support the
crushing of the effort to move towards
reform in Saudi Arabia there was a weak
attempt to join the Arab Spring with a
Friday
day of Rage type demonstration but
security presence was so overwhelming I
don't think people even went out into
the streets uh the uh in the cases where
the Arab Spring has made some progress
primarily Tunisia and Egypt one critical
Factor was the participation of the
labor movement both countries have a
history of Labor activism and militancy
crushed by by the dictatorship often but
uh nevertheless they're growing and when
they joined uh in the U demonstrations
and so on that made a big difference and
in fact one of the achievements of the
Arab Spring so far there are real
achievements that they're limited has
been to open up new possibilities for
independent labor organizing now there
in Egypt for example after the overthrow
of the Mubarak
dictatorship there have been a
substantial number of Labor actions some
of them pretty significant and there
have been the first serious steps
towards forming an independent labor
union independent of the government run
you know pseudo Union well those are all
important developments now as you say
that it's not going to happen in Saudi
Arabia unless the labor movement is free
but when the labor movement is imported
they have no rights and they're harshly
repressed they can't possibly begin to
act in their own interest and that
should be overcome uh to grant grant the
labor rights
that do fall
under International labor organization
principle and other uh and other uh
means of organizing an
activism uh that's a long haul the
religious controls in Saudi Arabia are
enormous of course Saudi Arabia
is the most extreme fundamentalist state
in the world furthermore it exports its
fundamentalism it's a missionary State
the uh and it's had a pernicious effect
elsewhere so in Pakistan for example
under the Z hu dictatorship
uh Saudi money poured in to
establish extremely reactionary
religious schools many of the
madrasas
which have had a very harmful effect on
Pakistan
and radical islamization of it and
undermining its own democracy and
freedom and I in the the countries of
where the Arab Spring has had some
progress Egypt and Tunisia the
Apparently SOI money is again pouring in
to support the most
extreme uh radical islamist groups
salafis and all of this is I think very
harmful to the as well as just the
preaching of the fundamentalist religion
but quite over over and above applying
it often applying it quite brutally
within Saudi Arabia so these are all
serious problems that should be overcome
and one reason why it's hard to overcome
them is they're supported by the Western
powers in fact
traditionally uh Britain first Britain
then the United States have attended to
support uh Islamic fundamentalist
extremism uh in opposition to secular
nationalism that's a traditional
patterns you can understand that secular
nationalism is what threatened the
control of the western Powers
over uh uh oil production which is what
they're most on distribution which is
what they're most interested in and
always carried with it the threat that
the energy resources of the region would
be directed to the needs of the people
of the region and not to enriching
Western
corporations domestic
Elite uh strengthening Western powers in
their
no strategic power over the world this
is sort of you know it's oversimplified
but that's been the major tendency and
as long as that as long as citizens of
the West permit their own governments to
act that way and they don't have to then
it's going to be quite hard to carry
out
reformist liberating efforts in the Gulf
dictatorships not just Saudi Arabia can
if you allow me one last question uh is
this one of the things that I growing up
tend to think about and uh and I I I
basically compared it to the situation
of r with the financial Evolution for
example importing labor it was for a
long time growing up it was actually a
source of Pride that our people
don't those kind of jobs but do you
think such plans as this is is is
consciously
objective uh based
on topal domination eliminating
revolutions as
such I can't penetrate the thinking of
the sui Elite or the GCC Elite but I
presume that they just see it as a part
of their privilege they
are the beneficiaries of enormous uh
resources uh they uh regard themselves
as the just rulers on religious and
other grounds and uh therefore they uh
bring in what amount to surfs routinely
just as feudal Nobles do without any
particular ideology behind it it's our
right we're rich we're powerful uh
they're powerless and impoverished we'll
do with them what we
like that's pretty much the same in
other countries so take say Israel which
is not a religious feudal state but they
uh Israeli economy depends significantly
on imported labor which in Israel is
sometimes even essentially called slave
labor Israel has it used to exploit
Palestinians for these purposes but uh
after decided to rid itself of the
Palestinians it's essentially
been surviving on the wreckage of
international neoliberal
policies which leave great masses of
people suffering and hopeless throughout
the world and they can
become kind of slave labor force like
undocumented immigrants in the United
States U but that's unfortunately ly
very common practice for the golf
dictatorships it's almost my second
age
