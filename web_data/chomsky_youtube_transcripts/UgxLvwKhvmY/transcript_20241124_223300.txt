Professor Chomsky what a pleasure to
have you today I'd like to talk to you
about two things because you're an icon
of free speech and of criticism of US
foreign policy both are very interesting
to me let's talk about Free Speech the
left used to be associated with free
speech does the left care about Free
Speech now as much as they did in the
60s and
70s well there are U
the the struggle for free speech in the
60s and the 70s was an effort to break
through constraints against what could
be articulated and what people could
hear actually the notion of freedom of
speech is uh not so trivial so take say
the First Amendment of the Constitution
it's doesn't really say very much but
the way it's been interpreted over the
years there are two Dimensions to it one
is the freedom to from a government
constraint notice that not freedom from
corporate constraint which is very
severe can give examples but freedom
from government constraint the other
dimension is the uh freedom
to obtain information and to express
oneself now that's different uh and in
fact if you look at at the uh Universal
Declaration of Human Rights uh of the
United Nations the article I think it's
Article 19 that's concerned with this
speaks of the freedom to impart and
receive information now if you go back
to the early history of the United
States the founding fathers were
concerned with both rights so the state
policies things like uh postal rules and
others were designed to permit the
freest possible imparting of information
expression of opinion but also of
receiving information well Professor I I
want to go back to the the thing you
said at first which was that uh in the
60s and 70s it was about breaking
through and especially about protesting
the Vietnam War and other social change
Civil Right movements for
African-Americans but I want to follow
up on that because it seems to me that
now that the 60s leftists have broken
through have taken over the Deans
offices and the highest political
offices a 60s activist Community
organizer is now the president or at
least in the mold of a 60s activist is
that why today's leftists are the
enforcers of speech codes whereas in the
60s they were Pro protesting outside the
Dean's office now they're the ones with
the politically correct speech codes cuz
they got their way so they don't need
the tool of free speech anymore it was
just a temporary weapon to smash the
conservative
hegemony I don't think that's true at
all the constraints on uh breaking
through to the public are probably
greater than they were in this at least
comparable to what they were in the 60s
but where are the leftist free speech
activists today aren't they now the
enforcers of political correctness on uh
conservative ideas on gender or sexual
orientation aren't there more speech
codes being enforced by leftists now
than ever before uh that's a dramatic
exaggeration okay well how big a problem
restrictions on uh freedom of expression
and uh come uh from the uh corporate
sector uh the state sector and they're
very they're pretty rigid so nothing
prevents me from saying in the United
States that uh the Iraq War was the
worst crime in the 21st century but I
can't publish I can't I can only reach
uh very marginal audiences on what is a
pretty obvious fact there are very you
can say in the United States within the
mainstream that the Iraq War was a
strategic blunder as Obama did but try
saying that it's a a crime of aggression
of the kind that uh led to the hanging
of Nazi war criminals at nurmberg try to
write an opit about that but but you're
but aren't you confusing things
Professor aren't you saying my power to
force someone else to carry My Views is
a res my lack of that power to make ABC
CBS NBC carry My Views is a form of
censorship isn't that that's not
censorship that's their right to be free
from your views whereas if you said
certain things on campus about sexuality
about women's uh women or or minorities
you would would just face a lack of
media that would carry your views you
would face student misconduct hearings
you would be expelled you would be uh
drummed out of Institutions I'm not
talking about someone refusing to print
your aads I'm talking about someone
proactively gagging you it is a very
marginal phenomenon on campus which
barely exists but there's a major
phenomenon and that is the virtual
monopolization of the major media by
private corporate what about the
internet I mean you're huge on the
internet you can go around them may I
continue please do radically restricts
the opportunity for freedom of for
expressing opinion and providing
information it's true that you can get
around it in uh peripheral ways but this
is an enormous constraint on freedom of
speech I I can give you let me give you
an example of one of the cases that's
not regarded interestingly as constraint
on freedom of speech uh I've published
number of books with a colleague Edward
Herman of Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania the first
book we published uh was uh published by
a small but
profitable uh textbook publisher it was
called counterrevolutionary violence the
uh they published 20,000 copies of it uh
the uh advertisements for it reached the
conglom the one of the executives in the
big
conglomerate Warner Communications now
part of Warner Brothers that uh uh own
the the publisher he didn't like it he
ordered the publisher to uh not to
distribute the book when they refused uh
he put the entire publisher out of
business uh destroying all of their
stock is that a constraint on freedom of
speech yeah but it's not considered that
because it's not State censorship well
Professor I mean you talked about 20,000
copies of a book I predict our
discussion here will have more than
20,000 views I mean I I I think you're
disregarding the Democrat
democratization of of the internet that
allows anyone with a blog or a YouTube
page or even a Facebook page to talk to
literally millions do you discount that
no of course I don't discount it in fact
I've written about it but it Remains the
case that
overwhelmingly the media that reach the
general public are under corporate
control and highly restrictive are you
not a a a form of a celebrity are you
not a star I if I thought of the top 10
academics in terms of their reach and
the passionate following they have
despite this corporate uh uh you know
embargo that you refer to I would put it
to you that you've been enormously
successful your ideas have found great
purchase aren't you a living disproof of
your theory not at all in fact it has
nothing to do with me it's quite General
ener uh I mentioned one example
describing accurately the Iraq War
virtually impossible in the major U
sources of information in the United
States same with the Vietnam War I mean
you mentioned the Vietnam War before did
the left win that I mean is it possible
to point out in the major media and if
if so please tell me where that uh the
United that under John F Kennedy the
United States invaded South Vietnam
uh carried out a major Act of aggression
uh which then expanded to the point
where it destroyed virtually all of
Indochina in the worst crime since the
second world war tell me where you've
seen the phrase invasion of South
Vietnam in the mainstream media I I
think that most movies about war both in
the Vietnam era and certainly in the
Iraq era uh I mean there's American
Sniper on the one hand but I could name
you 10 10 anti-war fil but can I shift
gears because you you brought up Foreign
Affairs and I'd like to to Plum your
views on that may I ask you about
Foreign Affairs and and your thoughts on
the Obama Administration there's a man I
would say of the left not just the
liberal but of the left do you generally
approve or disapprove of Obama's Foreign
Affairs conduct uh Obama is a man of the
u center right he's not that's called
the left in the United States but that's
an indication of the narrowness of the
spectrum under Obama if you look at
Global opinion uh which doesn't get
published here but it's real uh so
Gallop polles of international opinion
you find that uh the United States the
one of the questions it's asked is which
country in the world is the greatest
threat to World Peace the United States
is in the lead by a no one else is even
close way behind in second place is
Pakistan others who are regarded here as
the major threats are barely mentioned
well surely the Islamic State and Boko
Haram and Al-Qaeda do you think that um
Barack Obama and the United States are a
greater threat to peace than these
Muslim terrorist groups I've just listed
you didn't ask I didn't say I didn't
give you my opinion okay I'm sorry go
ahead I gave you Global opinion okay
Global opinion as taken by the gallop
organization the main poing organization
as far as I'm aware that wasn't even
published here but it's a significant
fact and if you look at the reasons
there our reasons so for example uh take
President Obama's Global assassination
campaign the Drone campaign it is a
campaign which openly not secretly
targets people who are suspected of
perhaps intending someday to do harm to
us can you imagine if uh say Iran was
carrying out a global campaign to
assassinate people who thought might be
of harm to them I mean we'd probably
nuke them but when we do it it's fine
and it's called and you call it
left I I take your point are there any
political uh leaders in the United
States that come close to expressing
your views on on foreign policy or are
all of the major parties baraff of such
people oh no they have them I mean
they're and in fact they range all over
the Spectrum so there have been times
when say Bernie sand ERS expressed views
very close to mine on foreign policy
there are times when ran fall
did let me ask you about uh the United
States I know you're a strong critic of
uh the war on terror you discussed your
opposition to to droning and and I think
that you have been a leading critic of
the United States foreign policy for
many years but I want to bring you back
to this Muslim terrorism I referred to
earlier the Islamic State boo Haram
Al-Qaeda al-shabab there's too many to
list at what point does your criticism
of the United States however valid it
may be seem
disproportionate given the threat of
what I and some others regard as the new
Nazism of these Islamic fascist
theocracies we've all seen the beheading
videos and Horrors that are reminiscent
of the Nazis at what point does it seem
to
exquisitly uh you know
uh that you're making the perfect the
enemy of the good that you may have a uh
criticism of the United States but it
seems trivial to the threat that posed
by radical Islam do you feel out of
balance that you should criticize
perhaps America's enemies more no I
think the opposite uh it's first of all
it's always let's take say the uh let's
take Iran okay uh the the duty of an
Iranian dissident inside Iran is not to
join the huge chorus of condemnation of
the crimes of Israel in the United
States the crimes are very real the duty
of a honest disident an honest uh
honorable person in Iran would be to
criticize the crimes of Iran and we
understand that in the old Soviet Union
we respected the dissidence sakarov and
others because of their criticism of the
crimes uh
repression violence of their own country
we didn't care what they said about the
US war in Vietnam that's none of their
they in fact if they supported it who
cared uh we honored them for doing what
they had to do within their own
countries same with VAV hav we honor him
because we uh because of his uh uh
struggle his courageous struggle against
repression and violence where he was uh
whether the fact is that he did support
us crimes but that's marginal do you
regard yourself as a diss Cas is quite
different are you a dissident Professor
do I disagree with uh what what does a
dissident mean I don't know you've been
using the term I I that's an interesting
term we use the term the term
conventionally is used in the United
States only for critics in enemy States
we don't call critics in the United
States or allies disant that's part of a
propaganda system what would you call
yourself the person who gives my opinion
about International domestic affairs
well but but there's a flavor to your
opinion Happ to be it happens to be the
kind of criticism which we call
dissidence in enemy States so therefore
we should call that here too not accept
the propaganda uh device of restricting
it to enemies we should apply it to
ourselves as well now going to continue
I'm not comparable to the dissidents in
the Soviet Union Iran for many reasons
for one thing they were under they're
under much harsher repression
incomparably harsher secondly I do
extensively condemn the crimes of
enemies they didn't in fact but I do so
there's many differences I appreciate
that and I'm glad you you pointed those
out I I want to ask you uh because
you're a strong critic or dissident uh
of the United States is there a model
Society is there another country or
jurisdiction that you think America
should be more like I I we all work
towards a an ideal or a Utopia but is
there a manifestation of these ideals on
Earth that you think America should be
more like I don't think there's any
particular society that I would if I
were live I can any society that I can
think of if I were living there I'd
criticizing what it's uh the
the aspects of its policies that deserve
harsh criticism but you're more than
just a grouch you you you have a
particular philosophy of and I want to
know if there's a place on earth that is
more attuned to your Phil I know you
would criticize everything and so
perhaps I'd call you a Critic not a
dissonant is there a better Society than
America Express first of all expressing
criticism of society is not not being a
grouch vat hav was not a
grouch sakarov was not a grouch they
were doing something Shirin body and
Iran is not a grouch they're doing
something very significant uh and they
are not and it's not just negative
you're not saying look stop this crime
it's also saying live up to this ideal
for the United States we should say yes
we should live up to ideals that we
profess we profess a belief in democracy
fine we should try to live up to it to
the extent that we don't it should be
criticized and uh not only just
criticized but active efforts should be
made to overcome it that's the role of I
think any decent person we call them
dissidents in other country so let's
call them that here you're very patient
with me I have two last questions I I
you you mentioned the ideals that all
Americans are striving to live up to and
which will probably never be met I
didn't say which we claim to be Liv we
claim to be thank you you're you're very
precise in your language and I and I
should be more precise in my
characterization of you are America's
ideals themselves Noble or do you uh do
you object to America's ideals as say
expressed in the constitution do you
believe that the American Constitution
is is an idealistic document that we
should work towards and strive towards
the con the US Constitution had positive
elements and quite negative elements
so for example one part of the
Constitution uh authorized U the capture
and return of slaves to their owners
well fortunately many years later that
was overcome there are other things in
the Constitution that are think are um
quite admirable there are others that
should be
changed last document last question
you've been very generous with your time
and my questions certainly are prodding
you you're very kind to answer them I
want to talk about the Middle East we've
talked about it circuitously but you are
a Critic of Israel and and I want to
transpose your comments about being a
Critic of America to being a Critic of
Israel uh Israel has its ideals that it
is claims to want to live up to to use
your phrasing would you acknowledge that
not only Israel's ideals but the level
it has achieved those ideals it's its
reality is morally Superior than than
its neighbors in the Arab world do you
believe that Israel is a morally
superior country than Iran or Syria or
even Egypt in some respects in other
respects not like what well for example
as compared with the others that you
mentioned Israel is a very aggressive in
state for example it's invaded Lebanon
five times uh Iran hasn't invaded anyone
uh it's uh Israel is now in a gross
violation of international national law
the occupation is has been the actions
of Israel in the occupied territories
have been uh harshly condemned by the
security Council of the United Nations
in fact Israel's violating its
directives the international court of
justice has in its advisory opinion uh
concluded that these are in violation of
fundamental international law those are
quite negative facts on the other hand
internally
if you ask is Israel internally more uh
open Democratic uh less repressive than
say Egypt you sure obviously so that's
why I'm a very harsh critic of the
Egyptian
dictatorship last question Professor the
the US state department defines
anti-Semitism as holding Israel to a
double standard that is uh pointing out
criticizing attacking things only in
Israel and not a criticizing them
elsewhere I'm not phrasing it exactly
but that that's the gist of it do you
think that by obsessing over Israel you
mentioned various un hearings and
investigations uh do you think that the
world's obsession with Israel while
ignoring uh similar prosecutions or
examinations or condemnations of uh
Bashar Assad or the Islamic State do you
think that's a sign of anti-Semitism and
do you think antiem ism is on the rise
in the world that's like asking me do I
agree that the moon is made out of green
cheese first of all it's not a fact
there's an overwhelming opposition to uh
the Islamic State of to Assad bitterly
condemned uh how can you say that
they're not criticized I mean it's just
overwhelming including in the Islamic
world but in terms of formal un
resolutions in terms of war crimes
inspections in in terms of the
international criminal Court in terms of
the sheer number of resolutions in terms
of dealing with refugees if you compare
the inspection criticism and
condemnation uh and
resolutions uh against Israel for its
occupation compared to Syria it's which
occupation of Syria are you referring to
well let's say it's treatment of
refugees it's treatment of minorities
Syria has had has been amazing in its
treatment of refugees if we would only
live up to that standard it would be
astonishing I'm not talking about the
last couple of years during the Civil
War but before that the countries that
absorbed refugees at a huge level were
Syria Jordan Lebanon and Iran and these
incidentally are refugees often from our
crimes we don't absorb the refugees from
our crimes they do so several million
people fled Iraq after the US attack did
they come to the United States no they
were absorbed not beautifully I mean
pretty in harsh ways sometimes but they
were absorbed in the neighboring
countries we don't do that is
anti-Semitism On The Rise professor and
I'll let you go after this but I am
curious do you believe that
anti-Semitism in Europe and in the
Middle East is on the rise well anti you
have to be very careful here
anti-Semitism and criticism of the
policies of Israel are two very
different things let's talk about Jew
hatred let's just phrase that way do you
think hatred of Jews Jewish things
synagogues Jewish schools Jewish people
is on the rise in in Europe and the
Middle East the Middle East is a
complicated affair because remember that
uh uh the the the situation in the
Middle East is that the United States is
Israel with us backing crucial us
backing is carrying out what the Israeli
sociologist bar Kling called politicized
destroy ing the national rights of a
national group that's pretty serious so
in the Middle East there's all kind of
reactions to that in Europe there is a
rise of
right-wing uh uh uh sometimes Neo-Nazi
forces which does sometimes take an
anti-semitic uh rightwing what about the
attacks in Paris in
Copenhagen are you calling Muslim
extremist right-wing Professor is that a
code word will you address the Muslim
anti-Semitism about the rise of NE I can
just go into it in detail if you like
those particular cases which
incidentally were massively condemned by
the Muslim communities both in Paris and
in uh Denmark and in fact just just the
other day in Norway there were a
thousand Muslims surrounding a uh a
synagogue uh in protecting it in
condemnation of the attack in Copenhagen
but if you look at these attacks just
take a look at who the people were you
can find out for example there's a
detailed discussion in the current issue
of France's leading international
Affairs Journal am on diplomatic they go
through the background of the uh the
asants in Paris they're Algerian they
come from the slums they are products of
the bitter
Algerian atrocities in the 1990s
uh from which their parents fled uh for
which France had very significant uh
played a very significant role it was
supporting the military regime and the
groups that these young men came from
came out of the protest against that uh
those actions they live in very
marginalized repressed regions in Paris
they've been in and out of Prisons
they've been in involved in uh the kind
of crime that comes from repression and
marginalization it's a pretty ugly
situation Professor it sounds like
you're either trying to they did but
you're avoiding it I mean are you
avoiding it or are you excusing it or or
are you denying it do you do you deny
that there's a a rise in Muslim
anti-Semitism in Europe neither denying
it nor avoiding it trying to understand
it so you acknowledge it exist is
growing it's very easy to scream at
people you don't like it's more serious
to try to understand what the doing and
take constructive actions to prevent it
if you want to scream that's fine you
can always scream at your enemies
Professor I've enjoyed our conversation
today you've been very generous with
your time I I thank you it's nice to
meet you via Skype and uh we call
ourselves the rebels over here too so
we're dissidents in our own way great to
talk to you today Professor nice to talk
you thank you bye-bye
