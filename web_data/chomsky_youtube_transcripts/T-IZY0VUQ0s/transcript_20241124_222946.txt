okay we are recording them
the invasion of Ukraine grinds on
mounting Slaughter and destruction
there is General agreement
that is reaching a
pivotal phase
ukrainians or the primary victims but
they're not alone
throughout the world
many are suffering severely from cut off
of food and fertilizers
the whole world is a victim maybe a
terminal victim of the reversal of the
much too limited efforts to address the
climate emergency in the brief time in
which it will still be possible to do so
it is furthermore all too easy to
outline plausible scenarios
that would lead up the escalation ladder
to Major International War
could easily turn into terminal nuclear
war
Ukraine of course will make its own
decisions as to how to deal with the
critical moments that lie ahead
the rest of us however are not just
passive Observers
surely not those directly participating
in the war
but also the rest of the world
considering what is at stake
Elementary rationality
and morality dictate
that we take a careful and sober look at
the options and Prospects that lie ahead
the war will either end with a
diplomatic settlement or it will not
at least that much is uncontroversial
lacking a diplomatic settlement either
one side will capitulate over the war
will continue with mounting Horrors
that too is hardly controversial
taking a closer look it is highly
unlikely that Russia will capitulate
if it faces defeat it can always
escalate the conflict without limit
it has yet to approach what is possible
with Conventional Weapons as many around
the world know all too well
those who talk bravely about total
victory for Ukraine or to taking a
ghastly gamble with Ukrainian wives
they are gambling that if the Mad Dog
they portray faces defeat he will
silently pack his bags and slink away to
Oblivion or worse
the remaining alternatives to diplomatic
settlement are Ukrainian capitulation or
continuing War
each two awful accountably
it is for such reasons that
International opinion
overwhelmingly is calling towards
calling for moves towards peace and
diplomatic settlement
overwhelmingly but not entirely
the official U.S stand remains that the
war should continue to severely weaken
Russia
this is backed by the claim that if the
war continues Ukraine will be in a
better negotiating position
or a worse negotiating position a
possibility not considered
certainly a weaker position if only
because of the continued Slaughter and
destruction
or moves towards a diplomatic settlement
possible
there's only one way to find out try
China's recent initiative is a serious
starting point
founded on the principle I'll quote
principle of sovereignty Independence
and territorial Integrity of all
countries all countries including
Ukraine as high Chinese officials
confirmed
in the United States
China's proposal was quickly dismissed
if not condemned
along with significant initiatives by
Brazil the Vatican and others
most of the world does not dismiss those
options
quite the contrary most want a quick end
to the Horrors
and are refusing to line up with
Washington much to its discomfiture
they are also less than impressed with
the Declarations of high principles
thanks to Apple experience
that seems to me where we now stand in
rough outline again Ukraine will make
its own decisions as it has a right to
do
the rest are not passive onlookers
surely not those directly participating
in the conflict
the stakes are very high
what is needed is sober thought
careful planning not heroic
pronouncements
ghastly gambles Grant posturing
thank you
thank you Noam I trust this will work
that the recording is there and I wish
you good health and uh
enjoyable engagements missed it all
thank you so much
thank you bye
