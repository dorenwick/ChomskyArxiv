parents are now
touring the united states trying to
bring people to understand the nature of
the
crime that's been committed against him
and to appeal to the u.s
authorities to drop the charges
which is not sufficient in my opinion
should go on to
honor him for what he has done for us
assange performed
a major service to the people of the
united states
many others as well by releasing
to the public information of great value
for understanding what is happening in
the world
the value of the information
is attested by the ways it has been
widely used by journalists by scholars
by the concerned public generally
assange should be honored for this
service
instead he has been brutally persecuted
by british authorities serving
washington's demand that he must be
partially punished for revealing
what u.s power wishes
to be kept hidden for reasons of what's
called
security which means security
of the powerful from public awareness
of their actions and their plans
this gross miscarriage of justice
prolonged over many cruel years
should be ended at once julian assange
should not only be freed but should be
accorded the
great respect that he richly deserves
for his contributions
