joining us now
is professor noam chomsky public
intellectual linguist and author of many
books
including one of the most famous books
manufacturing consent
professor chomsky thank you so much for
taking time to speak to us today
delighted to be with you
i wanted to start off by um asking you
to reflect on our current political
moment
uh in 2020 there were historic
uprisings uh civil unrest in the country
in response to police brutality and i
believe
uh income and wealth inequality as well
you also have a situation in which
people are experiencing a health and
economic crisis
that has not been alleviated
appropriately
by our lawmakers there was a huge debate
about
two thousand dollar direct checks to
americans and our lawmakers failed to
provide that
at a time when so many americans are
desperate to put food on the table
keep a roof over their heads and pay
their rent
and so i wanted to ask you
why it is that following so much
public support for certain policies
congress continuously tells the american
people that they will not deliver and
they do so unapologetically
why do you feel that is
well one place to look always
is where's the money who
funds congress actually there's a
very fine careful study of this by
the leading scholar who deals with
funding issues in politics thomas
ferguson
he and his colleagues did a study about
a year ago careful study in which they
investigated a simple question uh
they what's the correlation
over the years many years between
campaign funding and electability to
congress
it's almost a straight line it's the
kind of close correlation that you
barely
get in the social sciences greater the
funding
higher the electability you can find a
few cases here and there that aren't
right on the line but it's from the
standpoint of social science it's a
remarkable correlation
and in fact uh we all know what happens
when a
congressional representative gets
elected
first day in office they start making
phone calls to the potential donors for
the
next election coming up meanwhile
hordes of corporate lobbyists descend on
their
offices they often have good staff
people often young kids totally
overwhelmed by the
resources the wealth the power of the
massive lobbyists who pour in
out of that comes legislation
which the representative later signs
maybe even looks at occasionally i
wonder if he can get off the phone to
the donors
what do you think what kind of system do
you expect to emerge from this
well we have good studies of it so for
example one
recent quite high level study
found that uh
the lower they they analyzed by income
compared income as compared with uh
decisions by their own representatives
for about 90 percent of the population
there's essentially no correlation
that is they're fundamentally
unrepresented this
extends earlier work by
martin gillins by benjamin page and
others who found
pretty similar results this happens to
be a little more detailed and
sophisticated
but the general picture is clear the
work class most of the middle class are
basically unrepresented
the decisions uh reflect
a very highly concentrated
amount uh campaign money
not just campaign funding shows up in
all sorts of other ways
i mean if you're a congressional
representative
and you're going to leave congress one
of these days either by decision of
course you can vote it out
where do you go do you become a truck
driver
secretary just take a look
well you know where you go and you know
what the reasons
are if you voted the right way you got a
cushy future ahead of you
there are many many devices by which you
can ensure
that the large majority of the
population is unrepresented
and furthermore robbed robbed
massively i mean the scale is
colossal we have plenty of information
about this
the rand corporation ultra respectable
a couple of months ago did a study of
what they call the transfer of wealth
more accurately the robbery of the
public
by since the neoliberal assault began in
around 1980 last 40 years
how much wealth has been transferred
from
the working class and the middle class
they used
same ninety percent figure the lower
ninety percent
of the income scale from them to the
very
top and the very top actually means
fraction of one percent
their estimate is 47 trillion dollars
it's not small change and it's a vast
underestimate
when reagan opened the spigots for
corporate robbery it's called
neoliberalism
uh many devices were opened for example
tax havens shell companies illegal
before that
and the treasury company department
enforce the law
how much money was stolen that way
that's mostly
secret private tyrannies don't let us
know what they're doing but there are
some reasonable estimates
actually there's a imf study that came
out recently that
estimated it maybe in the neighborhood
of 35 trillion dollars
roughly just tax havens over 40 years
well keep adding this up it's not
pennies
and it affects people's lives people are
angry
resentful very good reasons perfect
terrain for
a demagogue to come along trump style
very effective holds up a banner with
one hand saying
i love you i'm going to save you other
hand stabs you in the back
to pay off the rich and powerful that's
what we've been seeing
trump's an extreme example the
democratic national committee is not
that different
different but not that different
in the same game essentially so getting
back to your question i think these are
the answers
and i guess i guess what what i would
follow with is because the
the bernie campaign um for president uh
both of his actually were
were kind of like a um a sort of
organizing principle for
for those of us on the left for a while
and since his defeat in
what was a pretty remarkable coordinated
effort
from the sort of democratic
establishment the liberal establishment
um has left us with a feeling that
there is that there is no kind of next
guiding principle
um i think i think you're seeing kind of
a disorganized
and um encode left in a way
where should those of us on the left uh
direct our energies to address these
immense problems which you just outlined
you know the trillions of dollars on
offshore accounts the
the wholesale purchase of congress by uh
by the business class like
where should we try to direct our
efforts to fight back
well the first thing we should remember
is
that sanders campaign
was a remarkable success i mean within
a couple of years sanderson
others working with him or alongside him
have managed to shift the range of
issues and concerns that are at the
center of attention
very far towards the progressive side
that's quite significant they did it
with no funding
no corporate support no media support
actually the media became mildly
friendly to
sanders after he had lost the nomination
not before before it was kind of like
what happened to corbin in england not
maybe not that extreme but something
similar
powerful forces determined to ensure
that
nothing will go to the left of
the most mild social democracy
in fact if you take a look at so
looking back at the success of his
campaign i think one answer to your
question is
keep at it you can do a lot more of that
remember there was a terrible mistake
that was made
when obama was elected namely a lot of
the left believed him
which was always a terrible error
uh the obama had a tremendous amount of
popular support
especially from young people lots of
young activists and organizers working
to get him elected
but after the election what happened
they they'll go home and unfortunately
they went home
uh we've got our man in the office now
we'll have faith in the pretty rhetoric
so we'll go home so the first thing he
did was stab him in the back of course
and betray them within two years
he completely betrayed his constituency
and it showed up in the 2010 election
it's not that the right wing won the
labor vote
the democrats lost it for good reasons
uh by the in the kennedy replacement
election in massachusetts liberal state
2010 even union voters didn't vote for
the
democratic candidate they saw what obama
had done
okay the uh well we shouldn't make that
mistake again
certainly not with biden biden
it's kind of a kind of a weak read in my
opinion he can be
pressed the important part of the biden
administration first of all there are
some quite good people in it
especially among the economic advisors
but they can be pressed we saw it on
some of the most
important things so take
climate change there isn't any more
important issue
if we don't deal with the environmental
catastrophe
soon everything else is moot there won't
be anything to talk about
the few okay maybe not much more
the a lot of pressure on the biden
harris campaign
from sunrise movement others did
manage to press their program
toward the progressive side not far
enough
but still the best program that's ever
been produced
not bad that meant you could go further
the dnc started hacking away at it
it was pretty striking to watch what
happened i
don't have inside information so can
only speculate from what you can see
but what you can see is and i looked at
it i was looking at it
regularly because i was giving lots of
talks on the
interviews on the election i kept
looking at the democratic
program on the web uh
through or up through august it
prevented
when you looked up when you googled the
democratic party
climate program you got the
biden harris program
the last time i saw it was august 22nd
next time i looked a couple of days
later
wasn't there what you got is how to
donate to the dnc
well we can guess what happened
i can only speculate but i think that's
the struggle that's going on
and it could continue if the left
doesn't make the obama mistake and
believe those who are in power and their
pretty words
the same is true of the corporate sector
incidentally which is running scared
they're concerned with what they call
reputational risks
meaning peasants are common with the
pitchforks
so all across the corporate world you
saw that davis you saw it in the
business roundtable
group of corporate executives there's
discussions of how we have to confess to
the public
that we've done the wrong things we
haven't paid enough attention to the
stakeholders workforce community
but now we realize our errors now we've
overcome them now we're
humane and dedicated to everyone
now we're becoming what in the 1950s
was called soulful corporations
really dedicated to the common good
forget all this business about making
money
that's just on the side so now we have
lots of soulful corporations appealing
to the public
on their great humanity sometimes taking
measures
like withdrawing funding from
fossil fuel companies and so on they can
be pressed
no i don't like the system you don't
like the system
but it exists okay and
we have to work within it to change it
we can't say i don't want it let's have
another system
that doesn't exist it can be done
by pressure from inside and from outside
so for example there's no reason to
avoid
working to try to create an alternative
political framework and social framework
that ranges from a new party
true left party to actions in the
economy like
taking over creating
worker owned enterprises and
cooperatives and all
localism and agriculture all sorts of
things
there's a point as a whole array of
options open to us
and they all have to be pursued
so i can ask you 28 questions based on
the answer you just gave right now so
many interesting points to touch on but
i'll i'll stick to uh the theme of what
the left should
focus his energies on because i i agree
with you in that
bernie sanders was certainly incredibly
successful
in uh waking people up so they
think about politics in terms of um with
class consciousness which i think was
really missing from
um the mindset of the electorate
previously
he also did spark quite a bit of anger
because realizing
just how much the system is rigged
against the average american
um infuriates people and that anger and
rage is is now
i think metastasizing during this
pandemic as americans uh you know do not
get the
real financial relief that they
desperately need but what i find
interesting is that the response from
our congressional lawmakers including
democrats
has been so incredibly defiant um you
know you have people at this point uh
vandalizing you know the homes of mitch
mcconnell and nancy pelosi as a result
of their unwillingness to do the right
thing for the american people
and this isn't a question about morality
this is really about
um power who holds power in the country
and who wields it and who can actually
use it to their advantage
what i'm seeing among the left right now
is a willingness to
engage in mass protests a willingness to
uh confront politicians and do so
um militantly but it happens
sporadically and it happens in an
unorganized way and so i i wanted to ask
you
how do we effectively organize
especially at a time when it seems like
there is um some emerging disagreement
among
leftists as to whether or not organizing
has been
productive or successful i think people
are getting incredibly um
impatient with the lack of influence
toward our congressional lawmakers
so i wanted you to share your thoughts
on that
well the lack of influence goes back
in the united states uh roughly 250
years
so we can start with the constitution
which was established explicitly on the
principle of preventing democracy
there wasn't any secret about it i'm
quite open about it
in fact the uh the major scholarly study
the gold standard for scholarship on the
constitutional convention
uh michael clarman harvard law
professors called
the framers coup the coup against
democracy
by the framers that goes in detail is
not a radical point
of view it just goes through the
hundreds of pages of details of the
discussions comes out very clearly
uh this the theme of the con
of the founders basically was expressed
quite well by john jay who was first
supreme
court chief justice he said those who
own the country
ought to govern it that's what we see
today in the matters we were just
discussing
those who owned the country have
succeeded in governing it
okay it hasn't been a uniform procedure
there's been plenty of resistance and
lots of victories have been won
so my childhood for example 1930s
there were major victories by
mainly spearheaded by the organized
labor movement
cio organizing militant strikes militant
labor actions
moderately sympathetic administration
some a lot of political activism of all
sorts
some good things happen us move towards
moderate social democracy not
we're still enjoying some of the
benefits of that they've been a lot of
it's been chipped away
well no reason why they can't and the
other periods of american history that
are similar
in the late 19th century the most
radical
popular movements in us history develop
knights of labor the populist movement
has
nothing to do with what's called
populism today radical farmers
they were getting together
a major movement finally crushed by
force
state corporate force but uh
but with the residue this is a
fundamentally a class struggle that goes
on through
history you know and we're now we're in
a particular stage of it
well to say we're disappointed because
we haven't succeeded
it's like saying we're in the world yes
we keep struggling make improvements
some regression
keep going slavery was overcome
and uh after hundreds of years of
struggle then it came back in another
form
still the residue is still there but
it's not that there's no victory at all
you know there are things are better
than they were
because of constant struggle in fact
this country is a lot better than it was
50 years 60 years ago mainly
because of the activism of the 60s just
remember what the country
was in the 1960s
i mean the country had
anti-miscegenation laws
so extreme that the nazis refused to
accept them
because they were too extreme
federal funded housing by law
or afro-americans not because
the liberal senators wanted that but
because you couldn't get anything
through
the southern democratic stranglehold on
policy
uh social security was designed to
exclude
afro-americans domestic workers
agricultural
workers i mean there were anti-sodomy
laws into this
this century now lots of things have
changed
not easy but if you say well we haven't
gotten where we wanted i'm going to quit
you just guarantee that the worst is
going to happen
it's a constant struggle and it can be
done at every level
for as i said take take say
tony mizaki one of the heroes of
modern labor and environmentalism
the head of the oil chemical atomic
workers union
one of the first serious
environmentalists in the country
his constituents are right at the front
line
being murdered by pollution
destruction of the environment and so on
this is the early 70s
way before the environmental movement
took off
the his union under his leadership was
working very strongly to move towards
dealing with the environmental crisis
moved on to
try to establish a labor party in the
90s it could have worked
didn't make it uh the neoliberal assault
beginning with reagan on through clinton
obama
was designed to destroy labor
every step of the way moves were made to
undermine
the labor movement was explicit
reagan's campaign opened with an attack
on the labor unions
even bringing in scabs to destroy
strikes
corporations quickly picked it up
thatcher did exactly the same thing in
england
the people behind the neoliberal assault
understood what they were doing you have
to eliminate
the ability of laboring people to defend
themselves
if you want to crush them the way has
been done
so that was the first step it's been
quite successful
clinton extended it his uh
neoliberal globalization policies were
designed to
protect investors and to crush labor and
they did it
and uh that has to be re that's similar
to the 30s
in the 1920s labor had been virtually
crushed
the u.s has a very violent labor history
much worse than comparable countries to
business-run society to an unusual
extent
there was a militant successful labor
movement early part of the
20th century after woodrow wilson's red
scare was almost destroyed
1920s it was almost nothing there
came roaring back in the 30s that's what
led to the
new deal policies the mild social
democracy that we still
benefit from well it can be done again
in fact it's beginning to happen quite
interesting ways
so labor had been so crushed by the
neoliberal policies that there barely
were any strikes
workers were afraid to go on strike
they'd be destroyed
started to pick up in red states
ununionized labor teachers in
west virginia and arizona enormous
public support on
arizona when the teachers began to
strike there was popular sport
all over the place look all over lawns
there's
you know posters saying uh support the
teachers you know
and they weren't just calling for higher
salaries
which they very much deserve but calling
for
improving the educational system which
has been
very harshly hit by the neoliberal
plague
one part of it has been aimed at the
educational system
privatization defunding
regimentation teaching to test all of
these things
bipartisan i mean republicans are more
extreme so
betty devos was almost openly devoted to
destroying the whole system
doesn't have to be that bad but obama's
policies weren't
much better if you want to look at them
it's
here's the teacher's strike lots of
popular support
nurses strikes service units
sometimes on you know sometimes opposed
by the unions
but taking off it's affected other
elements of the working class
big gm strike and more of that could
happen
the destruction of labor has been a
major factor
in the extreme inequality um
there are some mainstream economists
like
lauren summers who've concluded that
it's
the major factor in the extreme
inequality
just taking away the ability of workers
to
defend themselves certainly a major
factor
that can come back alternative political
parties like
mazakis could come back
pressure on the democrats to move to the
left like the kind of thing that
ocasio-cortez squad others are doing
that can have an effect
it's got to have a lot of popular action
behind it
if the troops go home say i'm
disappointed i didn't get what i wanted
it's going to move to the right there's
one force that's resentless
relentless they never stop the business
classes
are marxists dedicated marxists
they're fighting a vicious class war
all the time they never stop if they
have an opportunity
they'll move ahead if the rest of the
population
leaves the struggle you know what's
going to happen in fact we've seen 40
years of it
yeah well i want to ask a little bit
about the that class struggle
because you know piketty for example has
pointed out that
um across the western democracies and
it's happened here in the united states
certainly the class composition of the
parties has been
shifting uh pretty in striking ways you
know
we've seen this kind of phenomenon of
the so-called never trump republicans
flocking to the democratic party um the
democratic party's
base shifting toward these kind of more
upper upper middle class
suburban voters whereas
the republicans still don't win
working-class boaters but are certainly
making inroads
in the working class in ways that they
hadn't in the past
what do you make of of that phenomenon
that's happened here in the united
states but also
in in europe um where these sort of
traditional left-wing parties
are are becoming parties more and more
of the sort of educated elites and
um and the sort of working classes
getting shut out basically
well let's start with the united states
there is something similar in europe
so by the late 1970s late carter years
the democrats basically told the working
class
that we don't have any interest in you
in the late 70s
the last gasp of pro-labor
activity in the democratic party was the
humphrey hawkins full employment act in
i think 1978.
carter didn't veto it but he watered it
down
so it was toothless it was left
voluntary
okay meaning nice words but you don't do
anything about it
from that point on the democrats
essentially abandoned the working class
a few gestures here and there when
clinton came
uh take take a look at nafta and nafta
was rammed through
in secret over the objections of the
labor movement
they weren't even informed until the
last minute
of what the what the framework was
investor rights agreement actually they
came out
at the last minute the labor advisory
council did come out with an
alternative program for nafta so here's
a much better way to do it
your version the executive version is
going to lead to a
low growth low wage economy here's a way
to do it with a
high growth high wage economy happened
that their program was
almost the same as that of the
congress's
own research agency
the office of technology assessment
congress at that time did have a
research agency
congress decided they don't want to be
bothered by stuff like information
so they destroyed it a couple years
later but
used to be around but the otap program
and the lac
program labor advisory committee were
quite similar
nobody paid attention to them never
reported
executive branch didn't care they wanted
their version of nafta
which has been you is perfectly clear in
advance that
you have a an arrangement that's
basically an investor rights agreement
that sets working people in competition
with
each other without rights you can tell
what's going to happen
and it did in fact worse than what was
expected
turned out that under clinton's nafta
uh corporations were able to
use to break organizing efforts
at a very high level about 50 percent of
them
were broken simply by threats to move
the enterprise
to mexico if the threats weren't serious
they weren't going to do it but the
threat is enough
to break the organizing effort happens
to be illegal
but when you have a criminal state you
can carry out illegal acts
so they were carried out very
effectively
the good study of this under nafta rules
actually
by kate brontenbrenner labor economist
at cornell
founded what i just described that about
50
of organizing efforts were broken
illegally
just by threats to move the enterprise
there's only one example but
labor has just been smashed by the
democrats so
well i told you what happened in 2008 do
you know it yourself
but 2008 labor voted for obama
2010 gone they had seen what the
promises meant
remember what happened then this was a
the midst of a financial crisi huge
financial crisis caused by the
collapse of the housing market congress
under bush in fact
had passed legislation tarp legislation
to do something about it
the legislation had two components one
was
to bail out the perpetrators of the
crisis
the banks who had caused the crisis with
predatory lending practices and other
devious semi-criminal actions
so you have to bail them out the other
part of the legislation
was to bail out the victims people had
lost their homes
under foreclosures lost their jobs do
something for them
anybody who knows american history and
politics
could have predicted which half of the
legislation
was going to be implemented by president
obama
well maybe workers didn't know all the
details but they could see it in their
lives
within two years
the working class had large parts of it
even the unionized working class and
said this party isn't working for us
they're around me where can you go
you can go to the guys who claim
that they're gonna uh bring back
traditional america or
get your jobs not going to do it of
course but they at least claim to
you take a look at trump voters they've
been carefully studied
a lot of them say yeah we know he's a
jerk he's not going to do anything
but at least he says that he likes us
okay
he stands up and says i'm with you
i'm one of you guys i act like you it's
like george bush
w bush you may recall that on every
weekend he
would go off to his
to texas and his farm and be
filmed cutting brush and
temperature so he's a real ordinary guy
you know
after he left office i don't think he
ever went back there
right yeah that's such a good point put
on this act
you know one of you guys sometimes comic
who
remembered john kerry when he was
running
decided to show that he's an ordinary
guy so he went windsurfing
[Laughter]
yeah one of the other examples was mitt
romney in 2012
uh who wanted to brag about his costco
uh button-down t-shirts um
so that kind of theater definitely takes
place to uh pander to working americans
um but i'm sorry i think i interrupted
you did you want to finish your point
well let me just say that the trump
voters if you look at them
the most careful studies i've seen are
those of
tony dimaggio very good social
scientists
left social scientists in a lot of books
and articles
but he did recent analysis on what's
known so far about the
2020 trump voters and it looks like
once again the core apart from
the evangelicals you know the white
supremacists
apart from those sectors the main
voting base for trump is basically
petty bourgeois in incomes from
one to two hundred thousand dollars way
beyond the median
that's not working people uh small
businessmen insurance salesmen and so on
that seems to be the main base
and even greater than in 2016
seems to increase the only part that
increased substantially
a lot of working people think well lucy
says something nice to us
democrats don't do anything actually we
saw this dramatically in
some of the areas that have been
there's been a lot of lament about so
take say south texas
there's been a lot of study of why south
texas
which hadn't voted for a republican for
a hundred years
since harding moved towards trump
these are mexican-american communities
how come they broke with a hundred years
of voting democrat
well you take a close look you can see
why
first of all the democrats didn't make
the slightest effort to do any
organizing
they're hispanics they vote for us
people don't like that you know but
there was a more serious reason
these are oil producing areas all that
they heard
was biden wants to take away our jobs
destroy our families destroy our
economies
because a bunch of pointy-headed rich
liberals claim there's a climate crisis
okay if the democrats cared at all
about working people they would have
been down there
saying look there's a climate crisis
we are going to have to transition away
from
fossil fuels period you don't do that
nothing's going to be left but you can
have better jobs
better lives better economy
by moving towards working on
changing the industries maybe under your
own control
to sustainable energy and
constructive development like mass
transportation
instead of traffic jams lots of other
things that's what organizers do
okay they didn't bother working class is
not their constituency
so they voted for the guy who says i'm
gonna
bring your jobs back
there's this ongoing uh there's this
ongoing debate about
uh whether or not the republican party
can be
legitimately and sincerely become um the
party of the working class
uh this debate about uh right-wing
populism
um and i would really love to hear your
thoughts on that uh
because i think it's important to push
back against that idea especially when
you consider the material interests at
play
uh but i am seeing uh right wingers uh
on
media like tucker carlson for instance
who
seems to pander to the frustrations that
so many americans are feeling in the
corporate world
but i mean when push comes to shove i i
i'm very skeptical that he genuinely
cares about
workers or changing the system to make
it a little more equal
for for people who don't have as much
power as executives in these
corporations
but i wanted to hear your thoughts is it
possible for
the working class to work together
regardless of their overall political
ideology whether they're on the right or
the left
first of all they have to have something
to vote for
if the democrats say we don't care about
you now we're the party of wall street
and rich professionals
uh we have hollywood stars at our
events and who cares about you huh
yeah they'll vote for the guy who's i
like you
i act like you i i hate the a leagues
vote for that guy even if he's not doing
anything for them
and in fact screwing them uh if you want
to look at these
republicans who claim to be
pro-working-class
take a look at how they vote so take a
look at how they voted on
the one legislative achievement of the
trump administration
the tax scam which gave a huge amount of
money to the very rich
and is stabbing the working class in the
in the back
how'd they vote on that uh how do they
vote on
the way the the stem the cares program
was administrated
so that it goes to banks who then decide
how to distribute it and they give it to
their rich clients
so billionaires are making out like you
know
like uh pirates what's amazing
they're doing great so ask how they
voted on that now take a look at the
actual legislative actions
it's very easy to get up and say i'm for
the workers you know
easy uh if nobody else is saying
anything else maybe people say well
at least he says he likes us unless
there's an
alternative nobody's the votes don't
mean anything people are voting just out
of frustration if they vote at all
remember almost half the population
didn't even bother
the uh so unless there's a
constructive alternative people aren't
going to join
and it there can be i mean it's pretty
amazing when you look at the united
states
take a look at the liberal press the
most liberal commentators
people i like actually writing about the
sanders campaign
they said his proposals are
very good but they're too radical for
the american people
we've got to be more mild we can't be
that radical
what are the proposals that are too
radical
take a look at sanders's the programs he
highlighted
top one universal medical care
do you know of any other country that
has universal medical care
i mean can you think of a country that
doesn't have it
he's one of the chief correspondents of
the
london financial times rana
farahar she's associate editor very good
columnist
wrote a column in which sort of
half-jokingly
she said that if sanders was in germany
he could be running on the christian
democrat program
the right-wing party of course they're
in favor of universal health care who
isn't
you know the other program is free
higher education and you find it almost
everywhere
the most high performing countries in
finland others
sure europe mexico it's all over the
place
that's too radical for the american
people i mean that's an
insult to the american population that's
hard to find words to express that's
coming from the
left end of the mainstream spectrum
well the left the authentic left ought
to be able to break through that
in order to be able to break through and
say that sanders's programs
wouldn't have much surprised eisenhower
eisenhower was strongly pro new deal
his position was anyone who questions
the new deal doesn't belong in
the american political system i mean
under the neoliberal years things have
moved so far to the right
at the elite level at the power level
but it's hard to remember what was
normal not long before
well these are tasks for the left you
can reach people with that
you can reach people with reviving the
labor movement
moving towards a labor party pressing
the
liberal part of the democratic party
towards
moderately social democratic ends
particularly
on things like climate should also
mention
nuclear weapons it's not talked about
it's a major threat to our existence the
threat is increasing
enormously one of trump's many crimes
was to
dismantle the whole arms control system
and move initiate moves towards creating
very dangerous new weapon systems that
has to be terminated quickly
or we're in serious trouble that can be
done
all of these things can be done there's
plenty of options open
i don't think there's a shortage of
causes to engage in
actively the problem is the will to do
it
you mentioned getting the various
segments of the left together
you have to get to gather on these
things you can differ on other things
but there are some major things that are
just
essential for literally for human
survival
and yes they have to be worked on hard
and i think most of the population is
ready for them
and you know talking about
climate change as as this existential
threat which i think we all
obviously we all agree that it is i
think that it's it's
you know when i think about it and i
think about you know we live under
capitalism market society profit driven
society it just seems like
we won't be able to truly fix the
climate problem until we move
beyond capitalism in some way which
traditionally we've
called basically socialism like do you
think it's still
useful to think about it in those terms
as a sort of political horizon
it's useful but there's some facts we
have to remember
one of them is time scale
we have a decade or two
to deal decisively
with the environmental crisis we're not
going to overthrow capitalism
in a couple of decades i think that
doesn't mean you stop working for it
you can continue working for it but
recognizing
that the solution is going to have to
come
within some kind of regimented
capitalist
system not the neoliberal system
there are a variety of kinds of
capitalism
so you go back to the pre-neo-liberal
period this period of so-called
regimented capitalism
very different from this and within that
framework of
serious uh government control
of the destructive
excesses of unleashed capitalism you
have a chance to proceed
meanwhile should be doing exactly what
you said trying to undermine these
and again i think people can understand
it
take the fundamental evil of capitalism
which was always understood by
traditional socialists
namely the fact that you have to have a
job
we consider having a job a wonderful
thing
working people in the early industrial
revolution
regarded it as an obscenity a
fundamental attack on
essential human rights and dignity that
was such a strong
position that it was a slogan of the
republican party under
under lincoln that uh wage labor
differs from slavery only and that it's
temporary
so you can become a free person well
that can be implemented
by worker control of the enterprises in
which they
are part you're not going to get it in
actually you can't even get it in one
step like worker owner
enterprises which are proliferated but
you can get it by
a series of steps like
even which have been proposed like
warren and sanders proposed a worker
representation on
the corporate managing boards it's not
very radical
germany has it for example conservative
country
but it gives you some step forward you
can move forward beyond that
with direct action on the ground
like for example worker-owned
enterprises
to changing the nature of the
way in which the capitalist system works
you have a carbon tax don't do it like
they did it in france
a cronk which led to the yellow vest
movement
of carbon tax which hits the working
class
designed to hit the working class yeah
you do that you're going to get an
uprising
you can have a carbon tax which
in which the revenue is
returned to the public in a progressive
manner
then it benefits the working class yes
you pay a little more for gas but you
get more in return
same with uh health care
save a huge amount of money if we had a
universal health care system
but you are going to pay higher taxes
and you'll save twice that much on your
insurance premiums
so you have to get that to people okay
those are the tasks for the left
educational
organizational activist i think there's
a
tremendous range of opportunities
available
but it's not enough to know what to do
you have to do it yeah
wow uh professor chomsky
we're gonna have to wrap up the
interview pretty soon but i wanted to
make sure to give you
um a note because it's important
first of all i don't know how uh people
like you who's
experienced so much including being
banned from legacy media publications
for your
opinions i can remain a fighter
uh someone who's optimistic you seem to
still be pretty optimistic about what
can be accomplished in the future
but i wanted to give you a note from one
of my journalism students
who in the past semester was required in
my class to read manufacturing consent
and after the class was over he sent me
an email saying that
you know this is an upper division of
journalism class so he's going to
graduate soon and he felt
pretty disconnected uh from this line of
work and felt that
you know he wasn't excited about it he
saw that you know journalists really
just read from a script or
you know do what their editors tell them
to do but reading your book
um lit a fire within him and all of a
sudden
he has this passion for journalism that
he
didn't feel before um so i just wanted
to
you know give you my um wholehearted
appreciation
for the work that you've done not just
in manufacturing consent but for
uh challenging people's preconceived
notions and encouraging them to continue
to fight
for a more more just society um and i'll
i'll end this with one more question to
you
how do you remain optimistic that
we can fight successfully for real
change
that benefits ordinary people
well one easy way is to just look at
what i see
on the screen people committed
to struggling for a better world
and there are plenty of people like you
okay
perfectly good reason to be optimistic i
mean i
can't do it much more getting too old
but i used to travel around a lot to
some of the poorest most oppressed areas
of the world
laos southern colombia kurdish areas in
turkey and palestinian refugee camps
most miserable places you can find
plenty of people are optimistic
they don't give up in comparably worse
conditions than
opportunity we have opportunities they
can't dream of
but they don't give up they're
struggling you go to a
poor rural community in
in colombia you know hours away from the
highway when i get to the community the
first thing you see is a
small cemetery where graves white
crosses for people who are killed in the
latest paramilitary attack
you get into the town
welcome have a meal go to a meeting
they're talking about how to save the
mountain next to them
from corporate predators will destroy
their
water supply and so on but they're
struggling
optimistically i mean you see people
like that
everywhere here too how can you not
share in their
optimism with all of our privileges and
advantages
well professor noam chomsky thank you so
much again for taking the time to speak
with us
uh we covered a lot of ground here and
it's always a pleasure to speak with you
um hopefully you'll come on again in the
future hope so
absolutely thank you professor
