um I had well let's see tell me is this
at too high a level of abstraction you
mentioned that this uh everything you're
discussing here uh is based on a system
of money can one conceive of a a system
operating without
money are are we on yeah uh yeah I think
that we we're talking about very
concrete questions uh can we think about
a different social order yeah I think we
can think about a very different social
order uh getting rid of money is one
part of it which I don't think is the
crucial part uh The crucial part is
getting rid of
tyranny uh we happen to be living in a
system which would have driven the
founding fathers up the wall uh and
which any Enlightenment figure like Adam
Smith or someone would have found
horrendous it's a it's a tyrannical
system in which power is more and more
going into the hands of totalitarian
structures which are
unaccountable uh namely private Corp
corporations the the as has long been
understood these are tyrannical
structures they are like totalitarian
States they combine in the command
center uh judicial uh legislative and
executive powers they're pretty much
unaccountable to anyone they're huge in
scale by now they they invol they were
created for distorting markets and they
carry out extreme Market Distortion like
in they they internalize risk they don't
they free participants from Market
discipline and they have a million other
ways of uh undermining markets whether
one thinks markets are good or bad uh in
any event these are tyrannical systems
which have no right to exist anymore
than other tyrannical systems and they
have an extraordinary effect over life I
mean they are the media when we talk
about the media reflecting their
interests that's uh you know like saying
I reflect my interests yes of course
they do the it's not just the media it's
the entertainment industry and you know
advertising and so on this is all a
reflection of a network of private
tyrannies they have an overwhelming
effect on government uh they don't like
government because government has a
defect it's
partially influenceable by the public
whereas GE is not influenceable at all
so the idea so they've been trying to
create for 50 years they've been trying
to create a mood of anti-politics you
know hate the government true we have
the government pretty much by the throat
but it's not totally those guys out
there can still influence it so let's
get them to hate the government in
particular to hate the federal
government state governments aren't so
bad they're small enough so we can
really run them totally federal
government is fairly large and you know
you can't kick them around too much uh
that's the point behind the Devolution
getting things down to the state level
under some circumstances it might be
Democratic under these circumstances
it's anti-democratic you move things
down to the state level and even
middle-sized businesses can tell them
what to do uh it's at the government
National level well okay maybe you know
Microsoft and GE but not small guys uh
so let's get power down decision when
you when you when you take say uh um
afdc any any kind of so-called welfare
system you put it down to the state
level you're guaranteeing that it's not
going to go to poor people because at
that level even middle-sized businesses
can insist upon regressive fiscal
measures and shift in the tax code and
this that and the other thing which will
mean that the money goes to the rich uh
at the federal level it's harder you're
pushing around the bigger things so the
idea is get reduce the federal
government except for the parts that
work for us like and those increase like
the Pentagon say so increase that one
because that works for us but cut down
the parts that work for anyone else go
down to the state level uh reduce them
even further put even more uh decision-
making into the hands of private
unaccountable power that's the core of
the system and that's what's got to be
dismantled totally I me it has no
legitimacy
comes out of the same intellectual Roots
as Fascism and bolshevism and ought to
be dismantled the same way uh where you
go from there well you know there one
could discuss uh there are lots of ways
in which you could have a democratically
run Society uh it's worth discussing and
thinking about but the existence of
money it seems to me as a side part of
it uh maybe money should be part of a
decent Society maybe it shouldn't I
suspect it probably should some form of
means of exchange but it's kind of like
a technical question on the side the
real question is
tyranny
