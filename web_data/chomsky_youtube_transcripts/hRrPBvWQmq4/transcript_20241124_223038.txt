the pathology of islamophobia
is growing throughout the west
it's taking its most lethal form
in india
where the modi government is
systematically dismantling indian
secular democracy
and turning the country country
into a
hindu ethnocracy
with almost 250 million muslims becoming
a persecuted minority
the assault is taking other forms as
well
including a general attack
on independent thought
and the educational system
primarily directed against muslim
victims
but by now expanding beyond
that's part that's apart from india's
terrible crimes in kashmir
those crimes have a long history
they've been sharply escalated by modi's
right wing
hindu nationalist regime
kashmir is now
brutally occupied
territory under harsh military control
similar in some ways to occupied
palestine
there are some bright spots
like kerala
and there's courageous resistance
everywhere
but the thousand-year war
that william polk
eloquently described
continues to be waged in full force
the situation
in south asia
is particularly painful
not only
because of what is happening
in pakistan as well
but also because of what is not
happening
it's not a secret
that if current trends persist
much of south asia
will be literally uninhabitable
in the not distant future
because of the ongoing
destruction of the environment
there are feasible steps
that can be taken
to avert this
horrendous catastrophe
they are not being taken
at anything even close to what is needed
instead
policies are directed to cruel
repression
and preparation for terminal war
the crime of course
is not restricted to south asia
the massive burden of guilt
lies on the rich countries of the west
but the global south
which did not create the crisis
will be its most tragic victims
indeed already are
with south asia's torment
among the worst
there is hope
there are opportunities
not for long
thank you
