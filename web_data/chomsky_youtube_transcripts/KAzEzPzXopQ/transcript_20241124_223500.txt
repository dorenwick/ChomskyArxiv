uh my name is no chsky I'm a professor
at uh
MIT uh I've been following the case of
the three hikers with great deal of
concern since the beginning one
thankfully has been released two Josh
fatel and Shane Bower are still in
custody I'd like to say a few words
about these two extraordinary young
people they have uh dedicated themselves
to advocating for social and
environmental justice in Africa and
elsewhere and they truly embody the
spirit of
humanitarianism I hope and trust that
the government of Iran will recognize
this and treat them with the same
humanitarian concern that they have
shown in their own lives and
work I hope that they'll be released
without a trial if there is one I'd be
happy to testify on their good record
and their dedication to worthy and
important
causes uh I believe that Shane and Josh
have been imprisoned for much too long
they've been denied due process they've
been subjected to extreme
psychological stress I would finally
like to appeal once again to the Iranian
authorities to take the just and
compassionate step and to free them
without any further delay
