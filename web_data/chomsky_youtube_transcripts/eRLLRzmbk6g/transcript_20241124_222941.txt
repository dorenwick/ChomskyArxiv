my name is Matt Kennard head of
Investigations at Declassified UK on May
23rd 2023 I interviewed Professor Nome
chumsky the most important public
intellectual in the world with a view
that he could write a forward to my new
book The racket a rogue reporter vs the
American Empire we covered a whole range
of themes to do with the book but also
his work going back many many decades
unfortunately a few weeks after the
interview he fell very sick but his
words are extremely important and speak
to many themes and many issues which are
exercised in the global population right
now so they need to be heard so here it
is I hope you enjoy it hi gnome thanks
for joining me today thank you today
we're going to be mostly talking about
my book The racket aoga reporter vs the
American Empire which was mostly
reported while I was at the financial
times and has reporting from all over
the world from Haiti to Tunisia to
Bolivia to Turkey um all of countries
and all themes that you've written about
for many
decades firstly I wanted to ask you um
you've said previously that Financial
Times is the only major international
newspaper that tells the truth why do
you think that is well the financial
times is a mainly a business
press uh which means
that rather like the Wall Street
Journal does quite good reporting
editorial pages are another matter
though at the financial times they're I
would say
generally more serious than the
norm
so it's generally true I found over the
years that the business press tends to
provide less doctrinal
more uh
accurate reporting of a fairs that have
any relation to the business world and I
think that's
understandable the business Community
basically runs the world they have to
understand U they can't be too diluted
about uh events of the world and forces
at work and so on but I should say that
in the
Ft some of the commentators are quite a
quite a
the financial times sent me to Haiti the
year after the earthquake to cover the
so-called reconstruction there the US
had near complete control over the
country can you describe briefly the uh
us role in Haiti over recent
history well we can
start I mean the whole history is so
disgraceful and shameful it's painful to
talk about it since 1804
when Haiti made the mistake of uh
becoming the first free country of free
men in the hemisphere and overthrowing
slavery the world the soall Civilized
world was had Tantrums about it tried
hard to destroy it the US refused even
to recognize Haiti till 1862
recognized Haiti and Liberia
as places where you could send freed
slaves then comes an awful history which
I won't
recount by the
19 uh
80s 90s the US was still strongly
supporting the
dictatorships vicious brutal
dictatorships there was an election in
first free election in the country in
1989 everyone assumed that it would be
won by the us back candidate a world
Bank official from the elite nobody was
paying attention to the organizing that
was going on in the slums and the hills
which was pretty
remarkable and they managed
to
win with a overwhelming majority
they managed to elect Jean
pauled populist priest with quite a
strong record of courageous opposition
to the
dictatorship well the States was of
course
infuriated uh not going to tolerate
this he had seven months in
office and was
achieving quite remarkable results he
was even impr even the international
financial institutions World Bank IMF
were quite impressed with the
overthrowing of corruption the positive
actions and so on well he was overthrown
in a
coup
uh tedly backed by the United States not
so secretly after seven months they
instituted A Reign of extreme
torture and oppression I actually
visited in those years it was I've been
in a lot of pretty awful
places in around the world but I've
never seen such fear and misery as right
shortly after the cidras who take over
people were simply they wouldn't even
talk to him the most they'd say is there
are voices is everywhere I their their
eyes everywhere I can't say anything and
the poverty was
Indescribable well that lasted through
the Clinton years finally in me the
there was a very interesting the Clinton
Administration finally agreed to allow
ared to return s the Marines restored
him but on condition
on that he accept very harsh economic
programs which doomed the country to
further disaster he had to let in with
no
restrictions
you us AGR bus produced
rice and from Clinton's home state
mostly
incidentally uh Haitian farmers are
quite efficient but they can't kill
compete with highly subsidized us Agri
business so that was going to virtually
Wipe
Out the basis for peasant Society but it
was worse than that I happened at that
time to be
following the AP direct news through
some system that had been worked out
briefly you watch AP news it's quite
interesting you're getting direct moment
Moment by moment reporting without any
filtering just what the reporter seeing
but every day on the AP News there's one
story
selected featured say for it there's a
break they say for editors this is the
top story for the day well the day that
the Marines were going to land with a
lot of hoopla about how wonderful it is
we're liberating Haiti the top story
that day
was that the treasury Department had
been permitting Texico oil company to
send oil to the Hun now that's very
important there were almost no
restrictions on the military Hunter Rich
could go to Miami and Shop buy whatever
they wanted no problems there was one
thing they couldn't get oil and the CIA
was testifying to Congress that all oil
shipments had been
cut just walking around PTO prance you
could see that that's not true but you
could see the mevs family the rich
family building
oil facilities so obviously it was
coming in well it turned out that
secretly the Clinton Administration was
was providing oil to the hunter the one
thing they couldn't get
U I was writing an article about it but
I barely even mentioned this I know my
article wouldn't come out for six weeks
I thought by then it would be a big
story well nothing it simply wasn't
reported uh had to be the story is US
liberating Haiti not us destroyed Haiti
by supporting the military
Hunter I was able to leak this material
to my friend Alex
Coburn who was writing I think for the
nation at that time and he did do a
story about it but that's the only thing
that appeared this is particularly
interesting to me because of a childhood
experience in
the uh around 19 late 30s early 40s I
was pretty closely following the Spanish
Civil
War uh the official position of the
United States and other liberal
democracies was
neutrality wouldn't participate that's a
gift to the AIS and to Franco of course
because Germany and Italy were arming
them anding and for the liberal
democracies to say neutrality is to say
okay we'll let them be
destroyed there was one thing that
Germany and Italy could Supply
oil the in the leftwing press that I was
reading at the time they reported that
the treasure Department had allowed the
Texico oil company to break its
contracts with the Republic and to ship
oil to
Franco the government of course denied
this later it turned out that they were
they conceded quietly that it was true
same Oil Company
then history replayed in
a unbelievably ugly way well then come
the following
years I won't go through the details it
was impossible for Haiti to reconstruct
under the harsh conditions that Clinton
imposed Clinton in fact later apologized
for them finally there was another
election our St was elected
again US Canada and
France basically invaded ha kidnapped
him sent him off to the Central African
Republic uh shut him up uh restored the
government
to brutal thugs his party lavalas man
party wasn't even allow to participate
well that's the way it continues until
now by now the country is such a hideous
wreck
it's hard to know if it can even be
reconstructed maybe it's
best would be to have China invest in it
that's not a joke
incidentally uh it's it's it's a history
of centuries of vicious murderous
torture and
violence mainly not for secret reasons
black men overthrew
slavery became a free country of black
men not women uh that was just
intolerable especially to the slave
Society next door France is and even
worse France imp which
had Haiti had been a French Colony the
richest colony in the French Empire
large part of France's wealth derives
from
they imposed a severe Indemnity on Haiti
to punish them for daring to overthrow
uh
slavery Haiti had no choice had to pay
under this conditions of
Imperial
attack it wasn't until I don't I think
the 1940s that Haiti actually managed to
pay off the France ared when he was
president politely requested the French
to uh consider remunerating Haiti for
this immense burden that had strangled
the country after horrible French
colonialism and slavery French France
did establish a commission to look into
it headed by RIS
de leftist li de they decided that
France had no obligation
I mean all of this it gets so
unspeakable you can't you can't even say
what can't even talk about it everywhere
you look it's beyond
description the postc world war economic
and political settlement was said by
many to have had an idealistic thread
originally that was later subverted do
you agree with this there was an
idealistic thread in the 40s it shows up
most
strikingly in the
1948 Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was actually initiated by the
United States Elanor Roosevelt was the
leading figure pushing it but it had
very broad
participation uh direct participation
through in many parts of the world so it
was a joint Declaration of me all the
pretty much the whole world this could
be brought together and it's a pretty
forthcoming document especially if you
look at the
socioeconomic Rights Article
25 I mean it calls for things that we
ought to take for granted but that don't
exist every person should have the right
to a decent job to Health Care uh
to whatever makes life feasible there is
special provision for for women for
mothers after birth must be have they
must be cared for uh their children must
be cared for U well that was an idea
that was still the effect of the New
Deal Spirit which had some effects but
overall there was almost nothing
idealistic starting in they heard the
end of the war in the late late 40 44 or
45 uh there was a wave of radical
democracy that was spreading over the
world the
Depression was over maybe the war was
coming to an end Russia was defeating
the
Nazis Japanese imperialism had been
turned back there was a a lot of hope
that maybe we can move to a new world
which will be really just and honorable
the US wasn't having that when the the
US troops first entered Italy that's
where they entered the continent first
in 1944 us and British
troops Italy had been pretty much
liberated by the resistance the
partisans they had begun to establish a
u worker based worker on economy
especially in Northern Italy
the US dism and Britain dismantled it
restored the old
regime including the the king who had
supported the Nazis Victor monel
imposed
the what's his name it's Scapes me the
bolia the field Marshall who had been
responsible for the Ethiopian Invasion
he was put in fascist collab liberators
restored the old order was
restored same in Greece there was an
uprising in Greece British weren't
strong enough to control it Americans
moved
in maybe 150,000 people or so were
killed finally Stalin wasn't supporting
the gorillas he was living up to the
Ulta agreement which put this in the
British American Zone and they were
decimated and Greece was restored to
a quasi fascist order that's uh pretty
much the same happened in Western
Europe the old order was
reconstituted plenty of Nazi
Collaborators U some
interesting same thing was happening in
Japan
that's
um that's in 19
45 February
1945 the US was basically taking over
World governance from Britain Britain
had been the former Global hen and the
US was pushing the mide and taking over
first place to be concerned with was
Latin America that's our territory so
the in February 45 the United States
called a hemisphere conference in Latin
America where it imposed an economic
Charter for the
Americas which was opposed to economic
nationalism in all its forms there's a
background the state department was
deeply concerned with what they called
the I'm virtually quoting now the
philosophy of the New
Nationalism which calls for an equitable
distribution of resources for the
population and insists that the first
beneficiaries of a country's resources
should be the people of that
country none of that the first
beneficiaries are foreign
investors that was the economic Charter
for the Americas so Brazil was allowed
to produce steel but lowlevel steel that
didn't compete with with the high
quality us steel and so on that's the
back that's
45 the Britain Woods institutions in U
44 right before that had were kind of a
mixture they did establish a system in
which the US would be able to basically
have free economic penetration
and essentially
substantial political control over most
of the world but on the other hand they
did establish a an order economic order
which did Lay the basis for uh 20 25
years of quite substantial growth in
France it's called the con or is the 30
glorious years in the United States
economists call it the golden age of the
American economy fastest growth rate
egalitarian growth rate uh New Deal
Provisions were still in force there was
a business offensive already building up
to try to break it down but the business
offensive didn't really succeed until
the late 70s and the onset of the
neoliberal period during the which just
totally revers at all was
basically bitter class war you know go
into the details
but by International standards which are
not very elevated the Britain would
system was
moderately decent but the things like I
just talk about the ud Universal
declaration again through the subsequent
period
it was at least honored in
words by the time you get
to neoliberal years then I pretend so
Jean
Kirkpatrick Reagan's un Ambassador
dismissed the universal declaration as
what she called a letter to Santa Claus
she was talking about the socioeconomic
Provisions that's just a letter to Santa
Claus nobody can pay attention to this
nonsense the um human rights director
for the Reagan and Bush Administration
Paula do briansky said these things are
a myth we have to destroy the myth that
people have socio and economic rights
none of this Universal declaration
business um moris Abram who was the
delegate to the UN Commission on human
rights vetoed he was the Soul veto of
the UN resolution on right to
development basically article
25 said this is
pernicious destructive it's a dangerous
perversion we have to stop all of this
so by the time you get to neoliberalism
which was basically class war even in a
pretense of verbal pretense of honoring
these Provisions was gone U there and
that's part of the history of the
post-war period during the early years
there was
some remnant of the Social Democratic
new deal policies the aspirations for
more Justice and freedom but they were
under sharp attack which finally
succeeded and you get into the
neoliberal
period the Brittain Woods institutions
were pretty much undermined by Nixon
when he took the country off the gold
standard my book The racket looks at
many of the myths that the US uses to
project its power around the world one
of the main ones is that it practices
and promotes free trade is this true of
course not take a look at the World
Trade
Organization it's called that's the
centerpiece of what's called free
trade it's one of the most highly
protectionist trade agreements in
history what are called intellectual
property rights are exorbitant patent
restrictions of a Kind which had never
existed before if they had existed in
the 19th century the United States would
still be exporting fur and and
agricultural products no country could
possibly develop under those
restrictions which gave enormous patent
rights uh long 20year rights not just
process patents but even
product not just product but also
process patents meaning others can't
figure out better ways to make the same
uh
same product that's why pharmaceutical
prices
are
astronomical Way Beyond the cost of
production even though a lot of the
production is based on government uh
government research and government
funded and government develop
research in fact they're just investor
rights agreements and could go through
the details
there and in fact it's kind of
interesting to see how the US treats the
World Trade
Organization so um as you know the world
is strongly opposed to us sanctions
almost all of them the during the
Clinton years the sanctions on Cuba
which are utterly outrageous and the
whole world literally the whole world is
opposed to them you look at the votes at
the United Nations it's 184 to2 against
the sanctions us and Israel uh World
1996 Clinton sharply stepped up the
sanctions the Helms buron act Europe
which is very much opposed to the
sanctions brought the question to the
World Trade
Organization ask the World Trade
Organization remember that us sanctions
are third party sanctions everybody has
to obey them or else you're punished
severely so everybody hates them but
everyone obeys them uh Europe brought it
to the World Trade Organization to ask
for a judgment on the legality of the uh
sanctions Clinton administration was
outraged
they condemned the World Trade
Organization pulled out of the
negotiations steuart Eisen who was
Secretary of
Commerce wrote that uh the World Trade
Organization has no B interfering in
internal US policy which has been been
designed for 30 years to overthrow the
government of Cuba and they have no
right to interfere with this that's how
the US of course the case was drop us
pulls out it's drop so the treats the
World Trade Organization so it's not a
free that's the main I mean if you look
at NAFTA it's about the same you know
similar things the racket has a chapter
on the key role played by the US in
turkey's war on the Kurds and Israel's
war on the Palestinians can you describe
what the US role is in both those
conflicts yes I've been in both
places I visited jarak here shortly
after
the worst just at the period when the
worst Terror of the 1990s under the
Clinton Administration was subsiding so
you could at least travel around a
little the 90s I mean turkey the curds
of a awful history of Oppression I won't
run through the whole story the largest
kurd part of the Kurdish population in
Turkey where they've been bitterly
oppressed the oppression picked up
strongly in the
1990s Clinton years uh Clinton provided
the arms for it as the terror mounted
against first of all the the terror
against the Kurdish population was very
serious tens of thousands of people were
killed thousands of villages were in
towns were just wiped out hundreds of
thousands of people were driven into the
slums and
miserable living conditions in Istanbul
maybe you did I visited the places where
they live it's in
describable uh as the atrocities mounted
us Aid mounted by
1997 998 when the unities peaked the
United States the Clinton Administration
was providing about 80% of the Aid
Clinton spent provided I think in one
year
1998 he provided more Aid to the Turkish
military than the entire Coast War Cold
War period combined up to the onset of
the
Insurgency press refused to report it
New York Times had a bureau in Anchor of
course check and see almost not a
word it was certainly possible to find
out no secret about it was real
murderous Terror
it declined a little in the early years
of the this Century then picked up again
in around 2005 when uh aan took over
began to increase the repression now
it's pretty bad again not like the 90s
but bad and now it's extending
to the Syrian areas where the Kurds had
established
a pretty free Society in the midst of
the Calamity of the Syrian War but
turkey is attacking it us is looking the
other way uh as for Palestine I've been
there pretty
often I don't I think it I mean Israel's
for 50 years has been carrying out
a illegal brutal
occupation totally in violation of
international law and Security Council
resolutions uh the US has been providing
the arms uh if you read the isra the
Israeli press or it's the main newspaper
every day there's another crime in the
West Bank Gaza of course which I've also
visited is just a miserable prison and a
punching bag for his roof and they feel
like it they do what they call mowing
the lawn just let's bomb and kill a lot
of civilians and hit the hospitals and
so on and so
forth about there's a million children
two million population about a million
children in Gaza they can't get portable
water the even that power station
destroyed sewage station was destroyed
fishermen can't aren't allowed to go out
more than a couple of kilometers which
means they can't fish because of the
pollution it's just a horror story but
the West Bank too it's just daily crimes
what they call the settlers Hilltop
youth the IDF the armies watching them
Palestinians try to protect themselves
the Palestinians
or it's
um about the only place that resembles
it right now I think is Kashmir also
occupied by India uh illegally imposed
and sending Indian set lers and so on
very much on the Israeli model
so could Israel get away with it without
the
US not at all in the
1970s Israel made a fateful
decision it had to choose between
expansion and
security it's in the early' 70s the Arab
states uh Egypt Syria Jordan the three
neighboring Arab states were looking for
a way in the
conf there were resolutions introduced
in the security Council supported by
these three confrontation states which
called for
establishment of two states Israel
Palestine on the internationally
recognized border maybe with some
modifications with I'm now quoting it
guarantees for the right of each state
to exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized
borders that would
have given some kind of settlement not
beautiful but better than anything else
you can think of Israel was
infuriated refused to attend the
sessions Yak Robin who un representative
bitterly condemned the United Nations
for daring to move in this direction us
vetoed the
resolution uh well goes on from there
won't go to the details Israel basically
decided at this point it's going to
expand even at the expense of security
Now that has a
corollary relying on the United United
States you can't do that unless the most
powerful state in the world is going to
support you and that's what's happened
ever since the US has been backing it
all the way provides the uh Military
Support economic support U diplomatic
support huge flow of vetos in the
security Council votes at the general
assembly
you know 150 to2 that sort of thing
that when Trump came along he
just abandon any pretense Israel had
annexed the Golan Heights in violation
of Security Council orders and next
what's called Jerusalem which is in fact
five times as big as Jerusalem ever was
including Palestinian Villages also
against security Council orders Trump
simply said fine take them it's yours uh
Trump decided to punish the
Palestinians by removing the small
amount of Aid that the US was giving
humanitarian Aid because the
Palestinians weren't grateful enough to
him for selling him totally down the
river that's the Trump Administration
Biden's essentially P continued pretty
much with it soften some of the edges
uh that's uh that's been the what Israel
is doing is perfectly plain it's been
obvious for 50 years constructing a kind
of Greater
Israel which uh keeps Gaza in its
current state it uh um takes everything
that's of value in the West Bank and
integrates them into Israel so take over
the Jordan Valley pick out the
population on one or another pretext
it's about a third of the Arab
land imprisons the rest uh vastly
expanded Jerusalem taking in Palestinian
Villages towns to the east like
M each of them basically bisects the
livable part of what remains um
integrate all of this in subsidized
housing and nice suburbs in malim you
can live in a subsidized Villa there and
get to your job and Tel aiv and K
Jerusalem on a super highway in which
you never even see a Palestinian because
they're not allow uh the Palestinian
population concentrations are excluded
Israel doesn't want them it wants to
maintain a large Jewish majority in what
it can call a
Democratic state so Nablus is encircled
but it's not incorporated into what
Israel is taking over that's basically
greater Israel Palestinians who remain
in the territories that Israel is
occupying and taking over are cut off
into about 160 small enclaves surrounded
by Israeli soldiers which prevent people
even from going to their Olive Groves or
pasture their flock occasionally they'll
let them through but basically
imprisoned constant attacks by what are
called Hilltop youth right-wing mostly
religious settlers many from the United
States U that's life in the West Bank G
is almost unlivable in fact the
international
institutions conclude that Gaza will
literally will be unlivable in a few
years Golan Heights everybody's
forgotten about Syrian Goan
Heights and of course it couldn't be
done without strong us support there's a
whole section in the racket on us
poverty and inequality at home do you
think there's a link between the Empire
abroad and the war on the poor at home
in
America I don't think there's a direct
connection with imperialism abroad
uh these are basically separate matters
the neoliberal programs were designed as
I said they're basically class War I
mean officially if you look up the
definition it talks about markets and
small government and so on that's all
nonsense we've talked about markets U
same internal to the United States when
Reagan it started to build up during the
late Carter years but when took over and
Thatcher in England it just shot through
the roof and spread to the rest of the
world u u as far as free markets are
concerned Reagan opened the door to
financial speculation the financial
Industries grew enormously make a lot of
profit of course there's crashes they
rean the first the first couple of years
of the Reagan Administration I think
1984 they came the largest bank bail out
in American history rean bailed out the
Continental Illinois Bank uh bran
Administration ended with the Savings
and Loan crash had to bail out the
perpetrators then one crash after
another each time the friendly taxpayer
moves in and bails them out and it's not
just bailouts the it's
understood there's a phrase too big to
fail which means no matter what you do
no matter what crimes you commit
taxpayer bill you out that means they
get cheap credit High credit ratings
make risky Investments a lot of money
safe because you'll be bailed down
that's the market uh internally
externally we've already discussed uh
what about small government government's
grown grew on but it's grown to support
the rich and the corporate sector they
need protection and support it was a ren
Corporation Quai governmental
Corporation did a study of transfer of
wealth from the lower 90% of the
population working people middle class
transfer of wealth from them to the top
1% during the neoliberal years about 50
trillion that's pretty effective class
war you take a look at the Reagan
Administration prly doubled the debt
huge increase in the federal debt
because of tax cuts for the rich and
enormous military spending Trump also
blew a huge hole in the deficit with his
one legislative achievement 2017 tax cut
for Sharp tax cut for the rich and the
corporate sector the Republicans don't
care when they blow up the deficit and
the it's when the Democrats do it that
you get what you're seeing right now but
uh
that's real wages have pretty much
stagnated male real wages for
nonsupervisory workers or about what
they were in
1979 of course productivity's increased
wealth is increased but going into
different Pockets actually the Biden
years have seen a Improvement in the
situation of working
people contrary to what you read in the
headlines for working people it's been a
comparatively good
economy even for the lower paid who
doing better doesn't make up for the 40
45 years of destruction of Labor but um
slight Improvement uh Republicans are
going to try to break any any anything
that contributes to that they're opposed
to strongly they've stopped being a
parliamentary party a long time ago
they're just in abject service to wealth
and corporate power
and
but the um I think the
Imperial uh atrocities and the internal
domestic repression are not really
closely connected they're just parallel
developments there's something that lies
behind them of course making sure that
the world and the domestic economy are
operating to the benefit
of the very rich and the corporate
sector that's a
commonality I went to Honduras a key
part of the US so-called War on Drugs
for the book can you describe what the
reality of the US War on Drugs is well
Honduras has been
a it was
the almost paradigmatic banana state
owned by the United Fruit Company
working people miserably repressed huge
profits for the company
small Rich Elite called sometimes the 14
families very rich they cooperate with
foreign imperialist powers and enrich
themselves that
standard uh during the
1980s Honduras was turned into
a an armed Camp basically it was the
base for the US attack against
Nicaragua uh which in incidentally the
US was condemned for at the world court
and told them to get lost just like it
tells the World Trade Organization to
get lost
uh it continued that way until a couple
of years ago 2008 when a moderately
reformist president mils Alia started to
begin to reverse the process he was
overthrown in a military coup kicked out
of the country uh C was harshly
condemned by almost the entire world one
exception the Obama
Administration Obama and Clinton refused
to call it a military
coup because if they had by law they
would have had to stop military aid to
the hunter so therefore they said it's
not a military coup it's just an
internal um change of some kind the
military Hunter ranana totally
fraudulent election also condemned by
Latin America and the world except for
Obama and Clinton Hillary Clinton who
said it's a wonderful step towards
democracy and so on I mean all of this
is so familiar in the history of Latin
America hesitate even to report it the
hunda was introduced be introduced a
regime of torture Terror Honduras
became maybe the homicide capital of the
world people started fleeing from
hondura Honduras the Caravans the famous
Caravans were based in
Honduras us of course kicked him out got
Mexico to kick him out drive him back
home uh the drug war is part of it we
might ask what the drug war is the drug
war is in the United States demand is in
the United States the arms too that the
military uses say in Mexico to attack
the
cartels um or that the cartels
themselves use the arms that the cartel
uses to kill tens of thousands of people
they come from where I live in Arizona I
mean I don't know which end of a gun to
hold but I could walk into a gun store
pick up a rifle um hand it over to the
local representative of the cartel he go
down to Mexico with it and start killing
people it's not everything but it's a
lot of it uh the Colombia which is maybe
Mexico is Horst or Colombia has been one
of the worst cases
paramilitaries connected the government
uh carry out major atrocities is all
closely connected to the drug
cartels I've I visited Southern Columbia
peasant
areas um you go to a remote Village pass
a place on the side of the road where
there's white
crosses people killed by the
paramilitaries when they were trying to
drive in a in a bus you know uh the
there's the program of what's called
fumigate
us fumigation essentially chemical
warfare it's supposed to destroy opium
destroys everything U doesn't
discriminate uh you see kids with
horrible boils and many die and so on
it's
a and there's a background to this if
you go back to the 1970s before the
neoliberal period
take a look at incarceration rates in
the United
States they were fairly high but within
the spectrum of Western
societies now they're five to 10 times
as high a lot of that is the effect of
the drug war why has there been more
crime and why is it happening the drug
war took off with
Nixon but Nixon by contemporary
standards was quite liberal and human
believe it or not so if you look at
Nixon's drug war it had a substantial
component for prevention and
treatment now there have been studies
ran Corporation others of just cost
benefit analysis of modes of dealing
with drugs by far the most effective and
least costly is prevention and treatment
next most expensive is police action
more expensive less less
effective more expensive than that and
still less effective is border
control worst of all most expensive
least effective is what are called outof
country
operations like supporting
paramilitaries in Colombia and chemical
warfare you look at policies
virtually the opposite of the
recommendations by now almost nothing
for prevention and treatment which is
the only effective way and it's a way to
control the population here and it's
devastating for Latin America uh but the
drug war is centered here let's see now
you find right-wing Congressman saying
we have to invade Mexico to stop fentel
production
ction how about treating the source of
the problem here not invading Mexico not
sending them guns not not fumigating
their Colombian
territory it's it's just another major
crime I also went to Egypt and Tunisia
soon after the revolutions there in 2011
do you find Hope in what happened
there there was hope in Tunisia and
Egypt the Arab Spring
socalled pretty much started in
Tunisia Egypt's the most important
country of course and it picked up in
Egypt and for the first couple of months
there was real hope that something would
change they could overthrow the
dictatorships the dictator of Tunisia
had to flee the country uh the United
States supported the Egyptian dictator
Mubarak about as long as it was possible
to do so some point the Army and the
business World turned against him so the
US did too Army took
over instituted the harshest murderous
dictatorship in Egypt's
history
U Trump's said that Ali he described the
dictator as his favorite dictator strong
WR us support all the way um it's
U I'm I'm sorry to be so gloomy and
harsh but you want to ask those
questions I don't see any alternative
Tunisia
unfortunately it did have
a moderately Progressive democratic
government it's collapsing in this case
on internal grounds the elected leaders
turn themselves into a
autocrat is breaking down Democratic
structures restoring a kind of
dictatorship freedom I notice I have
another talk in five minutes I'm gonna
have to switch over okay thanks so much
