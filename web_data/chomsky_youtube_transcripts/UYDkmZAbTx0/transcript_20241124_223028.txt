with the international peace bureau and
the campaign for peace disarmament and
common security uh and it's absolutely
my pleasure to be uh introducing uh noam
chomsky a man who needs obviously no
introduction
uh but who i think is is uh
everyone
is aware and has enormous respect for
gnom's many many contributions
uh
he is really one of the foremost social
critics
and political critics not only the u.s
policy but really at a global level uh
and his work as a philosopher and as one
of the founders of of modern linguistics
i'm going to get out of the way here
and gnome the floor is yours
should i get started
it was
my
great pleasure and privilege
to have been able to take part in the
early
meetings of the
world social forum
20 years ago
porto alegre
memorable
exciting occasions
and much the same
to be with you
today
if
only virtually
to my great regret
well the years pass
and the issues remain
just becoming more urgent
more unavoidable
for 20 years the
motto of the
world social forum
has been
that another world is possible
that remains true
cannot be forgotten
but as we meet today
that question is overshadowed by another
one
is this world possible
and the answer is
no
this world is not possible
this world is hurtling to
self-annihilation
and only creation of another world
can reverse this course
luckily
another world is still possible
though the chances of achieving it
are diminishing
at an ominous rate
this world
has been
on a slow course
towards self-annihilation
for a long time
but there have been
inflection points
where the course the destruction
was accelerated
one of them
is a day that has been
indelibly
etched into my own memory
also others too of
my generation
august 6
1945.
on that day
i happened to be
at a summer camp
where i was a counselor
in the morning
the loudspeaker announced that the
united states had
destroyed hiroshima with an atomic bomb
there was some cheering
and everyone went off happily
to their next activity
swimming
baseball
whatever it might be
a little later i was able to pick up
some newspapers
and found that the general reaction
was much the same
uh cheering that the war was over
and then on to the next activity
carried a
double lesson
one lesson was that
human intelligence
and its glory
had devised means for
self-annihilation
the second lesson is that
human intelligence had not developed the
moral capacity
to comprehend
what it is doing
and to control
its death wish
to be precise it's not just annihilation
of our own species
we are also
bringing down
much of life with us
beetles and bacteria should
do all right and there's a further
qualification
human intelligence had not yet
reached that four
but it was apparent that it soon would
and it did
in 1953
when the united states and then the
soviet union
exploded
thermonuclear weapons
the capacity to destroy everything
great achievement
putting these qualifications aside let's
go back to the essential lesson
human
technical and scientific intelligence
vastly outstripped
human moral intelligence
the capacity to destroy
is not matched by the ability to
understand what we are doing
and to change
course those who see the
stark resemblance to today
are not mistaken
there were some
who did understand
what we were doing
and the need to change course
among them were the scientists
who established the
bulletin of atomic scientists
and the famous doomsday clock
with the hand said
a certain distance from midnight
midnight means
termination
of the human experiment on earth
the clock provides a kind of measure
of the gap between
technical
and moral intelligence
the clock was first set
in 1947
seven minutes to midnight
in 1953
with the explosion of
hydrogen bombs
the minute hand was moved forward to two
minutes to midnight
since then
it's oscillated
reflecting analyses of the
world situation
it did not reach
two minutes again
until the trump years
in his last year in office
the analysts abandoned the minutes
switched to seconds
100 seconds to midnight
that's where the clock stands now
next january
it'll be set again
and
wouldn't surprise me if it moves closer
to termination
in
1945
it was not known
that another inflection point
was coming
poisoning of the atmosphere
and a new geological epoch
what geologists call the anthropocene
an epic in which
human activity
radically
influences the global climate
and not to its benefits
well add another
personal
attitude
i
learned how serious this was
50 years ago
when
in
one one single week
i received phone calls from
two friends
one was the chair of earth sciences
at harvard
the other was the
head of meteorology at mit
both of them informed me
of new evidence
that it just appeared
that co2 levels in the atmosphere
were sharply accelerating
and that we were heading towards
catastrophe
well
as we all
now know
the dread news
was also
well known
to the executives
of the fossil fuel companies
their scientists in fact were in the
lead
in
researching these matters
and exposing
the grim consequences
the response of the executives
was to accelerate the destruction
and to kill any threat
that the population
might understand their grim fate
some of these steps towards
annihilation
are not as well known as they should be
they're instructive
one important case
is what happened to the republican party
which will
soon be taking power in the united
states
so it appears
perhaps
virtually permanent power
if it's quite open efforts to
undermine american democracy
succeed
the party is
100 percent denialist
a matter of extraordinary significance
this was not always the case
and the transition
tells us something
about the institutions that humans have
constructed
and about the challenges
they pose to survival
let's go back to 2008
election year
the republican candidate for president
was john mccain
he had a climate flank
in his program
not very much but something
republican legislators were
also
beginning to
consider similar efforts
well
as soon as the huge
koch brothers
energy conglomerate
got wind of this
they leaped into action
for years
they had been working hard
to ensure
that republicans
fully supported
free use of fossil fuels
and they were not going to tolerate
this deviation from
subordination to their interests
they launched a huge
juggernaut
bribery of congress
threats
massive lobbying
fake citizens groups
no stone left unturned
in no time
all republican leaders capitulated
in the last
republican primary that's 2016
every candidate
either denied that global warming is
happening or said
maybe it is
but we're not going to do anything about
it
the victor donald trump
went all out in maximizing the use
of fossil fuels including the most
destructive of them
and dismantling
regulations that might protect the
environment
of course he also
pulled out of the international effort
to address the crisis
donald trump
owns the party
which is very likely
coming back to
total control of the government
this is not andorra
this is the government of the most
powerful country in human history
and that's not
a joke for our
sad world
well one effect of the
treachery of leadership
is that among republicans and those
who lean republican
only 20 percent
regard global warming as a top priority
it's only the most
critical problem that humans have ever
faced
along with nuclear war
so why pay attention
so our leaders and their
media echo temp chamber
tell us
actually global warming
has been
factored into the setting of the
doomsday clock in recent years
along with a third factor
the deterioration
of the domain of rational discourse
which offers the only hope
for escape from catastrophe
the example of the
fossil fuel companies
may be misleading
they're simply following
normal capitalist principles
principles that
adam smith
described 250 years ago
what he pointed out is
that the masters of mankind
he meant
the merchants and manufacturers of
england
the masters of mankind have always
followed
the vile maxim
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else
adam smith
the masters do not pursue the maxim
because they are
particularly evil
it's an institutional imperative
those who don't adopt the maxim
are displaced
by those who do
that's the essence
of the unregulated market
which is a death warrant
for the human species
and also for the
collateral damage among
the rest of life on earth
uncontrolled markets are a death warrant
for other reasons
they were discussed
over a century ago by
the great political economist
thurstein viblin
he pointed out that success in the
market
requires
fabricating wants
stimulating the consumerism
that is destroying the planet
and in fact destroying decent lives
so
one can think of better ways to spend
one's time than
fuming with irritation in an
endless traffic jam
huge industries
are devoted
to
inducing us to adopt such a lifestyle
not the better world that is possible
with institutions devoted to human need
rather than to
private profit
and destruction of the environment
that sustains life so here we are
contemplating human intelligence
it has contrived
effective means of self-annihilation
it's constantly toying with their use
right now in fact
it's also devised
social institutions
that are a death warrant
and it has so far
failed to close the yawning gap
between the capacity to destroy
and the capacity to create
that other world
that is possible
and that's where the world social forum
comes into the picture
its task is to close that gap
we know
what must be done
we know
how to rid the world
of nuclear weapons
at the very least
to reconstruct the arms control regime
that the republican party
has been dismantling
for 20 years
and to carry this regime forward
towards elimination of this scourge
we know how to do that
there are also
detailed
quite feasible proposals as to how to
overcome the climate crisis
and to move on to a much better life
there's even a resolution in congress
u.s congress
sponsored by
alexandria ocasio-cortez
young representative who was
swept into office on the
bernie sanders wave
joined by
ed markey
senior senator
with a long record of concern about
destruction of the environment
the resolution
is worth reading
it spells out
an extensive detail
a sensible
and feasible approach to ending the
crisis
and opening the way
to a much more livable world
it's not the only such program you can
read them
on the international energy
agency which is
based on the energy corporations
because several economists including my
colleague robert holland have worked out
detailed proposals
all pretty much similar
they can be implemented
right now in congress it's just a
resolution
with enough intense
popular effort
could become legislation
and be enacted
same is true in other countries
the window of opportunity is brief
and closing
but it's still there
changing
lethal social institutions
is a greater challenge
but it's also
one that can be met
with dedicated effort
so we know how
but can it be achieved
the answer is in your hands
and the hands of others like you
we might
place this question
in a broader context
you are all i'm
presumed
familiar with uh
physicist aaron and enrico fermi's
famous paradox
in brief
where are they
he's a distinguished astrophysicist
knew that there were a huge number of
planets
within the reach of
potential contact
that have the conditions to sustain life
and higher intelligence
but with the most assiduous search
we can find
no trace of their existence
so where are they
well one response that has been
seriously proposed
and cannot be dismissed
is that higher intelligence
has indeed developed innumerable times
but it is proven to be lethal
it discovered the means for
self-annihilation
but did not develop
the moral capacity
to prevent it
that's a possibility
that certainly
cannot be ignored
well
right now
uh maybe it's even
an inherent property
of what we call higher intelligence
we're now engaged in an experiment
to determine
whether this grim principle
holds of modern humans
us
we're
a recent arrival on
earth two or three hundred thousand
years ago
it's a flick of an eye
in evolutionary time
there's not much time to find the answer
more precisely
to determine the answer
to determine the answer
something we will do
one way or the other
no other possibility
the challenge is
unique in human history
it will be met now
for we are doomed
not to die all at once
but doomed to a world in which
those who do die
will be the lucky ones
the solutions are there
waiting for us
waiting for us to close the gap
between our
capacity to
destroy and our will to create the
better world
that is possible
that's the challenge
we cannot avoid it
