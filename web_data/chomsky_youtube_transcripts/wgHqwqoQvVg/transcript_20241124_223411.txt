[Applause]
uh sometimes the attacks on education
and the common good are very closely
linked there's a current illustration
she's pretty
striking uh several one of them is the
What's called the environmental literacy
Improvement act which is now being
proposed to state legislator by uh Alec
that's the American legislative exchange
Council it's a corporate funded Lobby
tremendous wealth that designs
legislation to serve the needs of the
corporate sector and the at extreme
wealth and has been quite influential
well this particular act which is just
now being proposed the environmental
literacy Improvement act uh mandates
what they call balanced teaching of
climate science in K to 12
classrooms uh balance teaching as you
probably know is a code word it refers
to teaching climate change denial that's
to balance uh authentic climate science
that's stuff you read in science
journals uh
uh other serious Publications and uh
legislation based on this uh these Alec
models have already been introduced in
several States will probably be
instituted soon since soon uh this uh
alak legislation is based on a project
of the Heartland Institute that's a
corporate funded Institute which is
dedicated to rejection of the scientific
consensus on uh what's happening to the
climate uh The
Institute has a project which calls for
in their words a global warming
curriculum for K to2 classrooms and its
aim I'm quoting from it is to teach that
there's a major controversy over whether
or not humans are changing the weather
of course all this is dressed up and uh
rhetoric about teaching critical
thinking and also sorts of nice things
it's very similar and parallel in fact
to the current assault on teaching
children about Evolution and about
science quite generally all of that has
to be balanced with the Raging
controversies and there is indeed a
controversy uh on one side is the
overwhelming majority of scientists all
of the world's greatest nationaly of
science Sciences uh the professional
societies of science the professional
science journals the uh IPC PCC the
intergovernmental panel on climate
change the general grouping of
scientists that deals with this they all
agree that global warming is taking
place that there's a substantial human
component that the situation is serious
and quite possibly dire and that very
soon maybe within decades the wor the
world might reach a kind of a Tipping
Point when the process will escalate
sharply and will be
irreversible the end of Life as we know
it very severe uh effects on the
possibility of decent human survival
actually it's very rare to find uh such
overwhelming scientific consensus on
complex scientific issues like this now
it's true that it's not unanimous there
is a controversy and the media commonly
reports uh presents a a a controversy
between the overwhelming scientific
consensus the National Institutes of
science science journals and so on on
the one side and also SK on the other
side Skeptics actually among the
Skeptics there are a few to quite
respected scientists who caution that uh
there's a lot that's unknown which is
correct the fact that there's a lot
that's unknown means that things might
not be as bad as the consensus claims or
they might be it might be a lot worse
that's what it means to say that uh much
is not known but only the first
alternative is ever brought up uh and
there's something omitted from this
contrive debate actually there's
actually a much larger group of Skeptics
among scientists highly regarded climate
s climate scientists who regard the
regular reports of uh the ipcc as much
too
conservative includes for example the
climate change study group at my own
University at
MIT and they've repeatedly been proven
correct over the year years the con
census apparently is too conservative
things are much worse uh but they're
scarcely part of the public debate at
all although they're very prominent in
the scientific literature as you can
find if you read the science journals
well the Heartland Institute and Alec
are part of a huge campaign by corporate
lobbies to so doubt about the near
unanimous consensus of scientists that
human activity ities are having a major
impact on global warming uh with perhaps
ominous consequences and not that far
off the campaign is not a secret was
openly announced publicly announced uh
including the lobbying organizations of
the fossil fuel industry American
Chamber of Commerce the major business
Lobby and others it's had a certain
effect on public opinion
uh so public opinion in the United
States is not quite as concerned about
the dangers of U what we're doing to the
climate as in other comparable countries
uh but actually a careful studies show
that public opinion remains much closer
to the scientific consensus than policy
is which is an interesting fact and
that's undoubtedly why major sectors of
the corporate world are launching their
attack on the educational system to try
to counter the tendency of uh the public
to pay attention to the conclusions of
serious scientific
research uh you probably heard that at
the Republican National uh committee's
winter meeting few few weeks ago
Governor Bobby Jindal warned the
Republican
leadership as he put it that we must
stop being the stupid party we must stop
insulting the intelligence of Voters
actually Alec and its corporate back
backers have a different view they want
the country to be the stupid nation and
maybe if it is they'll even join the
stupid party that Jindal warned about uh
the major scientific journals give a
very clear sense of how surreal all of
this is now what it would look like to
an observer say watching what's going on
on Earth and in fact what it does look
like in other countries so take U
Science magazine the major science
weekly Journal of the American
Association for the advancement of
science uh couple of weeks ago it had
three news items side by side
one of them reported that the year 2012
was the hottest year on record in the
United States with all kind
of harm harmful consequences all over
the country drought hurricanes all sorts
of things and as I pointed out this is
continuing a long Trend the second study
second news item reported a news study
by the United States global climate
change research program which provided
some new evidence for Rapid climate
change as result of human activities and
also discussed likely severe impacts the
third news item reported the new
appointments to chair the Committees on
science policy chosen by the House of
Representatives where uh a minority of
Voters elected a large majority of
Republicans thanks to the shredding of
the democratic system in recent years uh
in Pennsylvania as you probably know a
considerable majority voted for house
for democrats for the house but they won
barely over a third of the House Seats
well so now we have there three science
committees uh all of the three chairs
did deny that humans contribute to
climate change two of the three chairs
deny that climate change is even taking
place and one of them uh who denies
everything is also a
longtime Advocate lobbyist for the
fossil fuel industry uh the same issue
of the journal has a detailed technical
article which provides new evidence that
the irreversible Tipping Point Point may
be ominously
close uh that's a picture of what's
going on and the context in which the
Alec effort is being introduced to
ensure that we become the stupid Nation
uh uh for those who Adam Smith called
the masters of mankind it's very
important that we become the stupid
nation in the interests of their
short-term profits damn the consequences
that's the conception of the common good
that they want to
Institute these are essential properties
of reigning contemporary
doctrines sometimes called Market
fundamentalist doctrines uh inherent in
these doctrines that you have to have
these things going on uh Alec and its
corporate sponsors uh understand the
importance of ensuring that public
education ation train children to belong
to the stupid nation and not to be
misled by science and
rationality well what I mentioned is not
the only Case by far of pretty sharp
Divergence between public opinion and
public
policy that's important it tells us a
lot about the state of current American
democracy and what it means for us and
in fact for the world the corporate
assault on education and independent
thought of which this incident is only
one striking illustration that tells us
a good deal
more uh it's turned to policy in climate
policy the US which is the richest
country in the world with enormous
advantages uh lags Bey behind other
countries quot a current scientific
review 109 countries have enacted some
form of policy regarding Renewable Power
and 118 countries have set targets for
renewable energy in contrast the United
States has no adop has not adopted any
consistent and stable set of policies at
the national level to Foster the use of
renewable energy it's a current article
or for that that matter has the US
adopted uh other means that are pursued
by countries that have National policies
that means virtually
everyone uh some things are being done
but sporadically and with no organized
National commitment uh which makes them
fairly ineffective now that's not a
slight problem for us uh for your
children grandchildren maybe not too far
off and for the world in the light of uh
the great predominance of American power
uh indeed it is declining has been for a
long time as power is becoming more
Diversified internationally but it's
still completely without challenge it's
also worth mentioning that there are
sectors of the world population that are
really in the lead uh in trying to do
something about these very dire
consequences it's throughout the world
it's the remnants of the indigenous
populations that's true just about
everywhere whether they tribal societies
First Nations aboriginals whatever
they're called they're
the they're the leaders worldwide and
trying to uh Force some attention to
these extremely grave matters actually
it's the first time in human history
that humans have been
on the verge of destroying themselves
and it's not too far off uh in the
countries that have substantial
indigenous populations either majority
or near majority of the countries
themselves have taken very strong
measures Bolivia which has an indigenous
majority and Ecuador near majority have
U
legislation uh to preserve the rights of
nature as it's called Uh in Ecuador
which has substantial oil deposits there
are efforts by the government under
pressure from the indigenous population
to leave the oil in the ground in fact
now they're the government's attempting
to get some support from the European
Union I don't think they're approaching
the United States uh to subsidize them
in leaving the oil underground so that
it won't destroy all of us we're doing
the opposite in fact right here in
Pennsylvania uh get it to be used as
quickly as possible so it can be as
harmful as possible to Future
generations and to the world going in
and the same is true of indigenous
populations elsewhere uh India there
practically a war over at Colombia
Australia wherever you go Canada the
indigenous population are trying hard to
save the human species while the
educated civilized sector of the world
is trying to destroy the human
species very uh interesting topic I mean
I I I think I mentioned that in Ecuador
where there's a large indigenous
population they have it's not to not be
fracking they have plenty of oil
reserves and there is uh there are
efforts by the government not to use the
oil keep it in the ground because the
understanding of the indigenous
population is we're better off if we
don't use it because every bit of it
that we use harms us harms our children
it harms the world and maybe severe harm
so one possibility is to take the stand
of say the indigenous uh tribes in
Ecuador and same much around the world
the other is to take the stand on which
say Obama and Romney completely
agreed let's get all the O oil the
hydrocarbons that are underground huge
quantities let's use them all as
efficiently as possible it'll give us a
100 Years of energy
Independence uh what's the world going
to look like in a 100 years that's
somebody else's problem what's important
is uh how much money I can make tomorrow
you know incident the oil Independence
issue is almost totally meaningless I
mean if all of our oil came from say
Saudi
Arabia we'd have no more dependence than
we have today uh you can easily see that
in the US policies towards uh the Middle
East say were exactly the same in the
1950s under Eisenhower when we didn't
take get any oil from the Middle East in
fact we were the biggest oil exporter
and the us at that time in the
1950s uh initiated a
program to exhaust domestic oil in the
interests of profits for Texas oil
producers so to use domestic oil Texas
oil instead of Cheaper Saudi oil because
Texas oil producers would make more
profit and then we'd have big holes in
the ground which we could fill in call
later calling them the Strategic energy
Reserve but the policies towards
controlling the Middle East controlling
Middle East oil were the same so uh
forget the energy Independence issue the
real issue is uh do we want the
consequences of extracting as
hydrocarbons natural gas and oil to the
maximum extent possible well you can
figure out what the consequences are so
it takes a fracking I it has a lot of
local effects you know I'm sure you all
know about this it harms Water Supplies
toxic effects it's very energy intensive
fra natural gas is H more is more
efficient than oil you know less CO2 but
it also releases methane which is worse
than CO2 and it's energy intensive to
extract it but there are other effects
like the Eon you know the economic
arguments are that a fra
fracking and shift to natural gas will
give us a transition
period uh in which we'll have cheap
energy which will enable us to
transition to renewable energies okay so
therefore it's it's a couple of problems
with that namely it has the opposite
effect the main one it has the opposite
effect if you have cheap
hydrocarbons in a capitalist Society
there's going to be no incentive intive
to develop Renewables so the more cheap
hydrocarbons you have the longer you put
off the time until we begin to do what
we've got to do if we want to survive uh
turn to Renewables and what is being
done in other countries I mentioned that
out of 110 countries us is the only one
that doesn't have a national energy
policy you look elsewhere countries are
doing various things like in Ecuador I
told you what they're doing try to keep
the oil in the ground uh in China which
is a huge polluter but it's also by now
in the lead uh internationally in solar
energy it's producing Mo most of the
solar panels and advanced solar panels
most the high Hightech Advanced
sophisticated solar panels so they're
ahead in the technology and they're in
ahead in the scale we've fallen behind
Germany and Denmark are
pretty much switching to Renewables
they're rich countries so there are
plenty of things that can be done one of
them is to try to maximize the damage uh
and to put off as long as possible the
step towards trying to repair it uh
which may mean putting it off until it's
all over uh and that's what the fracking
is and that's the national consensus
from Obama to Romney and everyone in
between that's a I think that's
pathological
[Music]
frankly
