my name is Nica AKA Socrates and you're
watching Singularity one1 Singularity
oneone is a regular podcast feature of
sing ularity web blog where you can go
and listen to it or download it in full
today my guest on the show would be F
linguist political activist prolific
author and public speaker Dr Noom
chumsky Dr chumsky thank you so much for
being with us today pleased to be with
you fantastic so my goal here today is
to hopefully ask you a few questions
that perhaps you don't get to be asked
very often so uh let's Jump Right In in
our very limited time here with this one
imagine that you meet a person who has
never heard of you before and they ask
you to introduce yourself and what you
do how would you do that in a couple of
sentences i' say um I teach it MIT I've
been there for 60 years I so my main
work is in on
language cognition thinking
philosophy uh I also have another life
in which I'm a political activist and
writer on contemporary
Affairs social and political issues
historical questions and so on so two
lives is there a dominant life there one
takes over the other or are they kind of
Fairly
balanced depends on the period depends
on what's Happening the political life
tends to be more urgent they're urgent
issues all the time so that tends to
take
priority you have been at MIT for about
60 years perhaps uh and among other
things MIT is very famous for research
in artificial intelligence what in your
view is artificial intelligence and what
are our chances of ever creating
it well it's a strange notion I mean in
a certain sense what I do is artificial
intelligence
the uh what the term is usually used for
is the effort to
program um machines maybe computers
maybe robots so as
to mimic or approximate certain aspects
of human
behavior uh that can be understood as a
scientific project namely trying like
you might try to construct a model of
the Say insect navigation try to
understand insect navigation better or
could be as an effort to produce
something of
utility like a robot that will clean
your house for you uh and those those
are basically the two thrusts of
artificial
intelligence they do not uh the work in
the fields now about also about 60 years
has not
really given any insight into the nature
any to speak of into the nature of
thought and organization of action and
so on and I don't think that's very
surprising even to understand insect
navigation is extremely difficult in
fact even to understand how the neuron
of a giant squid
distinguishes food from danger even
that's a very difficult problem to try
to capture
the nature of say human intelligence or
human choice is a colossal problem Way
Beyond the limits of of contemporary
science so if it is a colossal problem
does that mean it's
insurmountable we don't know we never
know how much how far science can reach
human beings are organic creatures we're
not angels and there's a it's generally
believ often believe that humans can
solve any problem but that would be true
only if we were Angels since we're
organic creatures like all others we
have certain uh capacities and the
capacities have scope and they also have
limits and the scope and the limits are
tightly related if we didn't have limits
we wouldn't have scope the limits
determine what kind of of a cognitive
creature we are and that gives us the
capacity to explore to inquire and
create in certain ways but not
necessarily in others there may well be
problems that are simply beyond our
comprehension and in fact in the history
of Science and philosophy there are
quite interesting examples that have
come
up now this may be a very long uh
Journey uh and you have been in the past
very critical of the approaches taken by
uh many or most uh of the uh researchers
working in the field of artificial uh
intelligence would it be fair to say uh
do you think that AI research is still
heed in the wrong direction in your
view well some of the leading
researchers in the field including some
colleagues of mine do believe and have
said that the
pressure to
create commercially viable and useful
devices to achieve certain ends has
somewhat overt overcome the field and
driven the more science oriented aspects
of it into the margins and I suspect
that that's correct uh actually if you
look at the what I call the science
oriented Parts like the say analogous to
developing a model V navigation that's
the kind of work that I and many others
do it's not called artificial
intelligence but it's basically an
effort to develop a theoretical
understanding of the nature of
fundamental elements of human
intelligence and human cognitive
capacity happens to be primarily on
language which is Central to many such
much of which makes us human but the
same would be true of people studying
vision or children's acquisition of
concept
or other problems of the choice
and the conditions under which it's
undertaken and reasoning and so on so in
other words it seems that you think that
projects such as for example the Google
autonomous self-driving car or ibms
Watson have kind
of hijacked the research to to produce
other uh products like those and and and
are are in that way costing the research
into the more proper artificial
intelligence it's not a question of more
proper but if what you want to do like I
have nothing against self-driving cars
yeah that' be make it easy to park my
car so fine they want to do that it's
okay just like I have nothing against
bigger bulldozers they're probably
better uh so applied work to achieve
some humanly sensible goal was perfectly
fine neither right nor wrong uh Watson I
think a somewhat different story I think
that's mainly a PR gimmick frankly I
don't see what's achieved by the except
for maybe selling computers by showing
that if you spend a lot of time packing
say take say a deep
blue I mean it was perfectly obvious 60
years ago that sooner or later if you
get 50 Grand Masters together to plan to
take as much time as they want planning
strategies for more you know imaginable
occasions the sooner or later that'll
reach a point where they can do better
uh in
their than a particular single grandmas
who's restricted to say 45 minutes I
that's almost obvious from the nature of
the game so having done it shows nothing
except that you you did what is known
could be done nothing is learned from it
uh in fact this was uh pretty well
understood by the founder of the field
Alan Turing great mathematician who
was also the one of the founders of
computer science but he did write a
famous paper back around
1950 on can machines think some title
like that a very short paper I think
it's eight pages and that basically set
off the field of artificial intelligence
they're still to this day are prizes
every year for $100,000 or something
like that if you can pass What's called
the touring test he called it his
imitation
game however um touring in that paper
did point out has a sentence in which he
says the question whether machines can
think is too meaningless to deserve
discussion so let's put that
aside no no talk about thinking Machines
of course machine here means program it
doesn't mean the computer on the
physical object under your desk it means
the program that's written for it that's
what the term machine means so the
question whether the program in your
computer can think is too meaningless to
deserve discussion and he's quite right
it is so but nevertheless thought that
this was a useful project for two
reasons one he said it might be an in
passing the imitation game test you
what's called the touring test might be
an incentive to construct better
machines and I suppose that's could be
true about deep loop I don't know the
details but it's possible that in
constructing deep flu some ideas were
developed about how to create bigger
memories or more accessible memories and
so on if so it's fine it's like B bulldo
uh but he also said that he
thought
maybe in he said in 50 years which is
passed uh we would change our concept of
thinking well that hasn't happened and I
don't expect it to happen in the
foreseeable future we haven't gained
that kind of insight into the nature of
whatever it is that goes on and thinking
so so you believe that Watson
has symbolized no progress or embodied
no progress whatsoever I mean one
potential application that's been
trumpeted lately in the media was the
medical applications in
Diagnostics uh where Watson would be uh
supposedly much more accurate than any
number of uh experienced uh doctors from
a number of variety of fields and
thereby would potentially democratize
Medicine by uploading uh the what Watson
in the cloud and then allowing access to
its uh knowledge or to its uh
Diagnostics ability via a simple
smartphone for example anywhere in the
world oh that's fine that's uh have
certainly no objection to that just like
uh developing surgical techniques which
change say a gallbladder operation from
something that used to hospitalize
person for a week to something you can
do walk in walk into the office and walk
out that's great and if collecting a lot
of
data what you're referring to is a
system that collects a lot of data has a
rapid search procedure and uh so that
can discover partic an algorithm that
enable it to discover particular things
in the data that's fine you know it's
like a it's like a program that searches
a document to find a word you're looking
for I have no objection to that in fact
I think it's a nice idea but that's
different from understanding something
about the nature of diagnosis let's say
it's not telling you that it's simply
accumulating the understanding that has
been achieved and running through it
rapidly
and
comprehensively more so than say a
single individual can do in particular
individual without much
training so for example some like when I
look at an x-ray I don't see anything if
a trained radiologist looks at it they
see something now it's conceivable that
whatever a trained radiologist is doing
could be
programmed uh in such a way that I could
put put it into my computer and then it
would enable me to see what the trained
radiologist is see that's fine that
could be useful not for me but for for a
doctor somewhere is not a train
radiologist but what about everything
else that that train radiologist is
doing is it not conceivable that we can
program uh that everything else that
they're doing could be potentially
programmable one way or
another just as it's
perfectly possible that robots can
replace human labor on assembly lines if
they can it's fine freeze humans up to
do more creative things and is isn't
that the sign of progress in some sense
or another it's a sign if it depends
what it's used for say for let's take
robots on assembly lines if it's used to
free up the workforce for more creative
work say say controlling production
making decisions about it uh finding
creative ways to act and so on then it's
to the good if it's used as a device to
maximize profit and throw people into
the trash can then it's not good I hope
I have the chance to come back on that
topic a little later but let me just
rush through here and ask you what's
the what's the importance of reverse
engineering the human brain is perhaps
arguably way of getting insights into
making more progress for artificial
intelligence as for example another
famous alumni of MIT Ray kurtwell most
notably
argues well Ray kurtwell made some
useful devices and he's a future what's
called a futurologist he develops
elaborate speculations about what might
happen uh if people find that
stimulating okay I don't particularly
but I don't
see any particular achievement there
other than creating the devices that are
useful that's fine maybe a speech
analysis device I me let me just tell
you a personal story when I was
appointed at MIT in 1955 almost 60 years
ago uh I basically had no recognized
profession but I was U they were willing
to appoint me at in the research lab El
ronics to work on a program on machine
translation uh in my interview with the
director of the
laboratory Jerome weasner uh we talked
about the work I was doing talked about
the project I told him you know be happy
to have the position like to do the
research there but I told I'm not going
to work on machine translation because
it's totally pointless uh if you the way
to do machine translation I said is just
by Brute Force
uh and talked about some ways to do it
by Brute Force there were still a belief
at the time that if enough was
understood about what a translator does
you could program it and that would get
you to do machine translation I felt
then as I feel now that that was Pie in
the Sky
just Illusions we didn't understand that
much and over the years that I think has
turned out to be true that Google has a
translator which is kind of useful if
you want to get the rough idea of what's
in say some scientific article it's in
you know some language you don't know
it's kind of helpful but it's done by
brute force it doesn't give any insight
into the nature of translation that's a
hard problem just as it's a hard problem
to figure out how a be can navigate
these are not trivial questions and for
humans the problems are much greater
than for insects for a lot of reasons
one reason is that we're just a lot more
complex you know B say has maybe 800,000
neurons we have 10 billion it's big
difference the other reason is that with
other
organisms we allow ourselves to do
invasive
experimentation with humans we don't Ian
it's not a sharp distinction but
significant distinction so there are
plenty of questions you can ask about
say the kind of problems I'm interested
in like say language acquisition nature
Lang sotic there are plenty of questions
you can think of asking but you can't
and you can even design an experiment to
pursue them and if you were say mangala
you could carry out the experiment but
fortunately we're not all Nazi doctors
so you can't carry out the experiment
which means you have to study human
intelligence human brain in much more
indirect ways and that is an added
difficulty over say studying B there you
can do any experiment you
life so what's your take generally
speaking about uh race uh technological
singularity it's science fiction I don't
see any particular reason to believe it
you want to play games with it okay
because there are whole Institutes
uh fearing for example the creation of
artificial intelligence like the machine
uh uh Mir machine intelligence Research
Institute previously The Singularity
Institute who are fearing that once
there is uh artificial general
intelligence smarter than humans that
would pretty much signal the end of our
species we shouldn't be concerned about
that possibility in your
view I think we should be concerned
about the end of our species but not for
that reason reason we should be
concerned about it because we are very
busy dedicating ourselves to destroying
the possibility for decent
survival uh we should worry about that
like the most recent ipcc report but the
singularity stories are science fiction
for one thing there's no remember when
people when you talk about machines it's
kind of misleading people have a feeling
well it's this cute little robot they
had in Star Wars you know art through D2
a machine the reference to machines is a
reference to
programs the program that you put into a
device that's sitting on your desk the
device itself is of no use for anything
other than maybe a holding down papers
it's a paper weight uh but it can
execute the program now what's a program
the program is a theory it's a the it's
a theory written in a in an Arcane
complex notation designed to be executed
by the machine but about the program you
ask the same questions you ask about any
other Theory does it give insight and
understanding well in fact these
theories don't they're not designed with
that in mind and not surprisingly they
don't not much maybe marginally so what
we're asking is can we design a theory
of being
and we're eons away from that MH uh no
we only have probably a couple minutes
at most so I just want to ask you do you
think you've mentioned the sort of
fundamental challenges that we are
facing as Humanity different in your
view uh than the technological
singularity do you think we've made any
progress as a
civilization well plenty of progress in
all sorts of ways I mean things that
were taken for granted as normal uh in
the 18th century would today be
considered as utter barbarism in fact we
don't have to go back that far it takes
a half the species women uh and when the
American Constitution was established
women were not people they were property
it took over British common law which
was the most advanced of the day in
which a woman was the property of her
father transmitted to her husband uh
that continued until pretty recently in
fact it was as recent as
1975 not that long ago that the US
Supreme Court granted women the right
the right to serve on juries meaning
their peers that's what a jury is
supposed to be jury of your peers people
like you that's a generation ago and
that's progress very slow progress
agonizing and in many ways there's
regression but over time the the
tendency is towards progress like I
mentioned animal experimentation before
until very
recently mammals cats primates monkeys
were subjected to just about any kind of
experimentation you wanted to do that's
no longer the case they're pretty Sharp
restrictions ethical restrictions on
animal
experimentation okay I think all of this
whether it's the
women
African-Americans immigrants whatever
there's a slow expansion of the moral
sphere slow but detectable so for
example just a couple of weeks ago the
state of
California uh agreed to allow
undocumented immigrants to serve on
juries that's a little bit like allowing
women to serve on juries it's beginning
to admit them barely into the category
of human beings well long way to go on
that but these are small steps as
progress there's also regression so take
say the climate destruction which we
talked about that not only are the are
we carrying out the process of
destroying the environment for decent
existence but we've become aware of it
so if you go back say 50 years it was
happening but there wasn't very little
awareness of it I remember myself very
well in the early
1970s two friends personal friends one
of whom happened to be the head of
meteorology at MIT the other the head of
Earth Sciences at Harvard both of them
that about the same time started warning
that there's a problem developing that
we hadn't recognized with regard to
what's now called global warming that
could be very serious in
future 20 years earlier that was not
known then it was beginning to be
understood now any rational person
recognizes to be extremely serious and
unfortunately any rational person
doesn't happen to include a large part
of the US
[Music]
Congress one leading commentator on
television
recently asked about this said well
we'll leave it in the hands of God okay
then we're tell we're saying let's
consign our grandchildren to a kind of
Oblivion that's uh
substantial but there's a long way to go
and not much time to do it that's a lot
more significant than idle speculations
about some potential singularity my
view you've said that there has been
some slow uh but still notable progress
does that make you cautiously optimistic
about our future despite all the
difficulties and challenges that we're
definitely going to face putting aside
The Singularity from environmental
degradation from nuclear proliferation
and things like
that I think an objective Observer from
Mars let's say looking at the human
species would conclude that uh they're
they're an evolutionary
error that that they're designed in such
a way that leads them to destroy
themselves and probably much else along
with them I that would be a rational
conclusion we can decide whether that
conclusion is right or wrong fate that
choices in our hands so I don't think
it's a question of optimism or pessimism
but do we make the choice the effort to
show that what looks like rational
conclusion is nevertheless mistaken
that's up to us last two questions uh do
you think that uh resource-based economy
and the Venus Project for example or the
Zeitgeist Movement provide an
alternative structure where as you say
perverse short short-term incentives for
maximizing profits will not end up
making otherwise good people being for
to make bad
choices it's Pleasant ideas when I read
it I think gee that would be nice uh but
there are many other suggestions about
what would be
nice spin them off very any of your
favorites yeah my favorite of the ones I
talk about
like Democratic control of every aspect
of social life production consumption
distribution
[Music]
represent political representation a
long way to go on that and simply
creating expanding the sphere of human
and in fact animal rights all of that's
important ending there are very specific
things that have to be dealt with which
is why not much interested in these kind
of Airy speculations one of them we've
talked about it's destruction of the
environment which is extremely serious
the other mentioned it's kind of a
miracle that we've escaped the nuclear
war literally a miracle and you can't
expect that Miracle continue so
something quickly and urgently has to be
done to eliminate this curse yeah Dr
chumsky my last question is what is your
most important message the the most
important thing that you would like our
viewers and listeners to take away from
this conversation with you
today I'd like to I think people ought
to take a cleare eyed look at the world
around us where it's going where it's
likely to go if we are remain passive
and obedient and conformist and that's a
grim future that's the conclusion of the
Observer from Mars and then to decide
what we can do to avert that
Tre thank you very much Dr chsky really
appreciate your time today thank
you
