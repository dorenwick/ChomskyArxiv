could you list some dangers that
humanity is facing or is going to face
in the 21st century and What mechanisms
are available to the public in order to
avoid this
catastrophes so what what dangers are we
going to face in the 21st century and
there there are two overwhelming dangers
huge Shadows looming over everything the
first of them is environmental
catastrophe which is coming we can
debate how long it'll be but it's coming
and it could be very severe now there
are things that can be done about it but
in some places some things are being
done like say Denmark is moving towards
some kind of sustainable energy Germany
has plans to move towards a larger
degree of sustainable energy but for the
most part we're just racing towards the
uh Cliff that we're going to fall over
it's almost certain that most of the
fossil fuels must be left in the ground
uh if we hope to have a decent
Survival on the contrary the energy
corporation are trying to exploit every
last opportunity to get a drop of oil
out of the ground or guess uh and U
they're not they're not being stopped
that's uh part of the logic of uh a
capitalist Market is that you maximize
short-term profit and you don't pay
attention to what the consequences are
for others for the future so that's a
huge problem and things can be done
about it but they're not being done
except in limited ways and uh that will
be real catastrophe for our not very far
off for future Generations the other
major major Shadow is nuclear war that
should not be underestimated we've come
very close to nuclear war repeatedly the
nuclear war is essentially a terminal
disaster it's a something survive but
not much and we've come close there are
serious dangers right now we know how to
in theory we know how to eliminate them
but we're not doing it uh in fact the
nuclear programs are being
expanded us program is being expanded by
about a trillion dollars over the coming
decades uh but there's serious crisis in
Ukraine and the Middle East elsewhere
that could break into nuclear war these
are major problems in the background is
another problem it's not not a problem
of survival but it's a problem of
minimal decency and that is the
neoliberal assault against the global
population that's been going on now for
a generation it's having different
effects in different places almost
always delerious now a few places have
been been able to begin to extricate
themselves from it one of the most
important is South America for the first
time in 500 years
South America has become has begun to
extricate itself from Western Imperial
control last century that means Us
control to unify to uh to develop
internal organizations that exclude
Western domination to face some of its
tremendous internal problems the US has
been almost driven out of most of the
hemisphere which is a remarkable change
world affairs and they partly they're
reacting to the neoliberal assault which
was quite devastating in South America
they actually followed the rules and
suffered uh other in Europe uh the
austerity programs are extremely
destructive destructive of Life of
survival of democracy and there are some
attempts in the peripheral countries
mainly to try to respond to them uh in
the United States uh the neoliberal
assault has had the effect of virtually
undermining democracy it barely
functions take a look at the last
election 24 November
2014 the statistics have just come out
on actual voting they've been studied by
some leading political scientists for
Dean burnner Thomas Ferguson what they
point out is that voting participation
in the last election was actually for
the most part back to the level of the
early 19th century that's a time when
voting was restricted to property white
males voting participation is back to
that level in much of the country that's
a sign that people have simply abandoned
any hope in the democratic system with
some reason because St careful studies
show what we basically all know that the
opinions and attitudes of the large
majority of the population have no
effect whatsoever un policy and policy
is determined by a extremely narrow
sector of concentrated wealth that's
plutocracy it's not democracy take a
look at the economic situation since the
neoliberal assult began mainly under ra
little before but escalating under
Reagan uh for most of the population
it's been a period of stagnation or
decline the real wages for male workers
are back to the level of the 1960s but
there's been productivity growth and
wealth increase but it's going to a tiny
percentage of the population actually a
fraction of 1% Dominate and for most of
the population it's station sometimes
decline those are serious problems they
can be dealt with those are not at the
level of the first two I mentioned but
they're serious and they're affecting
people's lives seriously and there are
plenty of other problems to deal with it
takes a uh a terrorism serious problem
the most there is a global terrorism
campaign far beyond any other it's
Obama's drown campaign that's a
terrorist campaign of a scale has never
existed in the past this campaign is
formally officially explicitly aimed at
people who the government suspects might
someday want to harm us might someday
want to harm us they have to be killed
along with anybody else standing around
I mean if uh you know Al-Qaeda or anyone
came out with a campaign like that we
would be Beyond scandalized we probably
nuke them but that's official policy
supported by the Western countries now
that's a serious problem Global
terrorism is a serious problem and this
is right at the top
