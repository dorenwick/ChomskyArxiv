all right everybody I guess we're uh all
ready to get started um I'm going to
make this quick because I hear some
people started staking out seats at 2
o'clock it's a little crazy um so uh
first I'd like to thank the uh political
Theory project her sponsoring
organization uh professor John tamasi
Dina egy Mary mid uh without them this
event would not have been possible uh
I'd also like to thank Zack inber from H
and felis fight from uh students for
justice in Palestine they helped us a
lot with planning the event uh we got uh
names of possible speakers event topics
from them they were a huge help um I'd
also like to thank all of you for
showing up this is really fantastic a
great turnout and I'd like to thank our
speakers um who need no introduction if
you really want a full bio you can just
uh look in your program it's in there um
so the format today we're going to do uh
25 minute opening statements uh followed
by uh about a five minute rebuttal by
each speaker and then we're going to
move straight to Q&A and we uh we're
looking to finish up around 6 o'clock so
um just a word about uh this discussion
it's obviously a divisive topic um a lot
of emotions for a good reason um and the
Israeli Palestinian conflict is not from
either side a civil conflict but we're
looking here to have a civil
conversation um and so I would just ask
that you remain respectful um this is a
conversation and I know it's sort of
framed as a debate um but it's not an
opportunity to to yell it's not an
opportunity to samp your feet there are
other forms for that this is this is
meant to be discussion um I I don't want
to drive that point home too much but um
should be great without further Ado I'm
going to turn it over to Professor chsky
give him a round of applause
uh the question we've been asked to
address is whether America's support for
Israel prevents peace and the
straightforward way to address the
question is simply to run through the
record so I'll keep to the parts that
are well documented and you can easily
check uh we'll begin in 1967 when the
current
period begins to develop that's when
Israel conquered the currently occupied
territories uh immediately afterwards
there was a United Nations resolution un
242 taken since to be the sort of gold
standard on the issue it called for
Israeli withdrawal in return for uh Arab
acceptance of
Peace um notice crucially that un 242
was uh
rejectionist it uh offered nothing to
the
Palestinians they were mentioned only
rather vaguely in uh terms of
unspecified Refugee Rights but nothing
about Palestinian national rights that's
important uh there was an impass either
side accepted it the impass was broken
in 1971 February 197 71 there was a un
negotiator gunar yaring and through his
mediation that President Sadat of Egypt
offered Israel a full peace treaty full
peace treaty in return for withdrawal
from the Egyptian sin he mentioned other
territories but he only cared about the
Sinai actually Jordan followed it with a
similar offer in
1972 uh at that point Israel had a
choice crucial choice they had to choose
between expansion and
security a peace treaty with Egypt would
have meant security it's the only
significant Arab military force but
Israel Israel rejected it uh they were
at the time U planning extensive
development projects in the Egyptian sin
major port city yamit on the
Mediterranean lots of
settlements they were driving bin in out
of their homes destroying their Villages
driving them into the desert thousands
of them and they decided to pursue that
policy of expansion rather than to
accept what would have been peace and
security The crucial question as always
is how the US would react and there was
a split in the US government the state
department pretty much supported Sadat's
proposal uh Henry Kissinger the National
Security advisor was opposed to it and
in the bureau atic battle he won out uh
his policy as he explained was what he
called stalemate no negotiations just
force and at that time it was assumed
pretty widely that the Arabs had no
Force well sadad kept warning that if
Israel refused negotiations he would
have to go to war uh yamit Means War as
he put it he expelled the Russians tried
to make uh good relations with the
United States but kinger basically
disregarded it it wasn't taken seriously
to everyone's surprised he did launch a
war in
1973 and it was a pretty close call for
Israel actually for the world uh ker
called a nuclear alert at one point we
now know from Recently Declassified
documents what was happening uh the
United States in Russia had imposed a
ceasefire but
Kissinger privately informed Israel that
they could violate it with impunity
which they did the Russians then
threatened to intervene if Israel
continued to violate the ceasefire
Kissinger called the nuclear alert to
warn them not to
intervene they backed off so it wasn't
an international crisis but it was a
close call Kissinger then understood
that the Arab states could not simply be
dismissed as basket cases he began his
famous shuttle diplomacy that led
finally to the camp David agreements
1978-79 in which the United States in
Israel pretty much accepted Sadat's 1971
proposal but by then in a form that was
much uh harsher from the US Israeli
point of view because by then it
included recognition of Palestinian
rights uh that's described here often as
a diplomatic Triumph in fact it was a
diplomatic
catastrophe uh if the proposal had been
accepted in 1971 when it was offered it
would have spared the region uh
Devastation War near
disaster and the world a threat well
that's Camp DAV first Camp David I think
myself that that 1971 decision in Israel
that was the labor party that was the
most fateful decision in their history
they chose
expansion instead of security and that's
been pretty much the story since well
meanwhile in the
1970s the issue of Palestinian
nationalism did reach the N the
international agenda and in January 1976
there was a security Council resolution
put forth by the leading Arab states
Egypt Jordan and Syria calling for what
has become an overwhelming International
consent enses they called for a
two-state settlement on the
internationally recognized border with
guarantees for the rights of each state
to exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized borders it's the
wording of un
242 uh the US vetoed it uh there was a
similar resolution in
1980 United States
vetoed
uh diplomatic action then shifted to the
general assembly where there's no veto I
won't run through the record but uh if
you look year after year there's a
similar resolution at the general
assembly the votes are 151 to3 us Israel
martial Islands or something like that
that goes on right through the period uh
meanwhile the uh the most recent us veto
in the security Council did get some
attention because most of the time it's
a ignored was a little surprising that
was Obama February 19
2011 this was a resolution calling for
implementation of official US
policy official US policy is opposition
to expansion of the settlements and
that's what the resolution called for
but the US vetoed it which did raise a
few
eyebrows uh it's worth bearing in mind
that settlement expansion though that's
what's disc
is a kind of a secondary issue it's the
settlements that are illegal the
settlements in the massive
infrastructure programs in which they're
embedded which are expanding rapidly uh
that they're illegal is not seriously in
question that's been determined by the
highest authorities the security Council
the international court of justice so
for example the security Council in
1979 resolution
452 declared all the settlement and
development programs illegal void it was
passed 14 to zero one exstension the
United States uh the international court
of justice reached a similar conclusion
in an advisory opinion actually the US
Justice agreed with it in a separate
opinion so the illegality of the
settlement programs and development
programs is not seriously in question uh
well meanwhile more and and this has
become an overwhelming International
consensus includes the Arab League the
organization of Islamic states which
includes
Iran essentially the whole world outside
the United States and Israel uh in
1988 the Palestinian National Congress
formally accepted the international
consensus in those
terms uh Israel reacted of course in May
1989 Israel gave its response this is a
coalition government two major political
blocks labor and
leud Yak Shamir shiman peris Israel uh
responded by saying that there can be no
additional Palestinian State between
Jordan and Israel the phrase additional
Palestinian state reflects the Israeli
insistence that Jordan is a Palestinian
State the jordanians don't think so the
Palestinians don't think so but know
what do they know uh Israel that claims
it's a Palestinian State and there can
be no additional one uh question as
always and then it continued that U the
fate of the occupied territories would
have to be esta uh settled in accord
with the guidelines of the government of
Israel I'm quoting from it again
question is how will the US react uh it
reacted a couple of months later
December 1989 the baker plan James Baker
Secretary of State which fully endorsed
the Israeli position fully endorsed it
just repeated it as I said it's
1989 uh shortly after that comes the
Gulf War the first Gulf War after the
Gulf War President Bush number one uh
initiated
negotiations called the Madrid
negotiations there was a
Palestinian Palestinians were involved
the internal Palestinians not the
external ones who were in Tunis uh the
internal Palestinians were involved they
were led by um probably the most
respected person in the occupied
territories hayra Abdul Shafi dedicated
nationalist uh but they didn't get
anywhere because alafi refused to accept
the principle of settlement expansion
that was what was an issue he rejected
that and those negotiations were at a
dead end at about that time yaser Arafat
who was in
Tunis that's the external Palestinians
it made it kind of an end run around the
internal Palestinians there's
interesting issues here about internal
Palestinian politics I don't have time
to go into it but he made an agreement
through nor Norway which led to what we
called the Oslo
Accords uh which pretty much excluded
the domestic
Palestinians uh hayra Abdu Shafi totally
rejected it um that led to the famous
U meeting on the White House lawn
shaking hands Bill Clinton you know with
his arms around Arafat and Rabin and so
on uh a lot of euphoria about it in the
United States the Press called at the
day of awe uh as I said ABD Shafi
refused even to come there's plenty of
protest among Palestinians and if you
look at the agreement you can see why
there was one document a declaration of
principles that's a couple of pages you
can look it up in the internet uh the
document stated that the end result of
negotiations laid out a period of
negotiations the end result would be the
implementation of un
242 but remember un 242 offered nothing
to the Palestinians and that was to be
the end result of the
negotiations well I won't go through the
further record but uh it developed as
you'd expected uh the Israel under prime
minister Robin and prime minister per
Paris a rapidly accelerated development
and settlement prog programs in the
occupied territories they were flatly
opposed to any kind of n of Palestinian
State said so
explicitly uh the uh schma benami who
was
the head of the foreign office and U one
of the chief negotiators wrote a book
about it in Hebrew unfortunately in
which he described the goal of Israel
during this period the 19 90s as
establishing what he called a permanent
neocolonial dependency for the
Palestinians in the occupied
territories uh that continued until the
year 2000 which in fact was the peak
year of settlement expansion of
settlements then came the Camp David
agreements of negot not agreements
negotiations of
2000 uh they uh didn't get they didn't
get anywhere the Palestinians with not
it was recognized that no Palestinians
could accept what was offered I actually
have a map of it here but essentially
The Proposal was for u a canonization of
the West Bank uh Israel would take
what's called Jerusalem it's actually a
huge area much larger than historic
Jerusalem greater Jerusalem extends well
into the West Bank and bear in mind that
whatever Israel does in Jerusalem is
doubly illegal not only is it illegal
because everything going on in the West
Bank is but it violates specific uh
repeated Security Council resolutions
demanding that Israel terminate any
change in the status of Jerusalem so it
includes this greatly expanded area also
a carridor to the east I'm actually
looking at the map carrier to the east
which goes virtually to the border of uh
of Jordan Big Town Mal alumim is in the
middle of it was built mostly in the
Clinton years primarily to kind of
bisect the West Bank that does virtually
bisect the West Bank there's another
Corridor to the north it goes to the
town of Ariel and Beyond it to Shilo
another town that pretty much bisects
what's left other settlements uh uh
that's those are the programs of the
1990s of course Palestinians didn't
accept it Clinton himself recognized
that this was unacceptable in December
2000 he issued what he called his
parameters which were somewhat vague but
more
forthcoming uh couple of days later
January 7th at the Israel policy Forum
he gave an important speech in which he
said that both sides had accepted his
parameters both sides had reservations
that they met then in January 2001 in
tabba Egypt to try to iron out their
reservations and they were making
progress apparently in their final
meeting they issued a press conference I
can quote it for you here if you like
but essentially they said that there was
a lot of progress and if they could go
on a little bit longer they might
resolve everything well Israel called
off the negotiations that was the end of
that uh and uh they haven't resumed
formally speaking there's a the Israeli
the top Israeli scholar
who Scholars have written about this Ron
pundu and sha areli pundu was the
director of the Paris Peace Center he's
died recently Ariel is one of the top
negotiators uh here's their assessment
uh prior I'll quote it prior to Camp
David both sides failed to live up to
their commitments but the Israeli
breaches were much more numerous more
substantive in
nature Netanyahu after sh Paris and
Shamir and Rabin sabotaged the peace
process
relentlessly uh barack's election labor
party in
1999 raised expectations but they were
dashed by his refusal to transfer to the
Palestinians Villages around greater
Jerusalem and and by actions on the
ground the increase in harassment
Collective punishment creation of
poverty water shortages expanded
settlement while Palestinians were
confined to Bantan like enclaves and
support there was plenty of support by
uh really ugly actions by the settlers
by the Army and Civil Authorities uh at
Camp David 2000 the Palestinian
leadership and the majority of the
public were ready to make necessary
concessions but needed some indication
that the relation of occupier occupied
would change and Barack prime minister
of Israel did not provide these uh I can
go on if you like but that's the basic
tone and that's pretty accurate by other
presentations well it goes on to the
present uh constant Israeli expansion in
the West Bank C canonization increases
the Israel's mean while quietly
developing the Jordan Valley big area
Palestinians are being expelled Villages
are being Israeli settlements are being
built well sunk and so on uh uh all of
this
continues with full uh us support maybe
a clicking of the tongue clucking of the
tongues but basically full support uh
meanwhile the Golan Heights Syrian Golan
Heights Israel
annexed uh the security Council
instantly declared that null and void
without any legal effect unanimous
decision no effect uh Gaza and the West
Bank have been separated the Oslo
agreements determined explicitly that
Gaza and the West Bank are a single
territorial Unity territorial integrity
at once in 199 93 the US and Israel
began to separate Gaza from the West
Bank in violation of their commitments
at
Oslo best study of this if you want to
look at it is by Sarah Roy a scholar at
Harvard specialist in this uh the uh uh
in U this is quite crucial incidentally
because if you look at the geography
you'll see that any kind of autonomy
that might be achieved in the West Bank
would mean very little because it would
be imprisoned the only Outlet to the
outside world is Gaza and if Gaza and
the West Bank are separated then
essentially there's nothing uh 19 Gaza
has been under severe Israeli attack
ever since 1993 it's escalated in recent
years uh in there was settlement Israeli
settlement there illegal of course in
1995 Ariel Shaun
uh determined that it would make more
sense to take the few thousand settlers
in Gaza who were occupying more than a
third of the territory to take them from
their illegal settlements in Gaza and
move them to their to other illegal
settlements in the West Bank that's what
was called the withdrawal uh relieved
huge part of the Israeli Army from
protecting a few thousand settlers in
Gaza uh the uh the Israeli Army actually
left Gaza in October
1995 uh The Siege remained and in
January 2006 there was a free election
in Palestine carefully monitored
recognized to be free uh the United
States and Israel didn't like the
outcome the outcome was that
Hamas essentially won the plurality they
took control us and Israel didn't like
that both instantly imposed harsh
sanctions very harsh sanctions the
Israeli attacks continued that's the
only free election in the Arab world
gives you a good indication of what
democracy promotion means uh the United
States and Israel immediately began
preparations for a military coup that
was to take place a year later it was
preempted by Hamas two sides separated
just just yesterday they reached an
agreement finally uh that's what was
going on in Gaza that the it's been
under severe sanctions Siege constant
attack uh it's uh in 19 uh in in
[Music]
2008 there
was a ceasefire established between
Hamas and Israel it last Hamas lived up
to it completely you can read the
official Israeli record there wasn't a
single Hamas rocket until Israel broke
the
ceasefire November 2008 by invading Gaza
killing Hamas militants then there was
an exchange of rockets of course
everyone who's killed this Palestinian
the imbalance is extraordinary uh Hamas
offered to renew the ceasefire Israel
refused they decided instead to launch a
major attack on Gaza that's Operation
castled uh it was uh a really vicious
brutal attack there's plenty of
documentation on this it was studied by
Amnesty International Human Rights Watch
The Goldstone commission and it it was
um if you really want to know the
details what I'd urge is reading a
important book by two Norwegian
Physicians matz Gilbert and Eric FAA who
worked at the the main Gaza Hospital
right through it and give a kind of
minute by- minute description of what
was going on but the international human
rights uh U reports are very revealing
the UN did try to impose a ceas fire uh
the vote was 14 to zero one exstension
US refused to vote for meanwhile the US
was providing weapons well uh the G has
kind of it's been described as an open
air prison which is pretty accurate
anyone who's been there I have can see
it right away a be survival well that's
pretty much the story all won't go into
further details uh The crucial thing is
that the United States continues to
provide
crucial uh economic military diplomatic
and ideological support to Israel the
IDE logical support is the way the
issues are framed uh the for example
most of what I've described though it's
all fully documented that you don't read
about you don't see you have to do
research to find it out uh that's uh
cons the records well documented it's
consistent the United States is
essentially alone in the world on this
us and Israel are virtually alone the
Diplomatic record reveals it and you can
see it in policy and I think that uh
provides a pretty clear answer to the
question that was raised here does the
US support for Israel prevent peace
[Music]
thanks and now Ambassador Dennis Ross
[Applause]
well thank you I can see that there's
actually no interest in this topic
so I guess I'll talk about it
anyway you know it's um I have to say
that you know Professor Chomsky is a is
a very wellknown
uh very
respected uh linguist as a professor of
linguistics it's very clear that he has
a world reputation and I wouldn't dream
to challenge him on anything related to
Linguistics but we're not talking about
Linguistics today we are going to talk
about and we've heard about the question
of Arab Israeli peace or efforts at
peace and why it hasn't happened uh and
there I feel very comfortable
challenging him uh partly because he is
not an acknowledged expert on that
partly because I've studied the history
but more importantly than that uh I was
a practitioner I have been for the last
30 years someone who was involved in
every effort at trying to promote peace
in the area so I know it not from
secondary sources I know it not from
certain documents I know it from
firsthand experience and I want to talk
about that and I want to take on the
question that he addressed he did
address that the question that the two
of us were asked to come and talk about
and that specifically was as as
Professor Chomsky put it does United
States support for Israel prevent peace
I want to address it because the essence
of the question presumes that the reason
there's no peace is because of Israel
now he laid out uh a historical
record uh and um I have to say that it
obviously represents his point of view
as Andel Patrick Mahan used to say
everyone is entitled to their own
opinion they're just not entitled to
their own facts uh and what I want to do
is I want to lay out a a view of history
that obviously differs from him and in
some cases I I will specifically
challenge some of the points he's made
in other cases I'll talk about other
points that I think are relevant but let
me start I'll go earlier than he did he
started after
67 uh I want to start again because the
question the the premise of this
question is that the reason there's no
pieces because of
Israel if we go back to the period
before the time that Israel existed
before the state during the British
mandate period there were proposals to
try to settle the conflict between the
Palestinian the Arabs of Palestine and
the Jews of
Palestine uh the British were the
mandatory power in 1936 there was that
began what would became known as the
Arab Revolt it was a revolt against the
mandatory Authority it was also revolt
against the Jewish presence that was
increasing in Palestine the Royal
commission that was established to
investigate the causes of the conflict
there and to make recommendations for
how to resolve it was called appeal
commission and it proposed that
Palestine should be partitioned into two
states a Jewish State and an Arab State
the Arabs of Palestine rejected it the
Jewish leaders of Palestine accepted it
a decade later the British after having
failed with a with a plan called the
moris and Grady plan which by the way
both the the Jews and the Arabs of
Palestine rejected the British then came
to the UN and said we went out we're
done they turned the problem over to the
UN the un uh special Commission on
Palestine then investigated went in
assessed made a judgment there was a
majority report and a minor Minority
Report the majority report basically
came to the conclusion that the only way
to to resolve the conflict was to
partition Palestine into a Jewish State
and an Arab state so on November 29th
1947 that partition plan was voted by
the
un uh once again the Jews of Palestine
accepted it the Arabs of Palestine
rejected it and the Arabs in the region
rejected it now let's fast forward to
Camp David which takes place September
78 it is the result of what was a Sadat
initiative Sadat goes to Jerusalem he
goes to Jerusalem after there are secret
meetings between toam and Dian meaning a
minister close to him and mosha
Dian uh and in fact the Camp David
Accords which emerg from uh the Camp
David discussions in September of 78
have two parts of them one part
represents an Egyptian Israeli peace
treaty and the other part represented an
approach a framework for how to resolve
the Palestinian conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians and that would
have created interim self-government
Authority for the Palestinians that
would govern over a period of a 5-year
uh transition period at the end of that
they were supposed to resolve the
permanent status issues now after the
the Egyptian Israeli peace treaty of
79 there were were in fact negotiations
between the Egyptians uh and the
Israelis and the Israelis at that time
accepted did something that the
Egyptians proposed which was that the
interim self-government Authority should
have in fact a say in what happened to
the use of land meaning that if in fact
this agreement had come into being and
if Palestinians had been part of it and
if the PLO had not rejected it as every
other all the Arabs except for the
country of Oman rejected what Sadat was
doing if this had been accepted
Palestinians would have had a veto over
Israeli settlement activity at that time
at a time when you had roughly 5,000
settlers outside of Jerusalem not the
over 300,000 outside of Jerusalem that
you have today now in the summer of 2000
when we were at Camp David I was
President Clinton's negotiator in the
Middle East when we were at Camp David
in the summer of 2000 yasar arfad said
to me that saddat had invited him to
come to Camp David back in 78 and he
wanted to go and he said the Soviets and
the syrians prevented him from
going and I said to him you have a
chance every Palestinian you know today
laments that the partition plan wasn't
accepted maybe in 1947 it was too
difficult maybe overcoming the
opposition of all the Arabs was too hard
you yourself are lamenting to me now
that you wish you had gone in
1978 okay you were block blocked at that
time nothing blocks you today you're the
one here who can make a decision don't
let the next generation of Palestinians
look back and lament that there was a
possibility of saying yes and you said
no and here I have to here there's a
specific point of fact that I have to
correct there was not a plan at Camp
David that was a canonization plan there
are maps that were produced that are
completely
inauthentic on this one I was there
we presented parameters at Camp David we
presented no Maps the only maps that
existed that show what was really
offered at Camp David are in my book The
Missing Piece those are authentic
because the maps didn't exist except for
the fact that I then had them drawn they
do not show a
canonization uh but that was rejected we
didn't quit as professor champy said
it's true we didn't quit after Camp
David we did not quit after Camp David
is that from the missing piece where it
comes from the missing
piece was he at Camp
David was he was at Camp David no he was
not he was not there I know what was
presented we're the ones who presented
it to our fat the Israelis didn't we did
all right we presented it and the
Clinton parameters you know who the
author the main author of the Clinton
parameters was you're looking at it I
was the main author of the Clinton
parameters now now we did that uh at the
end of December the Israeli government
accepted voted for accepting the Clinton
parameters uh and I want to note by the
way the inata had erupted and the
aararat was behind the inata we went
ahead anyway and we did the Clinton
parameters which you are quite right
they went well beyond what was offered
at Camp
David they offered basically a
Palestinian state with a capital in
Jerusalem where all the Arab neighbors
what was Arab would be
Palestinian including in the old city
and what was Jewish would be
Israeli 100% of Gaza would be given up
most of the West Bank would be given
up now here again rfat said no you
quoted what President Clinton said in
his ipf speech January 2nd we had a
meeting in the White House in the Oval
Office with the president me and
arat and there arfat rejected the
Clinton parameters there is a reason
that the president said that both sides
offered reservations the reason was that
Barack basically didn't want us to say
that the arfat had rejected it because
he was an election campaign against
chirome but the fact is that rfat
rejected every single thing that he was
asked to to compromise on his side he
rejected every single point so he said
No at Camp David when there wasn't
canonization he said no to a better deal
with the Clinton parameters and he
promoted an
intifa by saying no to the Clinton
parameters the message to the Israeli
public was that basically nothing will
satisfy
them and the inata wasn't just a
rejection of the most forthcoming
government in Israel's history it was
also then violence and the violence
which
began after Chiron went to the Temple
Mount was completely orchestrated by the
Palestinians
at that time rfat did nothing to stop
that violence the violence then in 2001
became characterized by Suicide bombings
suicide bombings of buses of cafes of
hotels of
nightclubs and that killed the peace
camp in
Israel and one of the reasons that we're
in a in a sense things have evolved the
way they have is because those who were
the strongest constituency for peace
within Israel were the ones became
discredited because of what
happened now I should add just on the
point on
taba the fact of what happened at taba
taba was held the first week of the Bush
Administration what happened at taba
it's true what you said about what they
said at the end what isn't the case
however is that this was before the
Israeli election the Israeli negotiators
who were there wanted the Palestinians
to agree to what was on the table so
they could hold that up they didn't
think that IR was going to win at that
point they thought Chiron was going to
win at that point and they wanted an
agreement that could then be used to try
to hold Chiron to something and arfat
refused not the Palestinian negotiators
there but arfat
refused right that's not the end of the
story here you not only have the intifa
that goes on but you then have in 2005
chiron's decision to withdraw from Gaza
now he withdraws from Gaza and he pulls
out all the settlers and and all the
soldiers I went into Gaza and gave a
speech a Palestinian friend of mine zad
Abu Amar asked me to to come and speak
uh in uh in Gaza a couple months before
the Israelis pulled
out and I said and I didn't what I
didn't know he didn't tell
me that the whole opposition the whole
leadership of Hamas was going to be
there as well uh as the uh as the
members of
fata uh and I said to this audience of
several hundred I said you have a unique
opportunity now you can show the world
and you can show the Israelis you can
show the Israeli public that you can
turn Gaza into something you can turn it
into a going concern and you can prove
to the Israeli public that if it can
work in Gaza then you can do the same
thing in the West Bank as well but if
you turn Gaza into a platform for
attacks against Israel after you pull
out who in Israel is going to say oh we
can also do this in the West Bank in the
West Bank that sits as stride every
Israeli Central population area the
answer is going to be nobody so here's
your opportunity take advantage of it
and what happened the first week after
the Israelis withdrew from Gaza you
talked about a Siege of Gaza the ga the
siege of Gaza didn't exist when the
Israelis withdrew the first week after
the Israelis withdrew there were attacks
so you withdraw from Terror Rory and you
get attacks the principle of 242 was
supposed to be land for peace it wasn't
supposed to be land for nothing it
wasn't supposed to be land for violence
it was supposed to be land for peace
land for security the Israelis withdrew
from Gaza and what they got was not
anything but Violence by the way Barack
had withdrawn from Lebanon in May of
2000 uh same thing happened
there hisbah looked at the withdrawal as
a sign of victory for resistance not an
indication that if the Israelis withdraw
from territory you should take advantage
of it right the last effort less serious
effort apart from what's been going on
recently we can talk about that in our
discussion later
on mer offers a
proposal to Abu Mazin in 2008 he and Abu
masin had been meeting privately and
finally he he came and he said look
let's cut through it
all and he presented a proposal The
Proposal was something that actually
went beyond the Clinton parameters on
Jerusalem it was very similar to Clinton
but on the territory it was actually
better from palestin standpoint because
in the West Bank he was going to
preserve blocks of about 6.3% of the
territory and he was going to swap 5.8%
from territory within Israel for that
and then you were talking about the gap
between Gaza and West Bank he was going
to create safe Passage through Israel
because Israel separates Gaza in the
West Bank he was going to create safe
passage to make up for the 0.5% that he
wasn't compensating with the 5.8 to
6.3 AB masin didn't give an answer he
didn't say yes he didn't say no he
didn't give a
response now I recite the history for a
reason if you say that Israel is the
reason there's no peace history belies
that that's just not the
reality now when I say this does this
mean that I think that everything the
Israelis have done has contributed to
peace no do I think that this is a
morality play where one side is all
right and the other is all wrong no I
don't I've spent too much time as a
mediator between the two
sides but the the fact is you can't say
that Israel is the only reason there's
no peace and when I say that the the
settlements obviously don't contribute
to peace that's a fact they don't
contribute to peace they make the
Palestinians feel powerless and they
raised the political cost within Israel
of doing a deal but do the settlements
actually prevent an agreement will let
see the Israelis had settlements in the
Sinai and they withdrew from Sinai
including the settlements the Israelis
had settlements in Gaza and they
withdrew from Gaza including the
settlements when we have been talking
going back to what was being proposed
first in Camp David then in the Clinton
parameters we talked about settlement
blocks and swap
s to understand the nature of when you
hear the term settlement blocks to
understand there's five settlements out
of 120 represent 45% of the settler
population what we were suggesting in
the Clinton parameters was settlement
blocks of 5% which would accommodate 80%
of the settlers there is a way to deal
with the settlement issue as part of a
negotiation where you define the borders
and where you produce blocks then you
compensate the Palestinians for the
blocks that's what 67 in mutually agreed
swaps means all right how much more time
do I
have uh in between five and 10 minutes
okay I don't want to exceed my time
limits right I want to make a couple
other comments I want to say something
about the nature of us support for
Israel it is true that the US support
for Israel is profound there's no doubt
about it from 48 to 67 we provided the
Israelis essentially very little support
the French provided their arms and the
German reparations provided the key to
their Economic Development the US
doesn't provide doesn't begin to provide
serious Military Support uh to the
Israelis really until the 73 War the
first arms we sell first significant
arms we sell are in the Kennedy
administration and it's Hawk
anti-aircraft uh missiles the first
aircraft are sold by are sold by Lyon
Johnson
in the 73 War for the first week of the
war when you talk about professor and
Professor chsky talks about Henry
Kissinger and stalemate he viewed when
the war broke out he felt the war if the
war ended in a stalemate it would create
the potential for diplomacy and because
he assumed at the beginning of the war
that Israel had all the advantages and
would win the war decisively we don't
provide resupply to the Israelis for the
first week of the war
the Egyptians and the and the syrians
launched the war on yum kipur and the
Soviets are providing massive resupply
we don't provide resupply until one week
into the war kisser thought that Sadat
was going to accept a ceasefire
resolution that would have been a
ceasefire in place that would have
created a sense that Egypt had gained
something would have produced the need
for diplomacy then to come in and try to
begin to resolve the issues uh when
Sadat turned it down it was only at that
point in the the face of massive Soviet
resupply that we did then begin to
resupply the Israelis and this is a
turning point in the US relationship
with Israel the larger turning point in
terms of institutionalizing the
provision of arms and money comes first
with the Sinai 2 agreement in
1975 in 1975 Israel pulls back there
were two disengagements in the in the
Sinai the first one was away from the
sus Canal the second one took the
Israelis east of the of the pth within
the Sinai at the time the United States
provided very significant assurances as
well as
assistance that was much larger than
with the Camp David Accords and the
Egyptian Israeli peace treaty and that
institutionalize the kind of assistance
that we then provided to the Israelis
from then on the formula the Camp David
formula was $3 billion a year for the
Israelis $2 billion a year for
Egypt and so that was military support
and economic support was critical to
Israel through the 1980s actually George
Schulz provided a massive supplemental
to the Israelis at a time when they're
suffering from
hyperinflation you see a change from all
economic assistance all military
assistance during the George W Bush
Administration now the question might be
does Israel need this kind of support
well look at the
region right take
Iran you know the supreme leader of Iran
says that Israel is a cancerous tumor
they say Israel should is should be
wiped off the map they provided hisb
100,000 rockets in 2006 when hisb came
across the border after Israel had
withdrawn from Lebanon to kidnap Israeli
soldiers uh you know they fired lots of
rockets into Israel yes Israel hit
Lebanon very hard just as later on they
would hit Gaza very
hard uh that ceasefire by the way it's
true there was a ceasefire uh and in
November there was a shell left over a a
Hamas shell that exploded they claimed
it killed Palestines they then sent
Rockets into Israel Israel then
retaliated you know there are these
cycles that take off you know there is a
reality in this region look at the war
in Syria the wars here are Wars that
tend to be total what's happening in
Syria is a stain on the International
Conference a conscience where you can
actually have Barrel bombs artillery
aircraft used uh on civilian populations
and it's just taken as a given
somehow the reality is Israel lives in a
tough neighborhood we have given
assistance military assistance to Israel
for two sets of reasons one has been to
make it easier for them to take risk for
peace and two has been for deterrence
now saddat when he made peace with
Israel said you know I could fight
Israel but I couldn't fight the United
States so the US Israeli connection has
been part of the
deterrence uh the the value of doing
that I think is you look again look at
this region region look at the nature of
upheaval in the region
today and I want to close with one one
point the conflicts you see in this
region today are largely over
identity you see it in Iraq you see it
in
Syria uh and this is going to go on this
is upheaval that is going to go on for
the next 10 to 20
years now when you look at a region that
is characterized by this kind of
instability there is actually one state
in the
region that is governed by a rule of
law that
has an independent
Judiciary that has a separation of
powers that has regular
elections and those who run the
elections when they lose they accept the
outcomes
it has freedom of speech it has a free
press journalists don't get put in
jail it respects women's rights it
respects gay rights it has artistic
Freedom you look at movies like The
Gatekeepers that
documents the last the living heads of
shinb uh who talk about the impact of
occupation not just on the Palestinians
but on Israelis who make movies like
Bethlehem which does the same thing the
one state that is like that in this
region is
Israel and for that reason alone even
though it is not a perfect
State and one has to try to deal with
this conflict and end it but given the
fact that it is that kind of a state it
is deserving of American Support
[Applause]
well I agree with Ambassador Ross on one
statement that uh Everyone's entitled to
their own opinion but they're not
entitled to their own facts so what I
would suggest to you I won't review it
is that you look at the documentary
facts from 67 to the present I'm not
talking about people's Impressions I'm
not talking about the feelings of the
negotiators on either side you can they
are what they are uh but there's also a
documentary record I'll just talk about
a couple of the points that were raised
let's begin with the map at uh the Camp
David map Ambassador Ross is correct to
say that there's no official map the
United States and Israel never presented
an official map there was however a map
constructed by the leading uh Israeli
Specialists and participants sheli as
you know was the head of the Israeli
delegation his associate Ron kundak has
been involved in negotiations for years
and is the leading Israeli scholar on
this this is the map that they
constructed you can look at it if you
like I sort of described it but there
really isn't any point debating it
because this map is uh
is a subset of what now exists if you
take a look at what's going on since
Oslo since Camp David up to the present
with full us support you will see that
it's simply you can't see it but if you
want to look at you can it simply fills
out and expands the map that pundu and
arieli constructed from the Camp David
Accords so there's really nothing to
debate about that that's what's
happening in the West Bank canonized
broken up illegal Israeli settlements
half a million illegal Israeli settlers
no doubt about the legality the us as I
mentioned is alone in the world outside
of Israel in questioning this actually
the US accepted it as well until
1979 the US also call the settlements
illegal under Reagan that was downgraded
to an obstacle to peace uh under Obama
it's been downgraded still more to not
helpful to peace uh the international
institutions Security Council
International court of justice the rest
of the world say simply illegal criminal
all with us support all exactly like
this uh it is true as Ambassador Ross
said that Israel pulled out of Gaza of
Sinai in 1979 actually 198 too uh the
reason was they were exactly what I said
there was a proposal they were offered
full peace in
1971 if they withdrew from siai they
refused with us support that led to the
1973 War it was a very close call for
Israel a danger to the world after that
come years of negotiations they finally
accepted what they rejected in 1971 one
that was the withdrawal from
Sinai uh what about
Gaza there were several four six 7,000
Israeli settlers in Gaza taking up some
30 or 40% of the land substantial part
of the resources million and a half
people there large part of the Israeli
Army protecting them shiron made the
sensible decision from the position of
Israeli Hawks that this was pointless
and they should move those settlers to
Illegal settlements in the West Bank the
Israeli Army left Gaza in
October 2005 The Siege continued to
brutal Siege and military action
succeeded January
1976 okay a couple months later came the
free election and the US Israeli
stepping up harshly stepping up the
attack on Gaza by June of that year
Israel had already uh attacked Gaza with
7700 Rockets these are serious Rockets
they're not things made in the backyard
that was by June then it stepped up
still further then came the aborted coup
stepped up still further that's not a
withdrawal Gaza remains Under
Siege severe Siege the Gaza fishermen
are are not permitted to go more than 3
or four kilometers offshore which means
they can't fish because Israel has
destroyed the sewage and power plants so
it's all hopelessly polluted uh the
border Israel has taken a substantial
part of the internal borders of Gaza
those are called zones in which
Palestinians are not allowed to enter if
they do they get shot at and killed uh
there's the the place now it's even
worse because the military government in
Egypt has largely shut off the one entry
point but the siege remains bitter
brutal that's a war in some periods like
cast lead it was a shocking horrifying
War bitterly condemned
by the entire world again outside the
United States and as I said reviewed in
detail by Amnesty International Human
Rights Watch Gold un commission you can
read it and see well uh when we look at
the situation now let's take a look at
the settlement blocks the settlement
blocks break up you look at their
current map they break up the West Bank
into unviable
cantons uh they are all illegal there's
no question of leaving the settlement
blocks under Israeli control that's like
saying if I say you know I conquer your
house and then I leave and decide I'll
I'll take the main rooms you can have
the rest that's not a settlement a
settlement is get out of my house you
know that's uh and that's what happened
in uh
196 now I'll end up simply by saying
that I think Ambassador Russ gave a a
very accurate uh account of the Israeli
government position of what they believe
and would like people to believe but
that's just the problem as long as the
United States is the partisan of Israel
is the supporter of Israel negotiations
in which the United States uh organizes
them are senseless I mean it's as if uh
there are conflicts in Iraq between the
Shia and the Sunni suppose somebody said
well fine let's let Iran uh run
negotiations to settle them the United
States is a participant in the conflict
you could hear that from Ambassador
Russ's depiction of it us is a
participant stands alone against the
world with Israel against the
international the security Council the
court of
justice the huge International consensus
which includes everyone and as long as
that continues uh prospects for peace
are very
[Applause]
dim first I do want to say there is
one you
okay I know
I mean you're already wearing a
cast all right um I do want to say there
is one historical fact on which we agree
so just so you can leave here and say
gee there was actually one historical
fact on which they
agreed uh I do think one of the
historical mistakes the Israelis made uh
and it was gold in my
ear and uh you can read about some of
rabin's angst over this at the time time
was the behavior in 71 not seeing saddat
that Sadat actually was making serious
proposals at the time Sadat is in fact
was the one Arab leader later King
Hussein but one Arab leader who was
prepared to actually make
initiatives
now let me make a a second broad
point the essence of what you're saying
is as long as the US is involved in any
peacemaking it'll never
happen you know one of the interesting
things is when I was a negotiator the
Europeans used to come to me all the
time and say how come you keep us out of
the negotiations why are you keeping us
out of the negotiations and I said to
them I have never kept you out of the
negotiations it is not me who's keeping
you out of the
negotiations you know if the Israelis
and the Palestinians want you in you're
in the negotiations whether I want you
in or or I don't want you in and if the
Israelis and Palestinians don't want you
in even if even if I want you in in you
won't be in now the fact of the matter
is you know they didn't I can understand
the Israelis but the
Palestinians didn't open up to
them at this
time now they made a
judgment that they wanted us to play
this
role you know when I I talked about
speaking in Gaza when I spoke to uh a
few months before the Israeli
withdrawal uh and when I said here was a
great
opportunity for the Palestinians in Gaza
to show the world and to show the
Israeli
public uh what it
meant uh and you
know I said at the time because I was
speaking to obviously many who were not
just fata but members of the opposition
as well I said I know you don't think
the United States is an honest
broker I said the United States has a
special relationship with Israel that's
true and it will always have a special
relationship with Israel it doesn't mean
that it can't have a relationship with
you and a good relationship with you the
truth is in any negotiation what you
want is an effective broker that's what
matters you know whenever you hear
someone say well we don't like the
honest broker what they want is they
want someone who's on their side but
brokers in the end can't produce
agreements unless they respond to the
needs of both sides you know frequently
when the US is is mediating we're trying
to find out what is the essence of each
side's needs and because we have the
relationship with the Israelis who do
you think is the one who's then trying
to move the Israelis it's the US and
that's been the case throughout one of
the interesting Dynamics uh and I'm
doing a book right now on the history of
the US Israeli relationship one of the
interesting dynamics that you can find
going back by the way to 1971 there's an
exchange that Kissinger has with Ian and
rabine
after yaring has posed his questions and
Sadat has responded to the questions and
the Israelis haven't and kisser says to
ibon and Rabin why can't you tell us
what you can do we're your friends tell
us and the dynamic is one that gets
repeated over and over and over again
because the Israelis hear us and they
say whatever we tell you will never be
enough because you're going to try to
satisfy the
Arabs the essence of mediation is trying
to find ways to reconcile both sides
needs not only one side's needs when you
say about the issue of you know I don't
want you in my house get out of my house
it's fine to get out of the house but
when you get out of the house and then
you get shot at after you get out of the
house it makes you rather hesitant to
get out of the house now the truth is
having withdrawn unilaterally twice from
Lebanon having withdrawn from Gaza each
time after having withdrawn not God
not having gotten security you know
having gotten when you talked about the
the Rockets the Israelis fire in if you
number the rockets that have been fired
into Israel from Gaza and that were
fired in the 2006 war from Lebanon those
number in the in the thousands and
thousands of rockets as well the issue
of settlement blocks is legitimate from
one standpoint because it's going to be
compensated the whole idea of 67 and
mutual greed swaps is that all right
there will be a way to accommodate the
settlers in settlement blocks that'll
become part of
Israel and in return for that you
compensate the Palestinians with
territory that is presently
Israel so you get a
compensation it isn't the case that in
fact you know outside the blocks the
settlements remain what is a case is
that you may this is a way you can deal
with the fact that you have uh a way to
accommodate those settlers who could
remain who live close to what was the
green line the green line was what
existed on June
467 so if you can accommodate that by
say 5% of the West Bank and then you
compensate for that that is a way to
address the needs of both sides and when
you're trying to deal as I said with a
conflict of this sort if you address one
side's needs there isn't peace
all right so we have plenty of time for
Q&A um I'm going to turn it over to the
moderator Peter
MCL go good afternoon thank you all for
coming
um this part is what I hope will be one
of the most constructive and one of the
most enjoyable portions of the evening
which will be the Q&A session but before
we begin I want to lay a few brief
parameters
uh one is that I ask that we limit the
mics to three people in line that just
for the sake of visibility so that
people can see back uh in the back of
the auditorium so three in line please
at a time uh secondly as is easy to do
at Brown University we often confuse
length with Insight so
please please keep your questions brief
and that's really for the purpose of
getting as many questions asked as we
can um with that I'm going to begin with
the young lady on the left
um I think you were first oh
okay um hi my name is Raa I'm a senior
here and I'd like to thank um Professor
Chomsky and Dr Ross or Ambassador Ross
for coming so I had one question that I
don't know if either of you addressed
which is the Cold War and I'd like to
call since Ambassador Russ raised
Professor chomsky's credentials in the
beginning I'd like to raise your
credentials now as well you graduated
with a degree in Soviet
decision-making so I'd like to ask why I
guess you believe that the United States
should continue a practice of supporting
what is essentially upon in a cold war
conflict into a post Cold War
era could say it again why okay sorry
let me clarify um so and just to clarify
I know you said let length really but I
guess as a student no you you were you
were so succinct that I didn't quite
understand what you're getting so
explain it so I had I had one um serious
issue with a comment you made about
identity and how the conflicts in the
Middle East right now um Israel is
living in a tough neighborhood and you
know it's racked the Middle East is
racked by these primordial kind
conflicts of identity and you know can't
Israel is therefore the only stable
Haven of democracy in the Middle East
but if you look at the history of how
that democracy came into being how that
democracy came into being and if you
look at the history of how those
authoritarian leaders in those states
were put in place it's it's in
inextricably connected with the Cold War
and with Soviet and us decision- making
so I'm I'm I'm struggling to understand
why we continue to act as if the entire
Arab world you use the word Arab and you
use the the word Arabs in Palestine
which first of all is extremely
ethnocentric and and I mean painful in a
[Applause]
sense but why we why why should we
continue to act as if we're in this you
know epic war with a Soviet power and
we're the on the other side and this is
our
playground okay I got it thank
you no I look I I wanted to be sure I
understood what you were asking and
really sorry but
go you were Fair uh
a I would say that um I don't think US
policy towards the Middle East today is
driven by a cold war
mentality uh it is true if you go back
if you actually look at President
Obama's speech that he gives in Cairo in
June of 2009 one of the things he says
is that uh the US approached us and the
West approached the region through a
cold war approach for too long and and
that helped and we treated too many of
those in the region as proxies for us I
don't think that's the nature of our
approach today and when I was trying to
suggest what's going on in the region
right now uh there are conflicts that
are driven by tribe Clan and sect
today now what the US does in this
region I think has to be driven by a
combination of values and interests
that's usually what drives American
foreign policy
you view the creation of Israel as a
crime correct no I don't actually I
think that's a harmful assumption but
I'm and I'm saying I I'm
actually I'm actually hold on R Rea wait
one second we're going to try and limit
dialogue between all right I know
Ambassador Ross asked the question but
just for future we're going to try and
limit dialogue no I don't I don't I
don't want to I don't want to
mischaracterize you either I'm sorry I
don't want to mischaracterize you really
yeah that's that's it that's all right
there's a cqu going on which is kind of
interesting but okay I um look I think
the American approach to the
region is in the long term will be best
served if it's driven by our Embrace of
a certain set of values that's true is
it always easy for us to do that without
regard to our interests no it's not so
easy to do that with regard without
regard to our interests but I don't
believe that today we're approaching
this even though Vladimir Putin is doing
his best to recreate the Soviet Union I
don't believe that we are approaching
this through a cold war mindset I think
we're struggling to deal with how to
cope with a region that's going to be
characterized by aaval for some time to
come well I here we have a measure of
agreement I also don't think that uh
policy is driven by a cold war mentality
but in fact I don't think it ever was uh
just take a look at the facts so for
example I'm take
1989 when the Soviet Union was
collapsing Berlin Wall Phil you know
it's finished what was the US policy
well I quoted it it was the baker plan
December 1989 read it what it says is
there can be no additional Palestinian
state in addition to Jordan which we
declare to be a Palestinian State
despite what they think uh there can be
no additional Palestinian State between
Jordan and Israel and the outcome of the
occupied territories must be settled
according to the guidelines of the uh
state of Israel James Baker went on to
add that Palestinians could take part in
negotiations as long as they accepted
that it's going to that their role is to
accept the Israeli guidelines that's
when Russia was Soviet Union was
collapsing nothing about the Cold War I
won't go through the earlier record but
it's the same and up until today uh
there's no Cold War and the policy gets
harsher and harsher uh if you look
back and let's ask whether it's driven
by values actually I don't think great
powers ever act in terms of their
professed values everyone professes all
kind of wonderful values look at the
facts so take say the Arab world there
has been one free election one
January 2006 in Palestine free election
how did the US react well it reacted by
punishing the harshly punishing the
Palestinians because they voted the
wrong way they voted a way we didn't
like so therefore the US and of course
Israel imposed harsh sanctions escalated
the attack on Gaza and expanded
settlement in the West Bank and prepared
a military coup to overthrow the
government uh inly there are people who
understand this it's useful to look at
the attitude towards us held by others
it's not enough just to look at a mirror
and say how beautiful we are so what do
Arabs think for example about our value
of democracy you can find that out
there's regular polls by the leading us
polling agencies of a I in the Arab
world they happen to be collected
conveniently in a recent book by sh
shibl talhami is Professor runs most of
these uh one of the questions it's asked
is among in the Arab world is uh what's
your attitude do you
support is their attitude towards the US
policy of what's called democracy
promotion you know what percentage of
Arabs take it seriously
5% the rest
dismiss it they say the US is following
great power interests wants to control
the oil of the Arab world wants to
dominate it and so on 5% agree with the
official US line we're pursuing our
value of democracy uh are we pursuing
peace well we can find out about that
too uh last December for example there
was a an international poll run by the
main polling agencies Gallup in the
United States it's part in England one
of the questions that was asked is which
country is the greatest threat to World
Peace the United nobody else was even
close the United States was far in the
lead Pakistan was way behind nobody
practically nobody else was mentioned
well what is the all right about 10 more
seconds Professor that's the world what
do they know uh of course Americans
don't know this for a good reason there
was not a single report about it in the
United States it's considered
insignificant what do we care what the
world thinks uh what do we care what the
Arab world thinks about our attitude
toward democracy we just look at
ourselves and Pat ourselves on the back
about how we pursue our values thank you
and uh we're going to move right here on
the right to the next question please
great uh first of all I want to say
thank you to the students who organized
the Janice Forum uh thank you for giving
us this opportunity we really appreciate
it
uh my name is Cliff whitesman I'm a
sophomore here at Brown uh I want to
start by also thank you thanking you
guys uh Ambassador Ross and Professor
Chomsky for coming to speak to us today
uh I really appreciate the opportunity
to learn from you even though I don't
necessarily agree with some of your
opinions um so I grew up in Israel I
moved to the US when I was 13 and after
Shalon gave away uh massive amounts of
Gaza to Palestinians I experienced some
of that back backlash when
okay when Hamas sent uh Kasam Rockets I
was carrying in a basement and afraid of
getting hit same thing goes for All My
Siblings um a lot of this speech has
been about allocating blame I think
that's the wrong way to go because both
sides are wrong and the goal here is to
find a solution I want from both of you
to hear what you think should be a
solution in my opinion Jordan is 50%
Palestinian by origin uh no chsky is
amazing at Linguistics and a lot of the
facts he put out uh may appear true but
they're not
um same thing goes for clearing the Gaza
Strip so I want to hear how do you guys
think we can solve this problem not okay
so the question is what is your ideals
of a
solution well pretty simple the world
has had a Sol the the basic Contours of
a solution have been accepted by the
entire world with the exception of the
United States and Israel and I think
they're pretty sensible for I don't I
think it's an ugly solution but probably
the best shortterm one uh everyone knows
what it is which is two states set it's
exactly it's pretty much what was
presented in the 1976 Security Council
resolution that the US vetoed two- State
settlement on the international border
uh we could with to take the official US
wording in the earlier years with minor
and mutual
modifications uh it was a ceasefire line
so you straighten out the line and so on
uh guarantees for the secur for the
right I'll quote again the right of each
state in the region to exist in peace
and security within secure and
recognized borders that is now the
position of essentially the entire world
did both sides ratify this like agreed
did both sides Israel and pal 30 more
seconds Professor Israel rejected it the
United States vetoed it pal age to it
pardon did Palestine agree to it
Palestinians supported it
Hamas we're going to have to cut you off
there this is
1976 was noas
theas was not accepting we'll get to you
in a second Ambassador r one i' like to
know hamas's position their official
position you can read it in the was in
in the Washington Post the New York
Times and so on is that they would
accept this position they would accept a
state
in the currently occupied territories
with East Jerusalem as its capital thank
you now Ambassador
that's Mich you know that's their
official position they don't like it but
they said they'd accept it what Hamas
has said as they would accept a
long-term truce no they also said that
was my in addition they said they would
accept term truce Israel rejects it all
it wants to maintain
to to incorporate integrate within
Israel the areas that it wants within
the territories they're not adjacent to
the Border take a look at
malim it's bound which was built in the
1990s mainly it's boundaries extend to
virtually to Jericho they cut right
across the West I get a chance yep go
ahead Professor you asked a question
about what the solution is look I any
solution that is based upon moral
suasion we know one about the Middle
East moral suasion doesn't work just
look at
Syria so what I would say a there is no
the reason I don't agree with you that
Jordan is the answer is because the
Palestinians have a separate national
identity and there's only one way to
solve this conflict it's to two states
for two peoples there are two national
movements these are two national
movements that have been competing for
the same space so you have to have two
states for two National movements the
Jewish people get self-determination in
a part of historic Palestine the
Palestinian people get
self-determination in a part of historic
Palestine the logic of what I said
before was 67 and mutually agreed swaps
you will probably have settlement blocks
of you know uh Omar wanted
6.3% and he was prepared to compensate
basically the equivalent 5.8% territory
from Israel and then use the connection
between and Israel to make up for the
rest you're going to end up with
something that looks like that you're
going to have security Arrangements the
security Arrangements some of which will
be extended for a longer period of time
the security Arrangements should be
driven by conditions and
performance you know we can pick certain
times but for sensitive areas
particularly given all the unknowns in
this region right now performance and
conditions should shape this and that
way you end up with what's going to be
two states for two peoples you're going
to end up with Jerusalem being undivided
but a cap but a capital for the israelit
a capital for the
Palestinians the you know the way to
deal with the refugee question is that
the right of return for refugees will be
to their state not to Israel the
Israelis will be treated like third
countries that they will be they will
allow some Palestinians to return
probably under humanitarian
rubric uh that's the way you're going to
resolve this
and now you know it takes it's it's easy
to say and hard to do the level of
distrust between the two sides goes
beyond the issue of distrust it's
disbelief there's a loss of faith on
each side you know Palestinians asked
the question if the Israelis are really
committed to two states why are they
building and what should be our state
and Israelis asked the question if the
Palestines really believe in two states
uh how come you can't find a map in the
Palestinian Authority with Israel on it
how come you know they can't they can't
agree to the idea that two states means
their state but also then a state of the
Jewish people so each side then
convinces themselves of why the other
isn't committed the key to peacemaking
right now is not just to figure out a
way how you negotiate on the core issues
how do you get each side to address the
sources of disbelief on the other about
commitment to two states so what can the
Israelis do to prove to the Palestinians
that they you know when they say they
are committed to two states that their
behavior reflects it one way would be
don't build except in the blocks that
will end up being part of Israel and for
the Palestinians one way is to say look
we accept there's two states for two
peoples these are two national movements
and there won't be a Reconciliation
until both sides have a state thank you
thank you
both on the left go ahead hello my name
is Katherine I'm a senior con in willly
studies here we could debate the causes
of the conflict and assign blame to both
sides add nauseum but Ambassador Russ
I'm glad you brought up the distinction
between values and interests because I
was wondering what are America's
strategic interests in the region and
how does America's support for Israel
impact the pursuit of those
interests I can tell you with the way
we've defined them
historically we've defined them in terms
of ensuring the uh free flow
of an access to
oil um we Define them in terms
of uh our commitment to Israel's
security we've defined them in terms
of uh dealing with potential sources of
Terror uh and we've wanted to make
certain that no foreign power could gain
some kind of basic leverage over the
region that's the way it's been defined
historically
now one question that might be embedded
in what you're asking is does the fact
that the United States is becoming
increasingly independent when it comes
to oil is that going to change America's
interest in the region that's not what
you're asking but I'm just commenting no
you I think what you were getting at is
does our relationship with Israel harm
us uh in the Arab world is that what
you're getting at that's exactly what
I'm getting at
yes um well uh I think that there has
been an embedded assumption throughout
it goes back actually to before the time
that Israel existed William Eddie who
was The Interpreter for Franklin delanor
Roosevelt when he met with iben sa in
the great Peter lakes in February
1945 wrote him a memo and basically said
to him that we won't ever have
friendship with the Arabs they won't do
anything with us if we
support uh a Jewish state in the area
what's interesting is uh the fact is
when we did those Arab states that we
had a relationship with we still had a
relationship with I'll cite you another
interesting example I'm not saying that
it doesn't put Arab states doesn't
complicate the relationship at times or
make them defensive about the
relationship but to give you an example
in
1963 the United States was providing
$44.5 Million worth of arms to five Arab
States in 1968 the same five Arab states
we were providing $995 Million worth of
arms after the 1967 war there wasn't one
of those Arab states that wanted us to
stop the provision of the arms because
they saw the arms as being a symbol of
the connection and What mattered for
them first and foremost was their
security and they looked at the
connection to us as being Central to
their security so the US relationship
with Israel certainly affects the
psychology and the climate with within
many Arab states
but there's also an interesting reality
what their priorities are tends to be
their security uh and in the first
instance if you look at a country like
Saudi Arabia today and you ask them what
are their two preoccupations today more
second and the other is the Muslim
Brotherhood Israel doesn't rank up there
as highly as you might
think thank you go ahead hi this is for
Ambassador Ross um I'm going back to the
point uh you you know that's already
mentioned actually but um how in a tough
neighborhood Israel is essentially you
know a very free state and I'm wondering
you know based on American values um and
based on your own experience how America
justifies Itself by supporting a state
that just instituted segregated busing
systems or um you know that as me as an
American citizen you know born and bred
cannot fly into Israel on a plane
because I am Palestinian um or you know
the military occupation that is
happening and I just want to know based
on values on this country's values how
we justify supporting another country
that does not you know adhere to those
values well one of the things
[Applause]
I you know one of the things I was
suggesting is obviously the relationship
with with the Palestinians today and the
nature of the occupation today creates a
set of complications for sure but we
look at this state and as I said
this is a state that is a democratic
state it does embody a set of democratic
values many of the things that it does
with the Palestinian Palestinians still
have access to Israeli courts you know
look it's a is it is the occupation
something that creates real problems for
the Palestinians of
course has there been an effort to
negotiate peace yes does does Israel
embody a set of values uh in terms of
how it organizes itself runs itself in
terms of the things I was describing
with regard to free elections and Free
Press yes so you know one of the reasons
that is the United States supports
Israel because fundamentally it is a
democracy in a region where democracy
doesn't
exist thank you Gentleman on the left
please uh hello my question is uh why do
you think uh United States is the right
broker because uh based on the polls
Professor jsky mentioned I don't think
Palestinian people trust in uh the US
and then uh they I think they look at it
as like a more of a de destabilizer of
the region uh attacking countries in the
region or and the the fact that you said
it's an effective broker uh so like I
don't think it's an effective broker
because there haven't been a a deal in I
think couple of decades and then uh they
can't be they can't even pursue uh their
their side like Israel to stop building
uh settlements thank
you well
obviously uh I think that you know the
United
States has been sought by both sides to
be the
broker you know why is it that other
countries aren't able to play the role
it's not because we prevent
them I gave the example the 19 1990s
that the you know I didn't prevent the
Europeans from being able to play a
role so you know one of the reasons that
I think that the
Palestinians uh and other Arab leaders
look to the United States is because
they look to us and they think we're the
one country that probably can influence
the Israelis because we have a
relationship and others they think can't
so you know it's not simply that the
United States arrogates to itself the
role it's that others even in the region
have wanted us to play the role and that
helps to explain it you know do I wish
that we could have succeeded by now yeah
I do but I also recited examples from
history where there were opportunities
that weren't seized
upon and you can't you know the end of
the day uh the US can't force peace and
can't impose peace the US can try to
help bring it about
I think we've tried you know obviously
we haven't succeeded But ultimately
piece is made between the
parties thank you Gentleman on the right
hey uh I'm David katovich I'm a
sophomore Brown and I have a quick
question but you give me a second uh
Professor tomsky I want to say from the
bottom of my heart a very personal thank
you it was your Works um profits of her
people manufacturing consent uh how the
world works that we're all right let's
get to that quick question I will come
in a moment uhat for my political
Awakening and very very personal thank
you honor to see you speak today uh my
question is for both of you what is your
view on the boycott investment sanctions
movement uh in in America and across the
world what's my view on the boycott
investment sanctions well it depends how
they're used so for example suppose that
there are let's take the European Union
European Union has recently taken the
position that it will not enter into
dealings with Israeli institutions that
are involved in maintaining the
occupation okay that amounts to saying
we will not participate in criminal
acts okay and it is a criminal act the
occupation as I said there's no doubt
about that uh so I think that makes
sense I think the European Union made a
sensible took a sensible whether they'll
implement it or not is another question
but they took a sensible stand if people
here say
boycott uh a company that's producing
from the West Bank same story it's
saying we will not participate in
criminal acts I think that makes perfect
sense there are other kinds of uh
tactics that I don't think make sense or
are principle you have to ask what they
are you can't say anything General about
boycott the vate and sanctions depends
how it's
targeted I don't favor it because if you
look at it what it calls for in fact is
a one-state
outcome BDS about a one state outcome no
that's not true yes they are look at
what their principles are the European
Union did not call for one state his
question was about BDS I'm asking the
question about BDS sorry he was talking
about the tactics there is something
that calls itself a BDS movement that's
a separate question that was his
question and I'm responding was about
Omar barti was your question about Omar
barouti Professor chsky I'll return to
you for a couple minutes afterward your
question was uh both the tactics not not
just in terms of
uh things that work in the settlements
but also say companies like locked
Martin that support this also companies
say like locked Martin that support the
occupation uh and also the movement
itself which you mean the BDS movement
the BDS movement has no you know if if
you read Omar baruti who defines himself
as a SP spokesman yeah he says something
many of the people in the BDS movement
say they would like a one state
settlement but that's not the question
of BDS
tactics well I responding to the
question that said what do you think of
the BDS movement my response is that
they favor one state outcome have you
found have you found a formal statement
from Omar ruti saying that he's the one
VDS movement saying I insist one state
he has a principle it says there needs
to be a right of Return of all refugees
to is he say he would like that but
you're the one who asked the question so
tell us are you interested in the BDS
tactics or are you you're interpreting
the question
the tactics of boycott investment
sanctions what they can do uh in terms
of situ the tactics largely of boycott
investment sanctions as a means of
achieving peace yeah your in the tactics
if you talk about the movement it
there's really no organized movement
there are a couple of people who call
themselves the spokes
persons any any approach and the BDS one
of the principles of BDS is one state
solution aside what is your view on the
tactics of boycott divestment sanctions
well that's like
saying that that's like saying Mrs
Lincoln other than what you saw how was
the play you know
um I think there's a
very there's a very simple why not be
concador let's be concrete should we
boycott factories that are producing in
the west Ambassador r i want you address
both both not only your views on the
tactics of BDS but what your
understanding of BDS is and then I'll
return to Professor Chomsky for your
understanding okay so I'm starting by by
saying any movement that supports a
one-state outcome is favoring an
enduring conflict there is no state in
this region where there is more than one
clear national identity that is at peace
and if you want to bring an enduring
conflict to the region then you'll favor
a one-state outcome I don't favor that
now as for the tactics I also don't
think that it will be
effective Professor chumsky can you
speak briefly about your understanding
of the BDS movement and then also your
qualification of it as in what tactics
do you believe are effective and what
are not I'm sorry I couldn't hear so
basically what your understanding of the
BDS movement is as it seems to differ
from Ambassador Ross's I can't talk
about the BDS movement because it
doesn't exist there is no organized BDS
movement there are people who call
themselves spokespersons for it like
Omar baruti is the main one right the op
beds uh if they to talk about a
one-state solution in my opinion is just
a total was of time on the two options
right now there are two options not one
state one option is the international
consensus the world minus the United
States and Israel that's one option the
other option is that the Israel will
continue doing exactly what it's doing
with us support you can see what it is
it's no secret it's pretty much what I
described essentially integ ating into
Israel what slowly whatever Parts they
regard as valuable excluding
Palestinians who will be left in cantons
with a nice town in ramala for the elite
and imprisoned essentially while Gaza
remains under harsh Israeli attack with
us support the talk about we ought to be
clear about what people to you keep
mentioning the Gaza Rockets Israel knows
precisely how to stop the the G CM
Rockets small Rockets come from gas very
simple accept a cease fire thank you I'm
going to cut you off there cuz the
question was remember what happened they
accept plenty of this is you can
document from Israeli sources okay it's
not controversial thank you gentlemen on
the left pleas may I may I say what it
was in June
2008 there was a
ceasefire is Israel was to Israel would
to stop its Massive Attack on Gaza and
Rockets would kasas would stop Rockets
it worked there was not a single Hamas
rocket read the Israeli government uh
you know website I'll tell you it one
not one until November 4th 2008 when
Israeli forces invaded Gaza uh killed
half a dozen Hamas militants at that
point some Hamas Rockets returned Israel
Rockets went back at vastly greater
scale there were casualties as always
all Palestinian in December 2008 Hamas
offered to renew the ceasefire called
for it to be renewed the ol mer cabinet
Mr Omar his cabinet considered it
rejected and instead launched operation
cast lead that's what happened if Israel
wants to stop the Rockets it knows how
thank you thank you pres go ahead on the
left thank you my question is for
Ambassador Ross I was wondering if you
can
characterize um what the caliber of Ally
Israel is given that uh according to the
Associated Press last year CIA views
Israeli mosad as the biggest threat to
us interests in the Middle East given
that Israeli uh offensive forces have
murdered US citizens Rachel Corey fan
Doan given that mad uses fake CIA and
this is according to foreign policy
magazine fake CIA identities when
recruiting operatives in the Middle East
given that Israel planes uh this is
according to lbj's White House Records
uh and 73 murdered 34 US service members
thank you go ahead Ambassador Ross rock
on uh I'm going to put you down as
undecided on this
question um look you know I can assure
you that the CIA doesn't view the
Israelis as a biggest threat in the
region having spent a lot of time in the
US government that's not the view of
people in the US government the CIA
operatives I speak with the case
officers disagree with you sir
respectfully well you know you can find
individuals who feel that way for
sure um but you know there are also you
know there are plenty of individuals on
the inside who feel just the opposite
who find that the sharing of
intelligence with the Israelis
preempting terrorist attacks uh
developing some of the military
capabilities which we've acquired from
the
Israelis uh there's a lot that the
Israelis have done for us that have
saved American lives uh some of the
tactics that we used uh in having to
both in in Iraq and
Afghanistan a lot of doctrinal things
there's many things that the Israelis
have contributed and many within the
many within different administrations
would say that from that standpoint
Israel contributes a lot to us anything
that not having to do all right we're
going to move on question on the right
sure yeah absolutely go ahead question
on the right please but I mean you know
look if you look at uh if you look at
the high-tech industry and Israel you
look at some of the medical Innovations
in Israel which are which we also
benefit from absolutely we could do a
long list of those thank you're welcome
um so the first part of my question is
for Professor chsky um while I agree
with your analysis that for far too long
the US has given this kind of support to
like blind check support to Israel that
I disagree with um I do think that the
US does can play a critical role in
leveraging the situation by um using
their support to get Israel to the table
and so I worry that if we turn it over
to if the US extracts itself from the
situation and we turn it over to direct
negotiations because of the current um
Power imbalance that would result in a
solution that's really unfair to
Palestinians um and so I want to ask you
how if the US were to remove itself from
the situation how would you um hope that
a two-state solution is achieved that is
just and sustainable for both parties
and to that end Ambassador Ross I want
to know how the US will actually play um
a role as an effective mediator which a
term you kind of talked about earlier
and especially um to that end distancing
itself or how can the US mediating team
operate without interference from the US
Congress which uh maybe to put it
politely sometimes has a misunder
understanding what the American Jewish
Community wants from certain
organizations thank you thanks Professor
chsky why don't you begin um last
Ambassador Ross so basically you
understood the question okay yeah sure
um negotiations look I think it's a very
thoughtful question and I think the I
think one of the things we have to do as
a as a
mediator is again focus on what I was
trying to get at when I was speaking
earlier the key to mediation is getting
each side to focus on the other side's
needs the last thing that each party
wants to do when they're dealing in a
negotiation is focus on the other side's
needs they only think about their side's
needs the role of the mediator is to
find ways to explain you're not going to
achieve what is important to you unless
you're able to address uh and ensure
that you satisfied what's important to
them our role at this point I think is
to do two things one is to to deal with
these sources of
disbelief if you create a climate where
there's complete disbelief and cynicism
on each side and one of the proofs of it
is look at the polls in Israel
today 69% of Israelis favorite two State
outcome and 91% believe it'll never
happen that's a function of disbelief in
cynicism on the Palestinian side the
polls are showing a disturbing Trend in
the past the Palestinians supported a
two-state outcome by figures that were
close to 75 to
80% there still is a majority but the
majority is now down into the low 50s
that's a function of also believing it
isn't going to happen and losing faith
in the possibility of it one of our most
important roles is to try try to
demonstrate that it can be done and one
of the things that has to happen is to
address as I was getting at the sources
of disbelief if Palestinians see a set
of Israeli behaviors that convince them
that it'll never happen then how do we
address those behaviors to change those
so that they Palestinians see something
different if Israeli public sees the
same thing on the Palestinian side that
convinces them that Palestinians will
never really accept Israel then what do
we do to try to change that perception
what can we get the Palestinians to do
and you won't get you need to create a
kind of parallelism I have long favored
what I call coordinated unilateralism
truth is I talked to chirome before he
withdrew from Gaza and I said to him the
problem with the unilateral withdrawal
is you're going to end up benefiting the
side that is most in favor of resistance
meaning
Hamas you need we need two things you
need those who believe in in cooperation
with Israel they need to be seen as the
ones who deliver this withdrawal number
one and number two it can't be only
Israel that has responsibilities
Palestinians have to see that they have
responsibilities as well this should be
coordinated unilateralism if if you
pursue what I'm suggesting which is not
only negotiations on the core issues but
specifically a a list of steps that each
side might take that they would
coordinate between the two of them that
would send a signal to the other that
what they doubt about the other side is
being
addressed that would be a very useful
role for us to play as a
mediator thank you Professor
chsky
um the the the question of perceptions
let's take a look at the perceptions on
both sides
uh Palestinians see that Israel occupies
Palestine they see that Israel is
viciously attacking Gaza they see that
it is anex the Golan Heights and
violation of Security Council orders
they see developments taking place all
the time on the ground splitting the
country up into cantons making life
unlivable turning g into a prison that's
what they see there's a way to end those
perceptions stop doing it what they see
in the United States is the US fully
supports it the US provides the economic
military uh diplomatic support like I
gave a of the vetos and so on that
continues it to allows it to continue
that's what they see about the United
States and that's why an overwhelming
majority in the Arab world regard the
United States as the greatest threat
they face there's a reason for that
because of its actions right not its
nice rhetoric everyone has nice rhetoric
they see the actions well what are the
perceptions that the Israeli that bother
the
Israelis how Palestine the Palestinians
formally accepted Israel in
1988 formally accepted it take a look at
the PNC uh uh declaration there's
nothing more to say they accepted it in
fact uh for they'd accepted it tacitly
before but forly in
1988 the Israeli us reaction which I've
quoted was to say that Jordan's already
a Palestinian State and you can't have
another one okay I do have to correct
that you this is just factually not true
let quote it let me quote it no but I'm
you're you look it up may
1989 is the Israeli response December
1989 is the baker plan look it up the
baker plan had five points
Onish I will tell you what the baker
plan said
it repeat I wrote
it you wrote it so therefore you know
that it specifically not say anything
about Jordan zero it had to do with an
Israeli Palestinian dialogue in the
territories not one word about it was
carefully written by a diplomat to try
to conceal what it said what it said is
here's what it said take a look I can
tell you I'm not that good Diplomat
endorse the Israeli position it did not
it's take a look look it up we're going
to agree to disagree on this point
Professor chsky I'm going to give you
one more minute to finish pleas endorse
the Israeli position which was there
cannot be an additional Palestinian
state that language does not exist in
anything that Baker presented no he said
we endorsed the Israeli position which
says this no that didn't look it up no
there is no endorsement of the Israeli
position there look it up he said we
accept the Israeli position I I'm
interested in knowing who would
implement or who would create a
two-state solution what like you say you
support a two-state solution I'm curious
how you think we would get there that
was my question how didn't understand
very briefly professor chumsky she wants
you to address how we would achieve a
two-state
solution how would they achieve a
two-state solution two minutes please
how would they achieve a two-state
depends what kind of two-state solution
so Israel would be happy with a
two-state solution which allows them to
take over the parts of the occupied
territories that they they
are systematically integrating into
Israel with us support and leave a
couple of cantons around uh that could
be called Palestine actually this
proposal was made the first Israeli
Prime Minister to support a two-state
solution was Benyamin
Netanyahu when he took office in
1996 his minister of information was
asked by the Press would you accept the
two-state solution
and he said yes uh we're going to leave
something to the
Palestinians and they can call it a
state if they want or they can call it
fried
chicken that's the kind of two-state
solution that Israel would accept
there's another kind of two-state
solution the one which the world has
been advocating since the
1970s uh which the Palestinians
explicitly supported which Hamas
endorses
which calls for a settlement on the
international border with minor and
mutual modifications that's Us official
terminology uh uh and
then a resolution a fair resolution of
the refugee problem that's a separate
question and there's no real
difficulties about what that would be it
would be pretty much what Ambassador
Ross mentioned that's those those are
the options thank you the alternative is
that Israel will continue with full us
support to do precisely what it is now
doing and we don't have to debate about
that because you can read about it step
by step daily okay thank you and um
unfortunately due to our time
constraints that's going to be the last
question and I just want to close with a
few remarks before we break um one
more the
the Janice Forum today is able to
provide the space for students to come
out to hear our two speakers today and
as much as we appreciate their presence
unfortunately we don't have the
privilege of having them every day and
these are conversations that have been
started here today that both speakers
have presented that the audience has
engaged with in the hopes of this
conversation continuing around campus uh
this is simply the first step in what we
hope will be a fruitful discussion
around campus that will continue through
all your times at Brown and the Janice
for is able to host events such as this
because of student involvement and
because of student interest so with that
being said I just want you all I want to
invite all of you to submit ideas to
Janice for future events and finally
let's give a big round of applause to
our two speakers
