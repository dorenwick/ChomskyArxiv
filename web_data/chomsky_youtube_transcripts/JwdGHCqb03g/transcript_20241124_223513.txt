how are you good to see you
[Music]
there's something nice SW down
[Music]
there
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah get it as high above the sweater as
you can cuz it's t to road yeah
definitely don't want yeah so we can
just start right in uh years ago you
wrote an article or an essay called
responsibility of intellectuals so we'll
start there and move on to all sorts of
other topics um the first problem with
that title was what's an intellectual so
what is an intellectual it's not a term
I use very much but it's a term that's
used it refers to people who U have suff
sufficient uh privileg
and opportunity so that they're able to
uh speak uh about Affairs of human
interest and concern and do it with a
degree of prestige and Authority which
may or may not be
warranted uh and uh uh they are called
intellectuals so a physicist working in
a lab is not called an intellectual but
if he happens to give a talk on you know
nuclear proliferation yeah then he's an
intellectual uh a literary critic who
writes about uh English poets and the
late 19th century is not an intellectual
but uh if he happens to uh uh discuss uh
you know the cultural changes that are
uh developing in the modern in the
modern world well okay then he is an
intellectual uh if a u say a Shoemaker
uh happens to have a a very
insightful uh commentary on uh
International Affairs or domestic
affairs or human relations is usually
not called an
intellectual but it's it's not much it's
not a very meaningful
term nonetheless what's then an
intellectual responsibility the focus of
your essay we start with the fact that
the people designated as
intellectuals have
uh uh um privileges otherwise they
wouldn't enter into that category uh
they have a degree of authority Prestige
Justified or not and these um
characteristics confer
responsibility the more uh privileg
privilege yields
opportunity uh Prestige deserved or not
yields a degree of credibility uh the
more opportunity and uh uh credibility
you have the more responsibility you
have uh pretty straightforward like
almost
everything but but what's the nature of
the responsibility in other words if we
say that an intellectual is failing to
meet her responsibility what does that
mean we can start with some Elementary
moral principles that any decent human
being ought to accept that in fact most
people will say they accept uh so for
example one Elementary truism is that U
we should apply to ourselves the same
standards we apply to others if not more
rigid standards in fact should be more
rigid standards so one responsibility of
intellectuals is to uh look at the facts
of past and current history a look at
the actions of say our enemies and the
way we've treated them and look at
ourselves and the way we've treated
ourselves and then ask whether we are
meeting that Elementary moral condition
and that arises all the time so for
example there happens to be a an inquiry
going on in England where they're
investigating Tony Blair Jack straw and
others for their the background of their
involvement in the invasion of Iraq uh
there's no such inquiry in the United
States the United
States people with power and privilege
are immune from any inquiry or
discussion that's part of the uh part of
the prerogatives of Imperial power but
there is one in England well it's
Elementary that uh Blair was involved in
direct
aggression uh lawyers will try to uh
work their way out of that conclusion
but that's their job but it's Elementary
uh look at the definition of aggression
in say the nberg proceedings the general
assembly and so on yes it's invasion of
Iraq's a textbook case well there's a
way to deal with aggression when when it
when when its enemies carry it out in
fact that's what the nberg tribunal was
about it's the uh a gold standard for
how to deal with crimes of aggression
that was the major crime charged at
Norberg there were other crimes but uh
so for example
the German foreign minister fun rivr was
hanged uh one of the major charges was
uh uh that he was involved in a
preemptive War the Germans invaded
Norway and he was foreign minister so of
course he's in involved uh they invaded
Norway because they knew in fact it was
not a secret
that Britain was planning to use a base
in Norway to attack Germany So This
falls under what's called preemptive War
you carry out Military aggression to
stop uh an impending attack on yourself
and uh he was hanged well okay let's
take Colin
Powell before we go into this because
this will come up later I just want to
hang with the uh the intellectuals for a
second um to make it more concrete can
you give some examples of just a few or
as many as you want of people who you
think do fulfill the responsibility of
intellectuals let's say in the United
States or maybe um and and what makes
you say that about the particular person
what makes me say it is that they do the
specific people oh well let's take
Howard Zen who died recently or ekbal
Ahmed who died a couple years earlier or
Edward SED who died shortly before EO uh
well these are happen to be old personal
friends but they were also uh Edward and
ecel were very close friends eel and
Howard were close friends
and interacted constantly so they were
kind of a Cadre if you like of U
prominent intellectuals Scholars
activists their lives and their work
were intimately intertwined and they
dedicated a large part of their lives
and work to pursuing Elementary moral
truisms I could run through them but
that's what they did so okay that's
responsible intellectuals okay maybe a
way to to see it is some intellectuals
but not journalists because we're going
to get to journalism in a minute who
fail miserably um who have the prestige
who have the access who have all the
characteristics that you describe as
associated with being an intellectual
but who um don't meet their
responsibility violate it routinely
that's I mean I know there are a lot you
want to start from a we we'll go on for
the rest of the day it's virtually
everyone just give a uni a few specific
examples where you give the person on
the
instance all right let's take okay let's
take uh a couple of years ago U uh the
New York Times published some released
tapes Nixon tapes uh big battle about it
Henry Kissinger didn't want them
released I think there was a court trial
finally they were released and there was
an article about it if you look through
the tapes most of the disc it led to a
lot of discussion mostly gossip you know
nasty things Nixon said about somebody
or anti-semitic remarks or something but
there was one sentence that appeared in
in the article which as far as I could
see elicited no Comon at all except for
me and a couple other people uh it was a
it was a point where um they're talking
about the bombing of Cambodia and Nixon
kind of was ranting on about Cambodia
and he he told Kissinger his loyal
servant that he wanted him to relay
orders to the Pentagon about bombing of
Cambodia and Kissinger obediently did so
his words were something like this uh to
the military anything that flies against
anything that moves now if you look
through the archival
record of all states it's going to be
hard to find a call for genocide that's
so clear and explicit and it wasn't just
words because it happened uh few years
ago two leading Cambodia Scholars Taylor
Owen and Ben Kier
uh uh review published an article in
Canada in which they uh discussed uh uh
documents that had been released during
the Clinton years about the bombing of
Cambodia and it turns out that uh it was
known that the bombing was extremely
intense that was known right away uh
turns out it was five times as high as
what had been reported the bombing of
rural Cambodia was greater than the
total Allied bombing in all theaters
during World War II and as they point
out uh the bombing the effect of the
bombing was to turn the CH Rouge from a
kind of a marginal gorilla group that
nobody knew anything about uh to a mass
Army of what they call enraged peasants
who wanted to take revenge for this
monstrous atrocity well we know what
happened later okay so what how did
intellectuals react to this it's easy to
check the uh the Kieran uh Owen article
as far as I'm aware appeared once in the
United States namely on
znet uh I've never seen any other
mention of it as far as I know it
appeared nowhere in England uh the uh
and I doubt if it appeared anywhere else
it uh has never proceed any comment that
I've seen the Kissinger
remark disappeared was of no interest
there was no comment on it when it was
published in fact it was kind of like a
side remark in the article the gossip
was much more interesting uh and if you
check the record you'll find the same
actually I've brought it all of this up
repeatedly in talks to respectable
audiences you know uh the Royal
Institute of philosophy in uh England
which is deeply concerned with issues of
moral philosophy comparable groups here
uh special IST on Cambodia and journals
which are
which posture heroically about the
terrible Crimes of the C Rouge nobody
can hear the words I mean it's if you're
talking to a filter that cuts out
certain words and phrases now the
Kissinger remarks happen to be
approximately at the time when the
international tribunal uh was trying
milosevich
uh and um he died before the Judgment
but they were having a really hard time
putting together much of a case we could
go through the details of that they're
interesting but they were having a
pretty hard time it was mostly you know
as compared to the trivial with which
suppose they had found a statement from
mosovich saying anything that flies
against anything that moves there would
have been Euphoria all over the world
the Western world uh he'd immediately be
tried you know executed we'd talk about
how Noble we are and so on and so forth
okay now this is virtually 100% of
intellectuals I'm talking about so we
have a kind of a fact to explain there's
a relatively small number almost infant
tesmo uh of people
who um fulfill the responsibility of
intellectuals they use their their
credibility they use their their their
access they use their tools ET etc etc
to try and uh discuss reality in a way
that actually is consistent with human
well-being and consistency and so on
then we have virtually everybody who has
those attributes who has those
advantages who um is capable of
understanding when it serves their
interest so they'll they'll search
foreign wide for something about
somebody who they wish to prosecute um
but is completely incapable as you
described but even incapable of hearing
the words when it's contrary to this
background of Interest okay now it might
not matter cuz the fact is the crucial
thing but lots and lots of people hear
that and the and the way that they
dismiss it is to say it can't be
because what would explain it why would
all those people behave in such a way
how could they possibly have the mental
capacity to see the truth and not see
the truth not you know it must be the
small number of people who are confused
not the large number of people um how do
you answer that that is how do you how
do you explain the phenomenon being so
lopsided actually Orwell had a word for
it he called it double think a double
think is the capacity to hold two
contradictory ideas in mind and believe
them
both uh that's practically a defining
characteristic of intellectual history
uh secondly it is not I'm not talking
about the United States States as far as
I know this is close to historical
Universal right I find very few
exceptions and furthermore it goes back
to the earliest recorded history uh uh
furthermore every person who asks this
question knows the answer all they have
to do is look at themselves uh how many
people have failed to go through an
experience like for example when you're
you know 6 years old and uh your little
brother takes a toy and uh you want the
toy and your mother's not looking and
you're bigger than he is so you grab the
toy and then the kid starts yelling and
your mother comes in and she starts uh
centuring you for taking the toy and how
do you answer you say yeah I took the
toy cuz I wanted it and he's smaller
than me or he say look he didn't want
the toy anyway besides it was mine and
he really stole it from me so I was
right in other words can you know
anybody can you know who who anybody who
hasn't gone through such experiences in
their life and you get answer not the
first yeah so we all know the answer to
the question right you there are ways of
easy ways to rationalize whatever
happens in a usually complicated word
word uh uh the world so as to protect
yourself furthermore the fact that
intellectuals act like this is close to
topology you don't become a respected
intellectual unless you do this kind of
thing not
you know through not like Kissinger just
cility the master but because you
internalize it let's take a look at
history I me there are people who don't
do it uh small portion they're usually
uh are they uh are they praised are they
honored I mean they're usually treated
very badly uh depends on the nature of
the society uh they can be thrown out
their jobs in a civilized society like
ours they just get vilified and defamed
uh in a US possession like say El
Salvador they get their BL brains blown
out and nobody here even cares about it
or knows about it uh in say the post
stallin Soviet Union uh they got sent to
prison or exiled uh and if you go
through history furthermore it's kind of
striking that let's just take that last
example compare uh the old Soviet Union
you know pre Gorbachev uh post Stalin
different period pre Gorbachev uh and
compare say us possessions at the same
time actually we've just gone through a
very revealing incident about how
intellectuals react to that in November
2009 uh there W uh there was
enormous attention given to and
celebration of some very critical events
that took place exactly 20 years years
earlier in November
1989 in November 1989 the Berlin Wall
fell and quickly the Soviet Union
collapsed that was a major event in
world history that was a huge
commemoration of it on the 20th
anniversary that what was written about
it is mostly accurate and very revealing
it was heralded as a Triumph quoting
vatslav havell one of the heroes uh a
Triumph of love and nonviolence
uh love and nonviolence overcame the
Soviet Union and it collapsed and that's
the lesson we learned in fact there's uh
there's a generation of people who call
themselves The ners their uh
Consciousness was formed in November
1989 and they're dedicated to love and
nonviolence Obama's picked as the leader
and so on uh so that's what we learned
in November
1989 when the Soviet Union collapsed
well one week after the fall of the
Berlin Wall something else happened uh a
an elite Salvadoran Battalion which had
just come from several months of uh
training at the John F Kennedy Special
Forces school in Fort Brag and in fact
uh couple of days later had a special
group of I think a couple of dozen
Special Forces sent to El Salvador to
beef up their training uh this is the
top Battalion and the Salvadorian Army
the pride of the US run Salvadorian Army
uh right after that they U broke into
the
university uh they murdered uh six
leading Salvadoran intellectuals Jesuit
priests also their uh housekeeper and
her daughter uh in November 1989 1990
2009 uh a report was published in the
Spanish press easily accessible to
anyone in the Spanish press um
presenting the actual document that
ordered the assassination signed as had
been suspected but not proven signed by
the chief of staff and the top officials
in the Salvadorian Army all so close to
the Pentagon and the US Embassy that you
can barely find a ray of light between
them of course it was never published
here and never published in England and
so on so all that happened in
1989 well it wasn't just that's love and
nonviolence uh now it's not just the
killing of the Jesuit intellectuals the
killing of the Jesuit
intellectuals closed off a decade of
monstrous
atrocities in El Salvador maybe 70,000
people killed you know another 100,000
in Guatemala you who knows how many in
Nicaragua all carry all organized right
in Washington
a massive terrorist War the decade in Al
Salvador plenty of religious Martyrs in
fact the decade started with the
assassination of an Archbishop Reading
Mass by the same hands uh so it's not a
small event furthermore that understates
it uh there's a huge event that took
place uh it has to do with history of
the Catholic Church uh the Catholic the
church in the early centuries was
Radical pacifist that's why Christians
were persecuted because they were
Radical pacifists in the early 4th
Century going for our field I know it's
the same I know it's the same point
we're not going far I know it's the same
point okay uh and this is exactly to the
point in the 4th Century the radical
pacifist church was changed the emperor
Constantine took it over and turned it
into the Church of the Roman Empire so
the cross which had been a symbol of the
suffering of the poor was on the shield
of the Roman Empire well from the 4th
Century until almost today the church
was the Church of the rich and the
persecutors in
1962 Pope John the
23d uh changed it he called Vatican 2
big conference and that adopted what was
called the preferential option for the
poor it's from the Gospels and that led
to a movement par particularly in Latin
America where priests nuns lay people
others uh started bringing the message
of the gospels to um poor peasants and
trying to get them to think about their
horrifying conditions under us
dominated uh tyrannies and try to
organize to do something about it well
the US didn't wait long immediately it
reacted uh John F Kennedy organized a
military coup in Brazil one of the main
centers uh coup took place right after
the assassination was all set up by him
and Robert Kennedy uh that established
the first of the Neo-Nazi style National
Security States in Latin America you
know torture Massacre and so on and
Brazil's a big country so The Dominoes
started to fall uh and Country after
country fell under a plague of
repression uh that had no parallel since
the
Conquistadors Uruguay Chile and finally
ended up with Argentina maybe the worst
killers of them all and Reagan's
favorites and finally spread to Central
America in the 1980s then came these
hideous terrorist Wars uh throughout a
large part of it was a war against the
church and we know who was responsible
because they take pride in it so the
school of the the Americas now renamed
uh which trains Latin American Killers
you take a look at its talking points
advertising points uh it takes credit
for the fact as it says that the US Army
helped defeat Liberation theology that
is helped destroy the church the church
of the gospels that's not a small event
in history it's a rather significant
event in history and it was effectively
terminated by the massacre in November
1989 of course not totally there
residues you never kill ideas completely
is that a major event well take a look
and see how much commentary there was on
it I can give you 100% of the commentary
next to zero okay but I can even take
here in Boston where we are I know of
one discussion of it in Boston at Boston
College the Jesuit university where in
fact I was one of the speakers but one
of the speakers was Yan sabrino he's the
one surviving JZ
came up to give a talk a very good talk
what he pointed out and stressed was
that murdering the Jesuit intellectuals
was terrible enough but much worse was
murdering their housekeeper and daughter
who as he put it are the symbols of the
crucified populations of us
domains how many comments were there on
that well there actually was a comment
the uh uh
the uh the hero of Eastern Europe
vatslav havo that came to the United
States shortly after the murder of his
Jesuit colleagues in El Salvador and he
gave a speech to a joint session of
Congress and he got a rousing standing
ovation for calling the United States
the defender of
Freedom uh the Press was just and
commentators were totally euphoric
including the left uh so you know
Washington Post had editorials about why
can't we have amazing intellectuals like
this who uh tell us that we're the
defender of Freedom right having having
um slaughtered his counterparts and El
Salvador plus everything that came
before Anthony Lewis you know way out at
the far left of imaginable criticism uh
gushed about how we were in a romantic
age it's hard to believe it's a romantic
age and so on and so forth okay uh does
any of this enter history can it even be
comprehended in fact if you I've tried
to talk about it it blank W or else Fury
usually Fury and the reaction say oh
you're justifying atrocities you're
justifying Stalin you know yeah so the
picture
is even in the case of
of incredible barbarism um over extended
periods of time
time individuals who are intellectuals
meaning they've accured this this
respect and these tools and these
resources and so on for purposes of
advancing their own career and of being
taken seriously and of being
appreciated um sort of habitually almost
reflexively um follow the party line but
there are people who don't and then
there are some who in fact they start
starts very early what's the difference
it starts in childhood no I don't mean
what's the difference in Behavior I mean
I mean maybe you've thought about this
and maybe you
haven't if you have to I mean of course
you can take the two sets of people and
you can say okay this one said this and
this one said this and that's the
difference but there might be also a
difference in their value system or in
their personality or in there or in
something that explains why somebody
ends up over here and somebody over here
which matters to people who are about to
go to journalism School are about to go
to college and want to be here and not
here the question for their mothers and
they psychologists psychiatrists and so
have no Notions they vary and we know
they vary because we know all these
people and they have all kind of
different reasons uh whether it's a
six-year-old kid stealing a toy from his
brother or Anthony Lewis talking about a
romantic age when we've just carried out
a mass Slaughter or you know they vary
all kind of reasons and it's it's maybe
of interest to their family and friends
but it's of no general interest what's
of general interest is the way the
system works and it works starting very
early I mean I could give exact examples
but I'll just talk about it generally I
suppose a kid in say third grade uh
decides that what the teacher is saying
is ridiculous and he's not going to do
it I can give you some examples if you
like well what happens is he's
classified problem he becomes a behavior
problem uh if some other kid sitting
next to him says yeah of course what the
teacher saying is ridiculous I going to
do it uh he's a nice kid and he goes on
and it sort of goes on from there
there's filtering systems like this all
the way if you sit on a fa if you're if
you're on a University faculty and you
get letters of
recommendation uh for you know students
who want to apply or faculty members are
looking for a job there's some standard
terminology that you get used to a great
guy brilliant wonderful but he lacks
collegiality you know or he he's hard to
get along with or something like that
what that usually means is he's a
political radical or something like that
and uh it's under it's kind of UND
nobody will tell you I mean some people
will like you know I can name five
people will tell you but uh it's kind of
understood and it's even understandable
I mean you want your department to be
collegial you want people to be nice to
each other you don't want somebody in
the department getting up and saying
look you're a war criminal and showing
it and demonstrating it that's not nice
it doesn't feel good so you sort of keep
these people away you've had a little
experience with this yourself uh so
there's there's techniques that start
from childhood a massive filtering
system and it means that uh you know it
doesn't it's not 100% you know it's even
a totalitarian State isn't 100% this
certainly isn't but they're very
effective U filtering systems that lead
to certain
outcomes it's it's quite interesting for
people like Ed Herman or me or others
who do critical analysis of the press uh
journalists and commentators are
infuriated they say nobody tells me what
to write which is absolutely true but if
they didn't already know what to write
they wouldn't be
there so the the
the solution whether we're talking
intellectuals or
journalists um isn't in the genes of the
people and it isn't even in it it's in
the structure of the situations that
they find themselves in which over and
over and
over um produce this kind of almost
reflexive behavior um to the point where
they don't have to think about it they
don't have it's not as if they're making
a conscious Choice okay today I will lie
about barbarism in order to get an extra
two you know an extra star on my resume
they just do it because they've done it
all along and they keep doing it very
dramatic if you look at journalism is
kind of like an easy target and a little
bit unfair because a journalist has to
get something out tomorrow they can't
think about it much and so on much more
interesting is scholarship that's why
most of my own critical work is on
scholarship not on journalism because in
the case of scholarship people have time
they have resources uh they have
security they can think about what
they're doing and what you find is with
very rare exceptions pretty much same
thing like take say the study of there's
a
huge uh there's a huge study of U uh
American for foreign policy and
international relations and I just
happen to have been reading one of the
most prestigious international relations
Journal which is partially devoted to
one of the lead issues which is called
American wilsonian
idealism so one of the main thesis in
international relations Theory dealing
with the United States is the impact of
wilsonian idealism well you know it's
quite interesting I mean these articles
I happen to read are typical so I'll
pick them but runs through the whole
field uh the the people are on uh uh the
study of wilsonian idealism keeps to
almost entirely to words you know so we
ask when will said self-determination
did he mean this or did he mean that and
you have a big scholarly discussion of
it and you look at his letters and what
he worked to his wife but you don't look
at any of the facts and the facts are
glaringly obvious right now so right now
for example Haiti as everyone knows has
been hit by an incredible disaster you
know hundreds of thousands of people
killed you know billions of dollars of
damage everybody everybody wants to give
$10 to show how wonderful we are did
Wilson wilsonian idealism have anything
to do with this I have to be blind not
to see it Wilson's plenty of other
things but Wilson was one of the worst
killers in Haiti he destroyed the
country it was already half destroyed by
the French and uh he sent the Marines uh
his uh into Haiti on ridiculous pretexts
as always they killed thousands of
people according to Haitian historians
maybe 15,000 people they reinstated
virtual slavery remember Haiti was
liberated as a slave revolt uh they
uh part part you know the one of the
main things they did and this is
wilsonian idealism was Wilson sent the
Marines uh to disband Parliament Haiti
had a parliament uh it was kind of
derided in the United States so they
disbanded Parliament
at gunpoint and the reason was very
simple uh the US had written a
constitution actually Franklin Dela
Roosevelt took credit
for
probably ex you know boasting but anyway
there was a us- written Constitution uh
which the parliament refused to accept
why because the Constitution contained
what were called in the United States
Progressive measures namely permitting
us corporations to buy up Hades lands
that was explained you know by
economists and other serious thinkers
that this was very Progressive because
obviously Haiti needs foreign investment
and how can you expect Americans to
invest unless they own the place so this
is just for the benefit of Haitians that
we doing this if you read the press and
commentary it's just we're so benevolent
you know tears come from our eyes we're
trying desperately to help them and then
uh the Marine ran a referendum in which
5% of the population participated the
traditional you know collaborationist
Elite that you find in every Colony the
rich Elite they participated and there
was
99 uh 9% approval so it was a democratic
election and they got the progressive uh
uh the progressive legislation with the
obvious consequences well one of the
consequences is to add a further blow to
the agricultural system uh leading to
urbanization this goes on right into the
night I won't go through the record but
Clinton was one of the worst offenders
in this respect destroy the agricultural
system for reasons that every Economist
can explain are very
rational uh it was explained I mean
Haiti shouldn't be producing rice it's
much more efficient in the world if
highly subsidized us Agra business
should gets most of its profits from
subsidies floods Haiti with rice and
hai's rice farmers are quite efficient
which of course can't compete with it if
they go into the cities so they so women
can sew baseballs and miserable assembly
plants that's you know that's efficient
I mean any decent Economist can explain
that of course we want to be efficient
and Progressive so we drive them into
the cities we destroy the agricultural
system Along Comes a hurricane it's a
class BAS disaster like most disasters
you take a look the PE the rich people
up in the hills you know got shaken up a
little but nothing much happen huge
catastrophe among the poor people living
in urban slums why are we there why are
they there well lonian idealism had a
lot to do with it all of these things
are happening at the same moment at the
same moment that the scholarly articles
are appearing about wilsonian idealism
and uh what it is he write to his wife
in a letter and did he mean this that or
the other thing at the same moment the
front pages are showing us about this
hideous class-based disaster which
substantially results from one of many
of of Wilson's horrendous crimes and now
we get back to Orwell and double think
you have if you want to be respected
intellectual you have to have both these
ideas in your mind at the same time and
accept the believe both of them and not
notice the contradiction and this is
overwhelming all I'm I Happ to be
picking it because it's so dramatic but
you just take a look at you
know on and on I mean sometimes it's
awesome most of the time most of the
time um there's this idea of objectivity
and lots of people on the left get very
excited about that and a they critical
of it they get upset by the idea
objectivity so I'm wondering um as a
precursor to asking you about
objectivity first um broadly um you and
Ed wrote about this how does bad
journalism work and what are the Lynch
pins of it not now I'm not talking about
well answer as you will and um how would
good journalism work instead what is it
about the behavior of the New York Times
that is abhorrent to
you things like what I've described and
what is it structurally within the New
York Times which causes it in your
view first of all the New York Times is
not very much different from the elite
intellectual culture in general so my
own view is is much more striking in
scholarship and more significant but in
the New York Times U know they're kind
of obvious institutional factors the New
York Times is a major corporation huge
corporate system uh like other
businesses it sells a product to a
market the product is other businesses
advertisers that's what keeps it going
the product for the New York Times
happens to be fairly privileged
audiences you know it's the what
sometimes called the political class you
know the maybe 20% of the population
that are
managers economic political doctrinal
managers and so on so what the New York
and furthermore it's tightly linked to
other institutions of power like the
state for example which is enormously
under corporate influence in fact that's
blaring at us every day in the
newspapers so here you have a system
you're saying that they're selling that
20% that sector of the population to
companies they're selling the audience
to the advertisers that's the real
product that they're selling part of it
but they're also linked to uh state
power to other corporate power I mean
these are the that's circles in which
they live that's what you have dinner
with uh you there's a flow up and back
of people people um um same with you
know NPR and so on there a small Elite
group uh which have institutional
Roots now there are plenty of honest
journalists and you know do good work
but they do it within this
framework uh and if they sort of Drift
from the framework they're usually cut
off in fact some quit and discuss uh but
that's it's you it's kind of like the
rest of the filtering system what do you
expect to come out of a system like that
suppose you're looking at it from Mars
you see huge corporations selling
privileged people who are managers
themselves to other businesses uh linked
to other systems of power like the state
which are heavily influenced in fact
dominated by these Power Systems what
kind of product do you expect to come
out that's what you okay that's what you
see okay so then
what what about good journalism in other
words what what would you do to generate
there are concrete
examples a couple of months ago I happen
to go to Mexico I was invited for the
25th
anniversary of a newspaper which as far
as I'm aware is the only newspaper
Independent newspaper in the hemisphere
it's called laf fernada it's it's very
successful it's the second largest
newspaper in Mexico it gets no
commercial advertising because business
hates it uh it lives it has very smart
reporters and you know good people you
know really bright the kind of
intellectuals you and I would like they
write for it they do investigative
reporting it has Regional subsidiaries I
think the only Mexican Journal that
reports radly from chapas where they
have a regional office and elsewhere uh
how does it survive subscriptions I mean
they're probably a couple of wealthy
donors who give it some money but
primarily it subscribes from a very
loyal subscriber base and it's the
second largest journal in Mexico and you
know just the couple of days I was there
just reading it I learned things
important things I could tell you that
did not appear in the western press uh
okay how do they do it well that's how
they do it and they eliminate the
advertising as the source of Revenue
they'd be happy to get advertising CES I
me they'd be happy to get advertising
but you know business is highly class
conscious they're not going to subsidize
Z magaz they're they're not appealing to
it they're not they're not doing what
you need to do to attract those kinds of
ads right as far as I can you know I'm
sure there's plenty of criticisms any
objective well what does it mean the
notion of objectivity uh belongs in
graduate philosophy
seminars it doesn't apply in the real
world this is a topic for elite
intellectuals to have abstract
discussions about anybody whoever they
are has a point of view you can't help
it if you're doing quantum physics
you're looking for certain things and
you're not looking at other things maybe
what you're not looking at turns out to
be extremely important but you cannot
help having a point of view so the whole
discussion is a waste of time the whole
discussion is a waste of time good uh
there's like most discussions that take
place I mean you know there are clear
cases where you can see that the search
for what is called balance is a charade
so let's take something really important
like the survival of the species it
should be an important question uh
there's two views on the on the matter
of whether the species can have decent
survival one of them is
99.9% of scientists who say we're really
getting into trouble with the
anthropogenic warming of the atmosphere
on the other side there's uh rash limbo
Glenn Beck Sarah Palin uh congressman
himoff the editors in but you don't see
the balance that those crazies occupy
98% of the airwaves no when you see an
article in the New York Times or
anywhere else they have to balance it
and so you you get both positions and
the end result and of course you know
there a ton of advertising and
propaganda from the business world that
wants you to believe it's not happening
uh which is kind of interesting itself
because the executives who are doing
this advertising know exactly as well as
the scientists that it is happening and
they know that it's going to destroy
their grandchildren and it's going to
destroy everything that they own but
they still want people not to believe it
now there are institutional factors
there too they go back to the nature of
markets go into that you know the future
of the species is an externality you
don't consider it when you are making
trans involved in transactions so
there's good reasons for that too anyway
it's happening and we see the results I
mean right the results have been so
incredible that by now there's a sharp
decline in the United States in the
belief that in human U anthropogenic you
know human involved global warming it's
it's down now to about a third okay now
that's a death sentence for the species
I mean if that continues and you know
I'm really not exaggerating I mean we
can argue about the time span but it's
going to lead the people who are saying
it were smiled that over lunch oh yeah
because if you're if you're in a market
system take these Executives see that's
an interesting case you're the CEO of
say Exon Mobile H you're you read
everything that you know people read in
the Z magazine you know you know what's
happening you know exactly what's
happening you know that the danger is
extremely severe and that the longer we
wait the worse it's going to be but
that's what economists call an
externality it doesn't enter into your
day-by-day decisions your day-by-day
decisions in a market system are forced
you are forced to look at certain things
and not to look at others so you are
forced to look at short-term profit and
market share if you don't do that you're
out and somebody else is in and you can
actually rationalize doing it on grounds
that well if I didn't do it I'd be out
therefore I couldn't do any good for
anybody ever I don't think that's the
grounds that it's done not that I'll be
out is that I'm really doing the right
thing that's what I'm saying I'm really
doing the right thing for the world
because if I get people not to believe
in what I know is true then maybe
they'll put more money into solar energy
and incidentally maybe I'll make some
profit out of that as they're trying to
do so in the long run it's really good
for the species it's like it's not that
different from stealing a toy from your
brother yeah except that in this case
it's forced by an institution namely the
market one of what one of the Dy DCS of
uh that you mentioned is that if you're
an intellectual or a journalist there's
tremendous uh um price to pay for being
good um you're marginalized you're um
material well-being is hurt you are in
certain danger depending upon where you
are out by a us run Elite Battalion you
a lot of things can happen Okay um we
can't offset that entirely but still um
can you name some good journalists um
around the world and in the US who
deserve to be known and for another
reason which is um imagine somebody
who's off to journalism school um
they're told who the good journalists
are and of course they're the
irresponsible intellectuals etc etc and
it would do wonders if they actually
took a look at people who were a model
of what of what one should be doing so
who are some of the people who in your
view are really good journalists The
Correspondents on the ground do
extremely good work I mean if if I were
on a desert island somewhere and I was
allowed to have only one newspaper I'd
get the New York Times I mean it gives
you a tolerable picture of what's going
on in the world and the journalists who
are on the ground typically don't lie uh
they describe accurately what they see
uh same with the reading say the AP
wires the journalists on the I don't I
could give names but there are plenty of
them in fact I think it's normal it's
kind of interesting that in u the book
that Ed and Ed Herman and I wrote
manufacturing consent a large part it's
it's hated by journalists and the press
and intellectuals because they claim
it's attacking the Press it's unfair
actually a large part of the book is
defending the Press uh if you take if
anyone opens the book they'll find that
a substantial part of it is defending
the Press uh against attacks from what
are considered the Liberals Freedom
House you know the main institution that
supposed to support freedom and
democracy uh launched a huge attack on
the Press several volumes of
denunciations uh claiming that the Press
lost the war in Vietnam because they
lied about the Ted offensive they're so
pro-communist and antagonist to the
United States that they distorted what
happened and therefore we lost this
Noble War that's freedom
well you know Ed and I went through the
two volumes uh we found that the number
of outright lies was straight lies was
just phenomenal when we actually looked
at the facts what we found is the
reporters on the ground were reporting
what happened honestly courageously and
accurately but within a
framework that is
just destroyed by IDE iCal fanaticism so
somebody would write an article saying
you know
the the Air Force came and they bombed
this place to smithin and the soldiers
came in they killed everybody who was
around and uh you know it's just
necessary to defend freedom and
democracy in South
Vietnam uh yeah so the reporters were
honest professional accurate but deeply
ideological in contrast Freedom House
was just lying through the peace in that
case presumably for you the model of a
good reporter good journalist good
commentator is not only somebody who um
relays facts that they see but is not
subject to the to the U that frame from
this very period uh this
is roughly the period now within a year
or two of when the mili Massacre took
actually it's actually the period when
the Meli Massacre took place 1968 which
is what're talking about uh the mili
Massacre which was finally broke through
thanks to saiers Independent journalist
working for Dispatch news service was a
very smart guy he picked the moment of a
huge demonstration in Washington you
know million people a lot of journalists
around so he picked that moment to
release publicly the information on mili
that had been around for a year and a
half nobody paid any attention to so it
became a big thing and that kind of the
symbol of everything that went wrong
it's a wonderful symbol for Liberal
intellectuals because you can blame it
on half
educated half crazed GIS in the field
who didn't know who was going to shoot
at him next there there was a a couple
of journalists mainly Kevin Buckley who
was a Saigon correspondent of Newsweek
uh he and an associate uh Alan shimin I
think his name was did a detailed
analysis of what was of of the context
of mili this was part of a series of
what we called postte pacification
campaigns huge mass murder operations uh
to which mili was a minuscule footnote
and was such a small footnote that the
there's a Quaker Hospital which is Quang
na right near where it took place I mean
they knew about it at once they didn't
even bother mentioning it because it
happening all over the place uh well
Buckley U wrote this all up Newsweek
wouldn't publish it he gave it to me uh
Ed and Ed Herman and I wrote about it in
political economy of Human Rights South
End Book in 79 and what we pointed out
was that U yeah it took place and it's
easy to focus on it because you can
blame it on bad guys not like us uh but
what was actually taking place in the
air conditioned rooms where people just
like us were sitting was incomparably
more horrendous you think anybody ever
mentioned that well actually one person
did uh 30 years later so it's marginally
noticed but you know what Kevin Buckley
did and his associate was really good
journalism
Ani s was aniet because he could attack
the crimes of Kremlin was he against the
Russian people was he against the
Russian
culture soci you know saying Russian
people are awful it's Russian
nationalist
Russian but they were anti-russian
because they were condemning the crimes
of the state andaran states do identify
themselves the nature
