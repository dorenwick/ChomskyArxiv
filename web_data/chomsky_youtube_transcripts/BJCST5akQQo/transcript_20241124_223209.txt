welcome to activism Mich Professor Nam
chsky thank you for joining us again
pleas to be with you so I want to start
with you um with some historical
perspective and let's work our way up
from there before the second world war
um what view did the United States
government have of fascism in Germany
what was the political and Military
relationship between Berlin and
Washington well it was a mixed story U
uh Roosevelt himself
was had a mixed attitude so so he for
example he was pretty supportive of
melini's fascism in fact describe
musolini as that admirable Italian
gentleman uh he later concluded
that musolini had been misled by his
association with Hitler and had been LED
kind of down a wrong path but America
the American Business Community the
Power Systems in the United States were
highly supportive of mellini in fact
even the parts of the the labor
bureaucracy were
uh Fortune Magazine example the major
Business Journal I think in
1932 had an issue with a headline I'm
quoting it the wops are un whopping
themselves The is a kind of a a
derogatory term for Italians and the
wops are finally un whopping themselves
under musolini they're becoming part of
the Civilized world it's uh uh and there
was criticism of the u u Italian
invasion of Ethiopia a lot of criticism
but basically pretty supportive attitude
towards muslin fascism when Germany when
Hitler took over the attitude was more
mixed there was a concern for Potential
Threat but nevertheless uh the general
approach of the US the British even more
so was fairly supportive so for example
in
1937 the state department described
Hitler as u a kind of a moderate U
fending off the dangerous forces of the
right
sorry excuse me there was a technical
problem just continue I should continue
yes please the state department uh uh
described Hitler as a moderate who was
holding off the forces the dangerous
forces of the left meaning the
Bolsheviks the labor movement and so on
and of the right namely the extremist
Nazis and Hitler was kind of in the
middle and therefore we should kind of
support him this is a pretty familiar
stance incidentally and many other cases
uh George Kon later famous as one of the
architect of postwar policy it was
actually the American Cil in Berlin uh
up until Pearl Harbor and he was sending
back
reports uh which are public which were
qualified they said we shouldn't be too
harsh in condemning the Nazis there a
lot of what they're doing is kind of
understandable they you know we could
get along with them and so on this is
one strain and a major one there was
also plenty of criticism and
condemnation but the general attitudes
were fairly mixed this is sometimes
called when
uh at the Munich conference late
38 U Roosevelt sent his most trusted
advisor SAR Wells to Munich and Wells
came back with a pretty positive report
saying we can really work with Hitler
it's uh this conference opens the
possibility of a period of peace and
justice for Europe and we should work
out ways to interact and deal with them
that was late
1938
okay and um so it was quite a mixed
story actually this good there's good
scholarly literature on this if you want
to go through the details
