[Applause]
uh I was asked to talk about
particularly the uh ending of the latest
phase of the peace process and the U
Unity government the PE pales the
PA Hamas Unity government and the two
are related the peace process so-called
was terminated by Israel because the
unity government was
established uh there's been some
discussion of this but U the only really
accurate account of it that I've seen
which I'll just quote is by a very
distinguished lanese political analyst
Ramy hurri he points out I'll quote him
that the national Unity agreement
between fat and Hamas precisely
mentioned that Hamas had agreed to these
three demands recognition of Israel
nonviolence and adherence to previous
agreements the the conditions that the
quartet that's the US EU Russia and the
United Nations mainly the US that the
quartet set on 30th of January 2006
important date which I'll come back to
uh Israel told president abas that he
had to choose between peace with Israel
and a pact with Hamas the American
government predictably described
Palestinian Unity as
unhelpful uh so when the Israelis and
the Americans suddenly came face to face
with the United Palestinian leadership
that openly and explicitly accepted the
Israeli American terms for diplomatic
engagement the Israelis and Americans
ignored their own terms for talks and
totally shattered the most recent
attempt to negotiate peace this kind of
Reckless hypocrisy or straightforward
lying is bad enough in itself but it's
made even worse by the fact that on the
Israeli side there are ministers in the
Netanyahu government
who reject the quartet's three
conditions they reject palestine's right
to exist they reject previous agreements
most notably the Oslo Accords and they
reserve the rights right to use violence
against Palestinians and other Arabs and
create their envisioned greater Israel
from the Mediterranean to the Jordan
River that's accurate as far as it goes
but it doesn't go quite far enough uh
there are two other
preconditions that the Palestinians are
required to accept for the so-called
peace process one precondition is that
it be run by the United States that
instantly tells you it's not going to
get anywhere the US is a participant not
a neutral party it's as if uh someone
were to suggest that the Sunni
Shia conflicts in the Iraq be negotiated
by Iran we'd all left and this is
exactly the same even worse because the
US is uh directly a part just as hurry
says it's partner of Israel if there
were to be a serious peace process it
would be negotiated by some party that
has a degree of credibility in the
international Arena maybe Brazil or
somebody like that certainly not the
United States states which not only is a
partner here but is regarded by the
world as the greatest threat to World
Peace you don't know that if you're a
reader of the American Press because the
American Press doesn't report things
like that but there was a major
International poll last December run by
Gallup in the United States it's British
counterpart and one of the questions was
which country is the greatest threat the
world peace the United States was was so
far out in front that no one else was
even close a second way behind was
Pakistan and that was inflated by the
Indian vote nobody else is considered a
major threat to World Peace but that's
not the kind of thing it's nice for
Americans to know so the Press uniformly
suppressed it with a single exception a
Murdoch tabloid New York Post Ultra
right tabloid did mention it and uh
cited it as example of how crazy the
world is how can anybody think that
about us you know the greatest
proponents of Peace well that's it so
the one condition is the negotiations
have to be run by the country that is
the greatest threat to world peace and
there is a partner of Israel in the
interactions of course it's not likely
to get anywhere the other precondition
is that settlement expansion must be
allowed to continue the Palestinians
must accept that as a precondition for
uh entering into negotiations now of
course the United States says well we
don't like it but they do it with a wink
that says fine go ahead we'll pay for it
we'll give you the Diplomatic support
for it and although that we say we don't
like it we in fact thinks it's fine and
that was in fact
demonstrated uh with great clarity uh in
the most recent US Security Council veto
there are many of them the most recent
was February
2011 Obama which did receive a little
attention usually these are never
mentioned but uh uh this did was
mentioned because it was kind of extreme
Obama vetoed a security Council
resolution calling for the
implementation of official US policy so
that did receive a couple of words the
resolution called for an end to
settlement
expansion us VTO it uh Israelis have no
problem determining what that means just
as they have no problem understanding
what it means when the US continues to
provide the uh military economic
diplomatic even ideological support for
the settlement expansion uh notice
incidentally the settlement expansion is
a very minor issue though that's the
only one anyone talks about the issue is
the settlements uh I don't know what
happened to the map that was up there
but
uh they
can well you can imagine
it oh there it is
uh the settlements are uh basically
green they uh White sorry it's the huge
area around Jerusalem which goes
essentially bisects the West Bank it
goes to uh uh practically to Jericho
including the town of maim which was
built mostly during the Clinton years in
order to ensure that there would be no
meaningful political settlement it
essentially bisects the West Bank the
white part is um partly uh settled by
Israel along the Jordan Valley where
they're kicking out Palestinians rapidly
and partly is kind of un uninhabitable
so it gives you misleading impression
the green part I'm sorry the white part
is being settled by Israel there's
another uh Corridor up to the north goes
first part goes to the town of Ariel uh
built in order to B break up what's left
of the West Bank and above it the one to
the north goes to a town of kadum also
intended to cantonize whatever may be
left to the Palestinians all of this is
illegal it's not controversial uh the
highest International authorities have
been very explicit on this Security
Council of the United Nations uh in a
unanimous vote there was one exstension
United States but in otherwise unanimous
vote uh voted declared all of these uh
settlements illegal the international
court of
justice made same ruling uh in the area
around the white area around Jerusalem
which is real C Jerusalem is a vastly
expanded region which Israel has in fact
annexed in violation of explicit
Security Council orders which even the
United States voted for there's more but
we'll keep that that's the problem the
settlement settlement expansion which is
what's talked about as an additional uh
reason why an additional barrier to any
potential peace process well that's uh
but those are the two pre the pre pre
preconditions that Israel that
Palestinians have to accept first accept
negotiations run by the United States
Israel's partner the greatest threat the
world peace secondly accept expansion of
settlements not just settlements all
illegal and thirdly the three conditions
that I mentioned recognition of Israel
nonviolence and adherence to previous
agreements which the Israeli government
doesn't accept and the United States of
of course doesn't accept uh but the
Palestinians must and when they did
accept them negotiations were were
stopped because of Israel announced that
it won't deal with a Unity government
well uh why what's the problem about a
Unity government uh I meant quoted hurry
that uh these conditions were
established on the 30th of January
2006 uh what happened then well shortly
before that what took place was a very
important event the one and only free
election in the Arab world carefully
monitored judged to be free and fair uh
it only had one problem the wrong people
won the election so therefore the US in
line with its famous love for democracy
immediately imposed a harsh punishment
on the Palestinians for voting the wrong
way harsh sanctions uh Israel of course
imposed harsher sanctions and also
escalated its direct attack it's
constantly attacking Gaza
particularly off there on the left and
uh the West Bank all the time and it
sharply escalated them that was the US
Israeli response to the one free
election now this
was hury also mentions the Oslo
agreements the Oslo agreements one
element of them was that the West Bank
and Gaza are a territorial Unity which
cannot be
divided uh as soon as the Oslo
agreements were signed in
1994 the United States and Israel
instantly moved to separate the West
Bank from Gaza they had actually started
it before but extended it right away in
violation of the agreement uh for a good
reason uh if Gaza and the West Bank are
separated in violation of international
agreements that the US solemnly
signed well uh you you don't need the
map to see it but if you think about it
uh if Gaza and the West Bank are
separated the West Bank is completely
imprisoned whatever autonomy might be
granted to Palestinians in some of those
cantons in the West Bank will have no
access to the outside world it's
surrounded by Israel uh in fact when it
as Israel s settles the Jordan Valley
which was over to the right uh
completely imprisoned by Israel Israeli
us Ali Jordan right next to it uh no
further access to the outside world Gaza
is the one access to the outside world
so it's therefore quite crucial for the
US and Israel to make sure that the Oslo
Agreements are not yeah you can see it
there are not enacted so that they'll
never be whatever crumbs might be given
to Palestinians will be even more
meaningless than they might be otherwise
that's very critical uh more should be
said about this the US Israeli rejection
of the agreements that they had demanded
soon as the Palestinians accepted them
that's traditional goes far back uh if
if we weren't if history were not
self-suppression here we'd all know
about this so just mention a couple of
cases uh in
1971 uh the government of Egypt
president Sadat offered Israel a full
peace treaty full peace treaty
normalization of relations everything in
in return for Israel's uh withdrawal
from the Israeli occupied Sinai egyp
si uh the Israeli that would have been
Israel had to make a decision at that
point they made the most fiful decision
in their history I think a peace treaty
with Israel would ensure essentially
complete Security it's the only military
force in the Arab world that means
anything and right next door of course
but so the choice was should they accept
security or insist on
expansion at that time it was a labor
government the so called moderates the
doves uh they had plans which they were
just about to implement already
implementing for extensive settlement in
the Egyptian sin they were planning to
build a big city million people on the
Mediterranean the city of yamit many set
settlements kibuts other settlements in
the Sinai they were driving out
thousands of bwin who lived there bin
aren't just people who wander around
they had towns Villages you know mosques
cemeteries all destroyed people driven
into the desert and that was the choice
shall we expand into the Sinai Egyptian
Sinai or accept security they considered
it and uh the cabinet golden mayor
cabinet rejected the agreement was
another proposal from Jordan the
following year full peace treaty and
return evacuation of the Jordanian
territory West Bank that wasn't I don't
think that one even got a response uh
the question as always is what's the US
going to do uh well there was actually a
bureaucratic battle inside the United
States government uh the state
department was in favor of accepting the
Egyptian offer which was very much in
line with official US policy Henry
Kissinger who was National Security
adviser uh was opposed he was he wanted
what he described that what he called
stalemate he insisted on stalemate
stalemate means no negotiations just
force no diplomacy just force and it was
assumed at the time pretty broadly that
Israel had a virtual monopoly of force
so it was safe to say well let's forget
negotiations just follow support
Israel's Israel's policy of forceful
expansion that's what happened a Sadat
made every effort to try to convince the
United States uh to accept political
settlement they he was essentially
disregarded mocked uh to everyone's
surprise he did launch a war in October
1973 to
um to recover actually to to try to get
the Diplomatic process going and the war
turned prised everyone turned out to be
a very close call for Israel in fact for
the world Kissinger at one point
declared a nuclear alert the reason for
that we've learned from Recently
Declassified documents is that uh the
United States and Russia had imposed
jointly imposed a
ceasefire but Kissinger had privately
informed Israel that they could violate
it if they wanted and in order to make
sure that the Russian didn't react
kinger called a nuclear alert well
fortunately as always the Russians
backed down so we're here to talk about
it but it was a serious issue and uh
after that Kissinger recognized you
can't treat Egypt as a basket case you
start what's called subtle shuttle
diplomacy ended up with the Camp David
agreements 1978
79 in which Israel and the United States
essentially accepted Sadat's 1971 offer
that's however in a much harsher form
for the US Israeli point of view course
By
1979 Palestinian nationalism had entered
the international agenda and the US and
Israel were forced to make some kind of
a commitment to Palestinian national
rights unlike
71 uh in the United States that's
regarded as a diplomatic Triumph
President Carter's great achievement
take a look at it it was a diplomatic
catastrophe uh the US and Israel finally
accepted a version of a 71 offer which
was harsher from their point of view and
did it after a major war with thousands
of people killed a threat of a lot of
suffering threat of nuclear war but they
finally accepted it well uh what did
Israel do as I mentioned Palestinian
nationalism entered the International
agenda in the mid-70s in January 76 an
event took place which is wiped out of
History here like such events generally
uh what happened is that uh the three
major Arab states uh Egypt Syria and
Jordan brought a resolution to the
security Council calling for a two-state
settlement on the internationally
recognized border that's the border that
goes around around the edge there uh
two- State settlement and then they use
the standard diplomatic language uh with
a guarantee of the for the right of each
state in the region Israel and Palestine
to exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized
borders by now that's a virtually
Universal uh International consensus
it's accepted by the Arab states and pal
iians organization of Islamic States
includes Iran Europe Latin America
essentially everyone with the usual two
exceptions United States and Israel
don't accept it uh but that was January
1976 uh what happened is that the United
States vetoed the
resolution when the US vetos the
security Council resolution it's
essentially a double veto first of all
it's not implemented but secondly it's
vetoed from history so you might try a
research project and see if you can find
it discussed anywhere actually you can
if you look at I've written about it a
couple of other people have you can find
it in the New York Times January 22nd or
so
1976 but it's essentially out of History
the US V to a similar resolution in
1980 uh that's under Carter that's out
of History uh long record in the general
assembly annual votes more or less uh
know 160 to2 or something like that us
and Israel they're never reported uh one
of Theos was reported the one I
mentioned February 2011 when the United
States Obama vetoed his own policy which
did get mentioned that's the Diplomatic
record uh and Israel had an interesting
reaction to the January 76 offer
remember that it offered to uh the offer
was to that each state uh including
Israel would have the right to exist in
peace and security within secure and
recognized boundaries so therefore it
was necessary to raise the barriers to
block negotiations at that point this
concept of right to exist entered Israel
insisted and the us back them that the
pal Palestinians must not only accept
their right to exist within secure and
recognized borders but their abstract
right to exist no state has a right to
exist states are Power Systems
established by violence they're
recognized but their right to exist is
not recognized so for example Mexico
does not it recognizes the United States
it does not accept the right of the
United States to exist sitting on half
of Mexico conquered in a war of
aggression violent War and the same with
other states in the world but Israel
uniquely has to have a right to exist
which means the Palestinians have to
accept the legit not only the fact of
their dispossession but its
legitimacy that's a way to raise the
barriers to ensure that the threat of
peaceful political settlement won't be
pursued uh that happened again just a
couple of years ago when the current
government of Israel added a new demand
uh the Palestinians must accept Israel's
right to exist as a Jewish
State no state in the world is
recognized as an ethnic State as the
state of some part of its population so
for example Pakistan is recognized but
it's not recognized as an Islamic State
though it calls itself the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan the countries can
call themselves what they like but
nobody else in the International System
recognizes them as racist states which
is what it means to be an Islamic State
or Christian state or Jewish state or
white state or whatever so this is a
unique demand again imposed so as to
impose uh to raise a further barrier to
negotiations and what's happening
currently is that when the Palestinians
accepted all the conditions uh the US
and Israel ended the negotiations no
other no further way to raise a barrier
apparently though maybe somebody will
think of one well that's the that's a
encapsulated history a lot more of
course a lot what's more is worth
mentioning so mention a couple of things
in in
1988 the Palestinian National Council
that's the highest governing body
uh formally recognized the two-state
consensus of the International Community
formally agreed to it uh Israel reacted
to that they reacted At Once by
announcing quote it that U there cannot
be an additional Palestinian State
between Jordan and Israel in other words
Jordan is a Palestinian State the
jordanians don't think so Palestinians
don't think so but what do they know we
say that Jordan is a Palestinian State
and they cannot be an additional one
furthermore the uh fate of the occupied
territories the West Bank and Gaza will
be settled according to the guidelines
of the government of Israel that was the
US Israeli response to the uh
Palestinian acceptance formal acceptance
and tacitly accept CED before of the
international consensus as always
question is what's the US going to do
shortly after that a couple months later
uh came What's called the baker plan
James Baker you read the baker Clan
carefully it doesn't explicitly endorse
the Israeli position that would be a
little too blatant but what it says is
negotiations can take place and
Palestinians will be permitted to
participate in negot iations if they
accept the Israeli position okay so it
actually goes beyond the Israeli
rejectionism says we of course accept it
and Palestinians can negotiate if they
accept it too okay that's 1988 and so it
continues uh no the Oslo agreements were
established in 1994 but uh uh it was
instantly obvious that uh they
were what had actually happened was that
after the first Gulf War in 1991
1991 uh the US was in a position of just
overwhelming power and President Bush
did uh organize negotiations called the
Madrid
negotiations with the selected
Palestinians permitted to participate
they didn't get anywhere the reason they
didn't get anywhere is that the
Palestinian negotiating team was led by
hyra Abdul shafia probably the most
respected person in the West in the
Palestinian territories a a serious
dedicated Nationalist and he bed at one
condition he insisted he wouldn't sign
anything that permitted settlement
expansion remember the problem is the
settlements not the expansion but Al
shafi's condition he refused to sign if
it was going to allow further expansion
which of course Israel's planning and
the US so they broke down at that point
an in run took place around the
Palestinians by yaser Arafat he was in
Tunis the outside Palestinians trying to
get back into the ACT they made a deal
with Israel through Norway those are the
Oslo Accords the oso Accords made no
condition about settlement expansion in
fact the Oslo Accords offered nothing to
the
Palestinians you should read them it's
easy you can look it up on the internet
there was a declaration of principles
you two or three pages you can find it
if you look at it what it says is that
the final result of negotiations the
final settlement will adhere to United
Nations resolution
242 anyone familiar with the Diplomatic
history knows what that means you can
look up un 242 it offers nothing to the
Palestinians the only mention of
Palestinians is vague rights of refugees
so the final outcome of the Oslo Accords
is to be a settlement in which nothing
is offered to the Palestinians literally
and it proceeded exactly that way in the
following years as I said the US and
Israel immediately separated Gaza from
the West Bank in violation of the
agreement ments uh the government of
Israel the this is the doish government
the yak Rin Shimon Paris rapidly
expanded settlements Clinton of course
supported it settlement expansion
continued in a straight line right
through the
1990s uh goes on from there I could go
on through the rest but that's
essentially the story uh can there be a
political let's go go back to what's
just happened
when the negotiations break broke down
John kery made a statement which quickly
went viral he said that uh unless Israel
accepts a two-state settlement they'll
become they might become an AP part
height State uh that blew up you saw the
reaction hysterical reaction in the
United States and in Israel he'd used
the a word you're not allowed to use
that word uh of course he wasn't saying
that Israel was an apartheid state he
said that if it unless it accepted a
two-state settlement it would become an
aparte State actually that's universally
accepted by Israelis as well there what
the St what he was assuming is that
there are two options and this is
standard not just carry virtually
everyone Israelis Palestinian solidarity
groups constantly present the situation
as if there are two two options either
the international consensus on a
two-state settlement or else Israel
takes over the whole region and then uh
there'll be a civil rights struggle an
anti- aparte struggle there'll be one
state from Jordan to the sea with pretty
soon a majority of Palestinians and you
really have an anti-apartheid struggle
and in fact the Israeli Israeli
commentators who call for some kind of
two State settlement do so because if
that happened uh Israel could no longer
be what's called a Jewish and Democratic
State whatever that's supposed to mean
but whatever it's supposed to mean it
wouldn't be possible with a majority of
Palestinians so the doves say look we
can't accept this that's car's comment
uh and two things talk to discuss about
it one is the a word I'll come back to
that and the other is the uh uh the
question of what are the options and
that's quite crucial on all sides the
analysis is simply incorrect those are
not the two options the two options are
either a two-state settlement or Israel
continues to do exactly what it's doing
with continued us support and we know
exactly what it's doing that map more or
less indicates
it vastly expanding Jerusalem way into
the West Bank has nothing to do with
traditional Jerusalem uh annexed in
violation of Security Council orders
carer off to the east to the town of
maim essentially bisecting the West Bank
and two cars up north breaking up what's
left settling the Jordan Valley which
imprisons the cantons that are left uh
the region that is being developed and
Taking Over by Israel will have very few
Palestinians first of all it doesn't
have many Palestinians to begin with
because the Israeli expansion programs
are careful to avoid the heavy
Palestinian population concentrations
like Nablus and tulkarm they don't want
them they don't want the Palestinians so
there won't be and the Palestinians who
are there are being systematically
expelled you can follow it day by day
Israeli Army comes in to a village
announces uh this is a military zone you
have 24 hours to get out uh people can
pick up whatever pieces of furniture
they can manage and get out and find a
way to live somewhere and then the
region the areas uh the village is
demolished and the military zone soon
turns into another Israeli settlement
that's the standard technique constant
actually it's been going on for hundred
years in one form or another but uh now
it's official state policy that's the
alternative uh the end result of that if
as this region is gradually integrated
into Israel we'll be a greater Israel
that actually has fewer has a lower
proportion of non-jews than Israel does
today lower proportion because many
hundreds of thousands of Israelis will
be integrated and very few pal iians
that's the alternative to a two-state
settlement there is just no possibility
realistic possibility of Israel taking
over the whole region of a one state
settlement that's Chimera you can forget
about it and maybe it could happen in
the long run after a long process which
one could discuss but it's not an option
for the foreseeable future that's one
point the second Point what about the a
word uh that's used pretty commonly and
it's quite
misleading within Israel itself there is
severe discrimination but it's not a
part heite in fact it's not all that
different from what exists here and many
other countries a little harsher but not
fundamentally different but it's not a
part height bad but not a part height in
the occupied territories the situation
is much worse than aparte much worse you
have to recall that
in South Africa the white
nationalist uh
Community depended upon the black
population that was 85% of the
population was their Workforce they
couldn't live without them uh they had
to U it was kind of like the slave
population in the South you needed them
you can't get rid of them and maintain
the same economy and you know system of
wealth and power and so on and in fact
the AP part height government uh lent
some support to the uh black population
just similar to the way uh slave owners
uh kept their slaves alive uh if you
have a capital investment uh you try to
maintain it you so you own a car you try
to keep it up going uh that the black
population was their Workforce so there
was some there were some developments
for the black population they tried to
sustain them and remember that they were
trying to get International recognition
for the banters so they wanted to try to
make them more or less respectable they
didn't get any recognition but they
tried the situation the occupied
territories is totally different Israel
does not want the Palestinians Israel's
attitude toward the Palestinians is like
uh the US attitude toward the indigenous
population here that they should be
exterminated that's what settler
Colonial societies are like societies
like U the United States Australia New
Zealand Canada Israel these are special
kinds of Imperial societies where you
don't try to integrate the domestic
population you try to get rid of them uh
was explicit in the US case like George
Washington uh who was called by the iroy
the town Destroyer which is because
that's what he was doing uh his view was
that the iray nation has to be
extrap uh Thomas Jefferson said that
unfortunately we're going to have to
exterminate the native population
because they they attack us you know
they refuse to just fade away uh and
that's the whole history of the
settlement of the national territory
that's why you don't find Native
Americans around Canada didn't get quite
that far they left them off in the
fringes
uh
Australia Aboriginal groups are around
somewhere but very marginalized and
suppressed and that's essentially the uh
character of settler Colonial societies
Israel is one uh so they don't want the
Palestinians they want them out or
marginalized or canonized but the so the
situation the circumstances that are
being constructed are far worse than a
parite so the a word isn't really
appropriate in either case uh there is
uh one respect there it's common to draw
comparisons between Israel and South
Africa you read that all the time and if
you read the history of South Africa
which is worth doing uh you find that
there really are some parallels but not
the ones that are discussed aparte is
not a good
analogy the analogy that's accurate is
the way a part height developed and
collapsed and the story is roughly like
this uh in we know from Declassified
documents in
1958 the Nationalist government which
had just instituted the aparte regime
forly uh the uh the the the uh foreign
minister of South Africa called in the
American
ambassador U we have the colloquy he
told him essentially look uh we know
that we're becoming a pariah State uh
everyone's turning against us they don't
understand the legitimacy and virtue of
what we're doing we're constantly voted
down in the United Nations we're going
to be isolated but it really doesn't
matter because you and I know that
there's only one vote in the United
Nations that's yours and as long as you
support us long as us supports them they
can go ahead doing whatever they like
that's basically what was recognized in
1958 and that's pretty much what
happened uh throughout the following
years opposition to a part developed
substantially it became a enormous
International movement that reached the
United States by the
1980s uh with the corporations pulling
out the Congress passing sanctions
against South Africa which Reagan vetoed
and Congress passed over his veto and he
then violated them in increasing support
for South Africa Reagan was the last
supporter of the aparte regime in the
International System last major one he
was Reagan refused to believe that there
was a race issue in South Africa his
view is that there're just a lot of
tribes you know the Zulu and the whites
and others and they're having some
tribal difficulties but but uh they got
to sort it out that way uh the rest of
the world had already turned strongly
against uh aparte fer kind of supported
Reagan but not as strongly but Reagan
held on to the end uh in fact uh as you
may know Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress was condemned by the
Reagan Administration in
1988 right near the end of the aparte
regime was condemned as one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
and Mandela was in fact on the US
terrorist list until just a couple of
years ago when he came to the United
States he had to have special
dispensation finally a special
legislative Act was passed to remove him
from the terrorist list that was the US
attitude toward South Africa and it's it
remained the apart heits system was
maintaining
itself uh in around 199
the US policy
shifted and the U for couple of good
reasons it began moveed towards
accepting a kind of a compromise that
the white nationalists and thec were
reaching and at that point the aparte
system
collapsed well that's uh there are other
examples like that another example is uh
Indonesia's invasion of East timour
Indonesia 1975 5 invaded East Tour
Portuguese Colony former Portuguese
Colony carried out a really genocidal
attack uh probably a quarter of the
population was murdered all with us
support strong us support went on for 25
years uh other Western countries also
supported it in uh 1999 September
1999 under quite severe International
pressure and domestic pressure as well
in the United States uh President
Clinton informed the Indonesian Army
that the game was over one phrase
actually said it's the end they pulled
out the next day uh us power is very
strong uh should say however that there
were other factors in the South African
case crucial ones uh one was that there
was a compromise that could be reached
nothing analogous in Israel Palestine
the compromise and the one that was
reached was that the socioeconomic
system would remain
unchanged but there would be Black Faces
in The
Limousines so some blacks would be
allowed to enter the elite in the formal
apar heite but basically the system of
power would remain unchanged with some
blacks in positions you know super
wealthy and so on and that's pretty much
what happened that satisfied South
African business international business
uh thec accepted it the state Authority
International States accepted it and
there's no analogy in the case of Israel
Palestine the other difference is a
critical one and one that you're not
allowed to know about in the United
States so I speak about it in a hushed
voice prend you didn't hear it the other
reason was a country called cu Cuba Cuba
played an enormous role in The
Liberation of South Africa all of Africa
in fact uh South African South Africa
was in had invaded the surrounding
countries Angola was holding namibian
violation of un orders trying to create
a kind of a region that would be
dominated by white South Africa Cuba
sent first of all tens of thousands of
technical workers doctors
development uh AIDS and so on to
maintain the countries but also sent
troops it sent military troops to Angola
which drove out the South African
Invaders the US was Furious that's part
of the reason for the US hostility to
Cuba many reasons but that's one they
drove out the South African Invaders uh
they forced South Africa to abandon
Namibia and crucially these were black
soldiers and that was very significant
uh it broke the kind of myth of the uh
superhuman white uh you know
the I don't know what they you called
them the the Invincible white uh white
men showed black soldiers could defeat
them and drive them out of Angola that
had a big psychological effect all over
Africa uh both on the black and the
white Community the white Community
recognized they're not going to be able
to establish their region of power and
they did finally move to accept the part
heite well there's no parallel to that
in the Israel Palestine case it's
uh it's left actually in the hands of
people like you uh the only thing that
can create a breakthrough in Israel
Palestine is for the United States to
change its policy I don't think there's
any other realistic option at least in
the short run and that's by no means
impossible these policies are not Graven
in stone They do change gave a couple of
examples there are others and in fact uh
in fact as this meeting itself
illustrates uh sentiment is changing in
the United States
significantly uh not many years ago if I
tried to give a talk like this at MIT
I'd have to have police protection
literally and the police would insist on
accompanying me back to my car because
it was too dangerous and meetings were
broken up you know tons of hostile
questions you know screaming and so on
that's changed
enormously by now Palestinian solidarity
is one of the maybe the one of the
leading issues on
campus large groups of young people are
involved engaged there uh efforts at
boycotts sanctions and so on all
a radical change and this can extend
into uh uh compelling a change in policy
it's not going to be easy it's not going
to happen by itself there's plenty of
forces that uh insist upon maintaining
the tight relationship with Israel which
is very valuable to American Elites and
Industry and Military industry others in
many respects but it it's not it's not
not Graven and stone it can change and I
just can't think of any other way in
which there could be a a break in this
system thank you uh John hasbun from
Bethlehem West Bank
um so it's it could be optimistic but
what is the national interest from the
United States some argue
that some argue that it's a strategic
geopolitical what is the national
interest that if that that that needs to
change in order for the national policy
to change for the US well before
comenting let me ask a prior question
what does the phrase National interest
mean I mean the phrase National interest
is used standardly in the academic world
you know international relations Theory
claims that states pursue the national
interest uh that's the leading principle
of all discussion what is it I mean does
the CEO of General Electric have the
same interest as the janitor who cleans
his
floors well they have totally different
interests now there's all kinds of
interests What's called the national
interest turns out to be the interest of
dominant domestic forces in US
Society so the national interest means
the interests of the very rich major
corporations the ones who set government
policy and so on that's the national
interest and not the population the
population is basically irrelevant the
population often strongly opposes
government policy and they're simply
disregarded not just on this case many
others I say take Cuba for uh 50 years
the United States has been waging a war
against Cuba major terrorist War not
trivial it's not these jokes about uh
Castro's beard that the Press talks
about major terrorist attacks thousands
of people killed and so on an embargo
crushing embargo that the whole world
opposes how does the US population feel
about it well there have been polls
since the
1970s large majority of the population
thinks we should normalize relations
with Cuba does anybody pay attention to
them doesn't make any difference uh in
fact the gap between
public opinion and policy is enormous on
issue after issue I mean take say
domestic issues uh for again about 40
years they're regular polls uh asking
people what they think about the tax
system overwhelmingly people say there
should be much higher taxes on the
wealthy what happens taxes on the
wealthy go down you know uh and it's the
same on issue after issue we do not live
in a society in which the public
determines policy The public's around
you know but basically disregarded
unless they force themselves to into the
system by serious activism and I think
that's true of national interest so
let's take National interest in its real
sense the interest of those who are in a
position of power in American society to
be able to make decisions what's their
interest well lots of Interest
some are straight strategic you go back
to
1948 The Joint Chiefs of Staff were very
impressed with uh Israel's military
performance during the 48 war and
recognized as they put it that Israel
could become a valuable base for
American power is said it's the major
military force in the region outside of
turkey and it would be a perfect uh Ally
and base for us power
uh the u oil dictatorships Saudi Arabia
primarily they made it very clear that
they didn't mind there was not going to
be any threat to us oil interests in
fact they had their own Saudi Arabian
Saudi Arabia is a family basically you
know royal family they made it quite
clear that uh that even though they had
to publicly condemn Israel they didn't
really mean it they actually thought it
was fine if Israel was there Israel
their concern remember at the time was
Britain the main concern of the in the
Arab world was Britain it and the Jordan
which was a was trans Jordan at the time
which was a British colony and the
hashimite uh Rule and the Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia just driven the hashimites
out of the U the holy territories Mecca
and Medina they thought they might be
coming back they didn't want that they
wanted a deterrent to Jordan trans
Jordan especially because the British
were trying to set up a hashimite system
which would govern both trans Jordan and
Iraq which is regarded as a threat
serious threat by Saudi Arabia and what
are now the Emirates and Israel was a
kind of a deterrent so they didn't
really mind and in fact that continues
Saudi Arabia and Israel have fairly
common policies right now furthermore in
1967 crucial year that's when US the US
Israel relationship was actually
established in its current form before
that it was kind of friendly but nothing
unique became unique after'
67 something happened in '
67 uh Israel provided a great gift to
Saudi Arabia and the United States there
was a conflict there has been a
long-standing conflict between radical
Islam and secular
nationalism and the United States like
British Britain before it had has pretty
consistently supported radical Islam
still continues to the center of radical
Islam is Saudi Arabia the most extremist
uh radical islamist state in the world
and also a missionary State they try to
uh expand their wahhabist salafi
doctrines all over the place uh and
they're the strongest Ally of the United
States Britain had similar policies uh
in 1967 there was a war going on between
Saudi Arabia and Egypt Egypt was the
center of secular
nationalism uh Israel invaded Egypt and
pretty much destroyed its U its basis
its base in the Arab world also Syria
serious blow against secular nationalism
great victory for radical Islam big
victory for the United States which
regarded nasser's Egypt as the main
threat that's when the special
relationship ship was established and it
continued like that first time I go
on it remains a major strategic base in
fact if you want to know how serious it
is one of the most interesting of the
Wikileaks was a list of
uh re regions of the world that the unit
that the Pentagon regards as super
important have to be protected you know
no matter what one of them is right
outside
Kaa rapael military Industries it's a
high-tech military industry right
outside Kaa one of the places where most
of the Drone technology was developed is
so closely linked to us industry and to
the Pentagon that they actually shifted
their management headquarters to
Washington where the money is uh but
it's it's just essentially part of US
military industry and that's just the
beginning uh it's a major the mil for us
milit military industry uh Israel's just
a bonanza when the US sell gives uh you
know high class Jets to Israel of course
slaked Martin makes a lot of money but
it's more than that when Israel when the
when the United States gives uh Israel
high-tech military equipment that's a
teaser as they call it in the retail
business Saudi Arabia comes along and
says hey we want some of that stuff too
and we want a lot more so Lockheed
Martin is happy to sell uh $60 billion
worth of uh locky Martin and others of
second rate uh equipment to Saudi Arabia
so that they can you know be happy that
they have a lot of this stuff too that
they don't know how to use uh so it's
it's terrific Bonanza for military
industry also Israel provides special
services it can try out Advanced
military equipment against live targets
that's what they're doing all the time
you can't usually do that but Israel is
doing it constantly when they attack
Gaza operation at the West Bank when
they invade Lebanon they've done five
times they are testing Advanced us
equipment figuring out what works and
they develop their own equipment of
course there are major supplier of uh
Advanced military equipment including
equipment for suppression they train us
police forces for example and plenty of
work in the third world in fact when
Reagan was blocked from direct support
for South Africa Israel was used as a
conduit and same in Central America so
there's plenty of services like that but
there's a lot more uh one reason is uh
one factor that tends to be
underestimated I think is Christian
Zionism Christian Zionism goes back way
before Jewish
Zionism way into the 19th century and
it's a very significant Elite phenomenon
in the United States say people like
woodro Wilson Harry Truman and so on
that read the Bible every day you know
and uh are believers in the biblical
prophecies well the Bible says you know
God promised the land to Israel so got
to give it to Israel in the Roosevelt
administration one of the leading Harold
IIs described the return of the Jews to
Palestine as the greatest event in
history by now it's expanded from Elite
Christian Zionism to mass popular
Christian Zionism with the enormous rise
of the uh farri Evangelical Christian
Movement since mainly pretty much in the
1950s it was always around but became
expanded and organized a major base for
the Republican party and they are super
Zion
they're also extremely
anti-semitic their theology if you read
it is uh you have to support Israel
because that'll lead to Armageddon and
everybody gets slaughtered and the souls
that are saved rise to heaven and
everybody
else goes somewhere bad and U including
all the Jews you can't be more
anti-semitic than that but 160,000 Jews
can be saved because they're going to uh
you know recognized Christ in time or so
that's the story there are tens of
millions of Americans who believe this
they're a large part of the base of the
Republican party now it's one of the
reasons why the Republican party is more
extreme in support of Israel than the
Democrats are even though you know the
money and the votes mostly go to
democrats for Jews and liberals uh but
and the another factor which I think is
underestimated is what I mentioned
before the us is a settler colonial
society it's based on extermination of
the native population for the greater
good of all that's the way we you know
that's of course part of the background
so when you see Israel doing the same
thing you should support
it it's just instinctive you know if we
did it it's got to be right by
definition and they seem to be doing it
so you know it's got to be right I think
that's a not negligible Factor in in
addition there is a there's a
significant
Lobby there's an ethnic Lobby which is
powerful but the ethnic lobbies are
pretty Limited in their power I mean
they can be overwhelmed by the major
lobbies instantly I the military Lobby
for example dwarfs ape the Chamber of
Commerce you know the business lobbies
dwarf all of them if they really decided
that their interests were being harmed
they would put the lobby out of business
in no time so they're there but as long
as U their their actions
support the national interest in the
real sense you know the interest of the
powerful you they're influential so you
can get votes in Congress you know 100
Senators
voting recognize the capital of
Jerusalem which then they don't do
things like that uh when the lobby runs
into conflict with real us power it just
backs off they're not idiots and that
happens in case after case but these are
plenty of factors and I think they can
be overcome but we shouldn't
underestimate their significance uh I
have a question along somewhat similar
lines so I'm curious uh I guess you
would probably say that Israel is in a
lot of way acting against its own
self-interest uh according to whatever
National interest definition you choose
to use uh but I'm curious but obviously
the Israelis do not believe that or at
least many Israelis don't believe that
uh so I'm curious why you think Israel
has the policies that it
has um in the short
term Israel is doing quite well to Rich
Western
Society it's
uh know close links to Europe very close
links to the United States uh it's
expanding into the Western in into uh
the West Bank exactly as it wants to
they're not being bothered much you know
there's no other force in the region
that can threaten them I going talk
about the you know custom Rockets from
Gaza but that's pretty much a joke I
mean if is first of all they're don't
want amount to much but and if Israel
wanted to stop them it knows exactly how
to do it in fact we all we should all
know in uh June 2008 the was a truce
between Israel and Hamas which runs Gaza
uh the truce was that the Hamas would
stop would guarant would not fire any
rockets and Israel would drop the siege
well Israel didn't live up to the truce
but Hamas did there were no Rockets
period you can read the Israeli official
website if you like in November uh
Israel invaded Gaza the day of the US
elections and uh killed half a dozen
Hamas militants and then Rockets started
being exchanged and there were
casualties all Palestinian as always in
late December Hamas offered to renew the
truce Israel considered it rejected it
and instead launched operation cast lead
murderous attack on Gaza horrifying
attack that was supported by the US of
course and if they wanted to stop the
Rockets they could reinstate the
truth but as far as they're concerned
they're doing fine in fact the standard
line in Israel is to describe themselves
as a villa in the
jungle Israel's a villa everybody's
enjoying themselves you can go out in
the beach you know go to the restaurants
uh you know nightclubs it's to one of
the gay centers of the world uh the
religious Jews are a pain in the neck
some Palestinians are bother but U
basically it's a pretty nice place for
people who want to for you know
educated relatively wealthy people who
want to live a happy life so why should
they change of course they're facing
serious problems but that almost never
bothers any state I mean take the United
States anybody who's literate knows that
we're marching towards a precipice in
which we might destroy the prospects for
d recent existence in the near term if
you're even literate you know that how
do we react by marching
faster uh when you uh
hear you know euphoric comment like the
New York Times recent a couple of weeks
ago had an eight-page supplement on the
great prospects for the American economy
that we're going to have a hundred years
of energy independent who will become
the Saudi Arabia of the 2st Century uh
will oil fossil fuels become so cheap
will undercut Europe and bring
manufacturing back to the United States
so let's all cheer what's going to
happen as a result of that you all know
we're going to destroy the possibilities
for decent existence for your
grandchildren does it matter no what
matters is uh short-term profit U your
next bonus uh uh that's what's the
national interest in fact the corporate
sector is working overtime with
propaganda campaigns to try to convince
people either there is no global warming
or that the humans have nothing to do
with it in fact you read the business
press like the Wall Street Journal or
Forbes they they not only poo poo it
they say we're moving into a period of
global cooling so let's use as much
fossil fuels as we can they read the
same scientific reports that you do but
who cares we can enjoy ourselves and
enrich ourselves in the short term so
the heck with our
grandchildren It's Not
Unusual hello oh yes so I I want to ask
a questions regarding so you have
discussed the prospect for Palestine
mainly in terms of two major player
which is is Israeli and Americans but
how about other powers for example the
Russian or the
Chinese do they have any interest in
Palestine do they have any interest in
relations with Russia and China yes yeah
in fact um
China I don't know how far it's gone
because it doesn't get reported much but
China has been planning may actually be
proceeding to build a rare line from hia
to aot if you look what that means
it's well I don't think it shows it but
we be down to the Red
Sea Israel's now got deposits of natural
gas off in the Mediterranean and China
would like to have access to them uh and
the easiest way avoiding the sus Canal
which could be blocked is directly to
the Red Sea and then off through the
Indian Ocean and China Pakistan there
building ports in Pakistan and so on so
they have pretty good
relations this project has been
announced how far along it is I'm not
sure but uh China has no object no
serious objection to what Israel is
doing they have
economic interests of economic uh Power
and so on they don't lose anything they
have no particular love with the
Palestinians same with Russia you know
the U Israel and Russia have
fairly decent relations you may have
noticed that Israel was one of the few
countries in the west that uh was very
silent about the annexation of
Crimea uh partly because they're th a
Prejudice their relations with Russia
again the Russians
have one of the part of the tragedy of
the
Palestinians is that they have
essentially no international support for
a good reason they don't have wealth
they don't have power so they don't have
rights it's the way the world works you
know your rights uh correspond to your
power and your wealth same inside the
United States we're not shouldn't be
surprised to see it if you're a poor
black kid in Roxberry you don't have the
rights of a rich person living in the
suburbs right same in the international
Arena so the Palestinians I mean they
may get you know statements of support
but uh nobody's is going to do much for
them especially when the US threatens
anyone who might try to do something
