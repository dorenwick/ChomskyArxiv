[Music]
greetings my name is bill fletcher and i
want to welcome you to
what i know is going to be a fantastic
discussion
uh this we're going to have a discussion
in exchange with dr noam chomsky about
the ukraine war the impact on the left
in the united states and where do we go
from here
and i want to thank you for taking the
time to join us uh for this program
uh this program is brought to you by uh

louis
and a special thanks
to convergence magazine and the real
news network without who this would not
be possible
and we're very very gracious uh
gratified for their involvement
you know we wanted to have a discussion
with noam chomsky
uh
an internationally known iconic figure
uh
uh and then uh someone who has brought
great wisdom and an analysis in looking
at the international situation
and has been outspoken
on the ukraine crisis and the russian
invasion
but we want to probe a little bit
deeply this evening and look at some
issues that go beyond what's often
covered in the media
so
let me just start by
a few stipulations
that noam chomsky and i came to
in the interest of time
one is that we stipulate
that nato is not a defensive alliance
we further stipulate that when the
warsaw pact was dissolved nato should
have itself been dissolved
and we finally stipulate that the
expansion of nato particularly with bill
clinton and george w bush was wrong and
provocative
those are the three important
stipulations in the interest of getting
right into
some central questions that many of us
on the left seem to be avoiding
with no further ado i want to welcome
you gnome to this discussion thank you
very much for doing this
well the
i think these stipulations are correct
and i
would like to add another which i think
is also beyond discussion
uh whatever the
explanation for the
russian invasion
we can important crucial question
of the invasion itself was a
criminal act
a criminal act of aggression
the supreme international crime
on a par with uh
other such
horrific
violations of
international law and fundamental human
rights like the
us invasion of iraq the
hitler stalin invasion of poland and
all too many other examples
so why did it happen
well
there is a background
the background is
what you
began to discuss for
if we go back to
the early 1990s when the
current issue
begins to develop
the soviet union collapsed
president
george h.w bush his
secretary of state james vape baker
then negotiated with
mikhail gorbachev
russian leader
in the bracken ireland were the
major german
political figures on skenchur helmut
cole germany was directly involved in
this
and they reached an agreement
the agreement was it was a firm explicit
agreement there's been a lot of
prevarication about this so
if you want the details i'd simply
suggest looking to the
at the authoritative national security
archive which has the original documents
easily accessible
uh the agreement was that
russia would agree
to allowing
germany to be unified
and to join nato
which is quite a commitment on the part
of russia if you look back to
the history of
the 20th century
but they agreed
on the condition the explicit
formal condition
that nato would not expand one inch to
the east
that commitment was
adhered to
by president bush
bush number one
the early years of
clinton clinton followed
for a couple of years he kept to it too
by 1994
he was already
talking from two sides of his mouth i'm
now
quoting and paraphrasing uh
ambassador chaz freeman one of the
most astute
highly respected
american diplomats who was directly
involved in all of these issues at the
time and has been since
as freeman points out clinton started
talking in
both sides of his mouth
to russia he was saying we'll live up to
the agreement
in the united states domestically
addressing
ethnic minorities like the polish
population and with an eye on domestic
votes
he was saying
we'll do something to bring
frontline states like poland
hungary
slovenia into nato
he was getting
harsh condemnation of this
from his
close
friend supposedly boris yeltsin
who he helped keep in power by
directing interference in russian
elections
yeltsin was strongly objecting
objected again in 1996
1997
clinton went ahead anyway
and broke the agreement to gorbachev
he invited
poland
hungary
slovenia into nato the russians objected
didn't do much about it
1999
a
complicated story can't go into the
details
but the clinton administration decided
to
bomb serbia
close us
russian ally didn't even bother
informing the russians there was a
pretext the pretext is was to
stop uh serbian atrocities in kosovo
the slight problem with that pretext
it requires inverting the chronology
the atrocity
wasn't a pleasant place but the
atrocities were the predicted and
anticipated consequence of the bombing
there is no ambiguity about that there's
been a lot of lying about it inverting
the chronology but it's very firmly
established
well that was this
that was
first of all a
crime in itself but also it it
instigated huge atrocities exactly it
was as was predicted by
the commanding general wesley clark
but also was
undertaken in a way to humiliate russia
the same was true later
under obama with the
bombing of libya and of course the iraq
war in 2003.
russia
didn't like it but accepted it
george w bush
uh he just opened the doors
invited practically everybody and all
the former russian satellites into nato
uh also in 2008
w bush the second bush
invited
ukraine
to join nato
that was vetoed by france and germany
but it was kept
open on the table in deference to the
united states
just about every
high-level
u.s diplomat who with any
familiarity with the
uh
situation including a
current head of the cia and others
warned once again that this is extremely
reckless and dangerous
these are russia's red lines
the heart of their
geostrategic concerns
us went ahead
it continued
the u.s
fact
some say helped instigate
the 2014
maiden uprising
which led immediately to
almost direct
efforts by
what's called nato meaning the united
states to
help
integrate ukraine more or less within
some kind of native style framework
sending weapons training and so on
the most
significant current
information that we have
is an important document of the biden
administration
september
september 1st
2021
you can read it on the
white house
web page i've
quoted it a number of times in
material you can find none
truth out
and it's worth paying attention to
it's been silenced by the u.s press i
haven't seen a single reference to it
but we can be certain that russian
intelligence was reading it
what it says it calls for unquoting it
providing ukraine with
advanced
anti-tank weapons
with a robust training and exercise
program
in keeping with ukraine's status
as a
nato enhanced opportunities partner
basically opens the door wider for
ukraine to join nato
quoted again it finalized a strategic
defense framework
that creates a foundation
for enhancement of
u.s ukraine
strategic defense and security
cooperation
with
advanced weapons training and so on
again in keeping with ukraine status as
a nato enhanced opportunities partner
well that's
that's last september
that's the latest most recent
official statement that we have
about u.s policy
to go back
no so
you've laid out
important background on the
u.s side of this equation
um
what i want to try to get at right now
then
is
how do you analyze the putin regime let
me let me just cut to the chase
on on the night that the invasion was
launched
putin did something that i thought was
highly unusual
instead of harping on nato
which probably would have scored him a
lot of brownie points
he ended up uh denouncing the national
existence of ukraine
calling it national fiction
and and elaborating
things that he had started talking about
in the summer of 2021 he himself
uh that claimed that russia ukraine and
belarus were all the same people
um and
it was a very weird thing for putin to
be saying at that point when he's trying
to justify an invasion he was basically
saying you have no reason to exist we're
coming in and so i want to know from you
how do you analyze the putin regime it's
it's so curious norm no it's like they
are the the russians are very tied in
with transnational capital yet you have
a regime that has a nationalist
expansionist
agenda what do you make of that
well that was indeed the announcement
on the eve of the invasion
and i presume he was
stating
what he has already always believed
as he stated publicly many times
along with many other russians
of the
decision of
gorbachev to
break up the
russian
uh the soviet system which was in fact
an imperial system in which
russia
had
settled non-russian satellites that had
controlled
breaking up the soviet union said it was
a great
tragedy and strategic error
he als this is often quoted
he also said something else which is
rarely quoted
they said that anyone
who wants to reestablish the soviet
union
and its former borders is out of his
mind
and in fact that's true
russia has whatever
putin may believe they
certainly haven't
even the
minimal capacity
to do anything like that
russia is a
state with a
an economy roughly at the size of
spain and italy
it's a weak
kleptocratic uh
raw materials exporting state with a big
army huge army and
advanced nuclear advanced weapons
nuclear weapons
but a
declining
kleptocracy based on raw materials
export
it's not about to conquer anybody
inconceivable
uh ukraine is indeed a special case as
it's been for 30 years
well that was
putin's statement
but there were also
official russian statements at the same
time
about what their precise goals were in
ukraine
they were coming from
sergey lavrov foreign minister
other leading officials
they stated that the goals were the main
goals
were
neutralization
and demilitarization
of ukraine
secondarily
uh establishment of what they call
security
meaning taking over
the donbest regions
uh crimea is just off the table we may
not like it but
it's a fact of life
those were the official
statements about the invasion
what putin has in the back of his mind
is
for his
people is of interest to people
concerned with his mind i'm not i'm
interested in the policies
well those policies
are
basically within the framework
of what everyone knows is the possible
negotiated settlement
it's been true for a long time
before the invasion
was quite clear stated clearly
that any
peaceful settlement
of the
ukraine conflict
will have to
involve what
lavrov called the main goals
neutralization of ukraine
and what they call demilitarization
which means uh
removing
military weapons and
that threaten russia
in other words a status
very much like mexico
it's not written on paper but everyone
with a
brand functioning
knows that mexico
cannot join
a chinese-run
hustle military alliance
within
to quote boyden's position within a
chinese-enhanced
uh
a chinese
regime enhanced opportunities partner
with
china providing
robust
training and exercise programs with the
chinese army and placing
weapons on the mexican border
all of that is just so far out of the
question
that you can't even begin to discuss it
well that's essentially what
lavrov
the official statement was
proposing for ukraine
whether it could have worked
we don't know because the effort wasn't
made to
try it and see if it could work
maybe
instead what we had
was biden's
policy statement which i quoted
uh no
but but here here's the here's my
concern nom
in 1994 the uh
the ukrainians and russians signed the
budapest accords uh in which as you know
the ukrainians gave up their nuclear
weapons and they had the third largest
nuclear arsenal on the planet but they
gave it up on a condition that russia
would never attack them
um and it would be interesting if the if
they hadn't signed that pact what kind
of discussion would be having today but
leaving that aside for a second that was
the agreement um there was very little
interest in ukraine in in joining nato
until 2014
when the crimea is seized and the
russians start supporting these
secessionist movements and so
i i'm concerned when when you're talking
about the
issue of russians wanting security it
doesn't sound like they want security it
sounds like more they wanted a satellite
state
is mexico a satellite state of the
united states
that's a very interesting question uh to
agree for a long part of for much of the
20th century
austria wasn't anybody satellite state
finland wasn't anybody's satellite state
like mexico they were neutral
austria was neutral
by treaty
finland neutral by treaty
they couldn't be as much part of the
west as they liked
they became
western oriented
what we call
capitalist democracies integrated
totally into the western system they had
constraints
they could not enter into a hostile
military alliance
run by the united states which carried
out
uh military maneuvers on their territory
and placed offensive weapons aiming at
russia
is that an infringement of sovereignty
in some sense
but it certainly had no effect on
the life and practice of
austria
finland
switzerland uh
mexico and so on
that's the status that could have been
that might have been achieved for
ukraine if the united states had been
willing
well why the united states why
why when you you place the
responsibility in the united states and
i keep wondering about 2014. i mean if
if if the budapest accord said russia
would not attack
ukraine
in exchange for the nuclear weapons
and in 2014
the russians disenchanted with what was
happening in ukraine seized crimea and
promote uh a secessionist movement in
the east
how does that lead the ukrainians to
even believe that the russians could
stand by a treaty
if they broke one they broke a major one
that's what
so i understand what you're saying about
austria and finland i mean it makes
perfect sense when you have those kind
of that kind of neutralization but this
was
after
ukraine i mean had been the subject of
russian abuse
certainly
ukraine could not assume
that russia
would abide by treaty
any more than
dozens of countries around the world
which have been subjected
to u.s military intervention
could believe that the united states
could have faith that the united states
would observe a treaty
remember
what the russians did in ukraine is of
course criminal
i have to applaud the
new york times editors a couple of days
ago
for quoting
the nuremberg principles
and pointing out
that russia violated them by committing
quoting the supreme international crime
which differs from other war crimes
in that it includes the accumulated evil
of the whole everything that follows
yes
good for the new york times editors to
recognize
to quote that as far as i know for the
first time
in response to russia's violating it but
of course the u.s violates it routinely
i just constantly the u.s violated it
when invaded iraq
when a bomb serbia
when it overthrew the government of
chile
guatemala
did iran
just go on i don't have to go on with
this no it violates it constantly right
it uh
constantly violates
the u.n charter the supreme law of the
land according to the constitution
which bans the threat or use of force in
international affairs
can you think of a single u.s president
who's lived up to the u.s constitution
well
i can't
of course they all violate the supreme
law of the land
and nobody trusts them the question is
are the circumstances such
that
the great powers will
live up to their commitments
not because they're nice guys
they aren't but because those are the
circumstances so let's suppose
that the united states since the 1990s
suppose it had abided by
the warnings of
a whole host of u.s senior statesmen
george kennan
ambassador jack matlock reagan's
ambassador
to russia's leading russian specialist
chaz freeman who i quoted another
ambassador
directors of the cia including the
current director and a long list of
other
high-level diplomats and
government advisers
who had made it clear and explicit
that
violating that though russia
would tolerate
a violation of
bush's
commitment
and
regular humiliation up to a point
they did have a red line
the red line was
again georgia and ukraine
which are deep within the russian
geostrategic heartland as recognized on
all sides
so that was the red line well suppose
the united states had
agreed
with these
high-level advisors and diplomats
and
world opinion
and
germany and france for example and had
recognized the russian red blinds and
agreed to a status for ukraine
that was comparable to
austria
switzerland finland mexico and so on
would russia have invaded
we don't know for sure
but
i think there's a fair probe
there was a way to find out
that was what would be by withdrawing
the september
2021 policy statement which i quoted
and agreeing to
enter into negotiations
to
see if the
general agreed guidelines that could be
met
the only one way to find out to troy
the u.s did the opposite
to quote
ambassador freeman again
the u.s has chosen quoting him
to fight to the last ukrainian
in other words to abandon
any hope for a peaceful settlement
and to ensure that the worst will happen
well i think ambassador freeman is quite
accurate
now would the russians have
committed the supreme international
crime anyway
we don't know
i don't know nobody knows
but there were ways to try to avoid
averted
and those ways were not taken
and are not being taken now
if you take a look at the current
situation there are two major countries
that could do something to try to
alleviate the horrors in ukraine
one of them is china
china could certainly do more to try to
move towards
alleviating the crisis pressed towards
negotiations
and i think china should be criticized
for not doing that
but the criticisms cannot come from the
united states
without
ridicule because china is following u.s
official policy
on the u.s side it's fight to the last
ukrainian and block the prospects for
peace
when
president bush
says
uh
to
a putin you're a war criminal we're
going to bring you to war crimes trials
that's saying
you have no escape
the only choice for you
with your back to the wall
is either commit suicide
or use the capacity that you have
to destroy ukraine and to move on to
nuclear war
again i'm
paraphrasing ambassador freeman and
others who have any concern for the
welfare of ukrainians
those are the options
we don't know
until you try
so
um i hear you the uh
part of my concern though is
so
you're attributing a lot to the role of
the us
um
but
no uh every every nato country has a
veto over the entry of another
country into nato
so
despite what the united states was
pushing there were at least two nato
countries
germany and france that were against the
introduction of ukraine into uh nato
putin knew this
he knew this how do i know he knew it
because i know it and if i know it putin
knew it so the question then is if putin
knew
that there were vetoes against ukraine
going into nato despite all of the
hoopla from the united states
there's something that's missing here
and and then you add on to this
the uh the
uh the claims by putin that this
campaign is about denotifying
uh ukraine i mean it's almost laughable
when you look at the fascist character
the kremlin so
what i mean maybe we disagree or i'm not
sure but what am i missing
you're missing the nature of
international affairs
in international affairs
the fact of the matter is
that the united states has overwhelming
power
other countries exist
they can do something
but when the united states lays down the
law
they follow it
we know that
russia certainly knows it and take our
actions
take for example our
60-year war against cuba
included
kennedy's terrorist war
and brutal harsh destructive sanctions
the entire world opposes them
europe opposes them
take a look at the united nations vote
last vote was
184-2 against them
united states and israel israel's a
satellite has to vote with the united
states so universal opposition
but
universal adherence to them
because they're terrified of the united
states
other countries won't violate
u.s sanctions even though they oppose
them and hate them
because they understand international
affairs
they understand that the united states
is a
violent rogue state which will do what
it wants
do i have to run through the history on
that no no you obviously don't but but
there is
germany had substantial business
dealings with russia right
france was not interested in some sort
of european conflagration
uh all i'm saying is that it's one thing
that go along with the u.s policy when
it's far in the field
what we're dealing with with ukraine
though was was right in the face of the
germans the french and other europeans
and
the nato countries were saying they did
they at least two of them bigger ones
was saying they did not want ukraine in
and they're saying other things too
they hate the cuba sanctions
they hate the iran sanctions
they hate lots of other things that the
united states does
but they adhere to them
because they're terrified of our
violent rogue state
they adhere to them so they oppose them
now to get back to your question if
there had been anyone in the kremlin
with any resemblance to being a
statesman
what they would have done
is quite different from what putin and
the hard men around him decided to do
they would have exploited the
opportunity to bring
france and germany
into
an agreement
pretty much along the line of
gorbachev's common human european home
without military alliances
france and england and germany as you
mentioned
have very good reasons
to want to pursue this possibility
uh president macron france actually
in a very limited way
tried to pursue it with his
abortive negotiated interchanges with
putin uh would have been a very sensible
thing to try to do
that requires statesmanship
okay would it have worked
we don't know
putin and his circle didn't try
they reached for the guns right away
the way other great powers do like the
united states
it was a criminal decision and from
their point of view of utterly stupid
decision
what putin did
was provide the united states on a
silver platter
it's the greatest gift it could imagine
it handed
germany and france
over to the united states
place them deep in the u.s pocket
now totally subordinate to the united
states
when russia's interest including his
interest
would have been to try to draw them out
of the u.s orbit
and into
a framework of the kind that
gorbachev outlined which was not new
incidentally a major issue right through
the cold war
since the second world war
has been
what will be the status of europe
will europe
be subordinate to the united states
within the
nato framework
so-called atlanticist framework
or
will europe become an independent force
in world affairs
along
the lines that
de gaulle outlined
as he put it
europe
from
the atlantic to the euros
with no military blocks
basically gorbachev's vision
that's been on the table for
75 years
major issue
uh they've been moved the united states
of course
approves the
uh nato atlanticist framework
again if there was a statesman
in the kremlin
they would have explored the
goalless
uh gorbachev vision of a european common
home with no military alliances
instead
what they did
is reach for the revolver
carry out criminal aggression
severely harming themselves
giving the united states the greatest
gift it could imagine
going back to china and the united
states
you can imagine a reason why neither of
them why they're both essentially
following the same line
fight to the last ukrainian
and don't do anything
to enhance the possibilities of peaceful
settlement in fact undermine them in the
case of the united states
by backing putin to the wall with no
escape patch
a plausible explanation for this
joint stand of china and the united
states
is that they both
see the evolving situation as
pretty much to their advantage
in chinese case it's driving russia
into becoming a
subordinate
to the chinese growing
system the
grass china is developing a
huge system of
development
loans the
extending through central asia
corporating
south asia
moving
to turkey
soon probably to central europe
moving to africa
uh even to southeast asia even to u.s
domains in latin america
if they can draw russia's already part
of it but if russia can become
a subordinate member of it
providing
raw materials
heavy weapons
its specialty
but nothing else as it declines
that's to china's advantage
what about the united states
putin in his criminal foolishness
gave the united states
everything that american
strategists could want put europe
deep in the u.s pocket
now they do whatever the united states
says in fact they're going quite wild
you know like
in italy uh cancelling lectures on
dostoevsky
kicking
the russians out of the russian cats out
of an international cat conference
the u.s hawks couldn't want anything
more
also pouring increasing their military
expenses
there's joy in the lockheed martin
headquarters you can be certain
uh also there's joy in the exxon mobil
headquarters because what's happening
one of the most important things that's
happening
is that the slim
chances of escaping
disaster catastrophe
by destroying the environment those slim
chances are being reduced
may be eliminated
the offices of exxon mobil
the joy is overflowing not concealed
they won't they've got these
annoying environmentalists out of their
hair
they now want to be loved
or as they put it they want to be hugged
their work because now they're saving
civilization
by increasing the production of fossil
fuels and driving the world
to total catastrophe
they want to be hugged for it
so there's plenty of joy
in
focus strategic circles and
military production
fossil fuel circles so why do anything
to try to save ukrainians
why not continue
to fight to the last ukrainian
so
so noam
you are placing
a lot of emphasis on what the role of
the united states has been
in laying the foundation for this crisis
and
uh and i want to better understand
what's going on in the putin regime
you have talked quite eloquently about
the criminality of the putin regime
i'm thinking about what putin did to the
chechnyans i'm thinking about what was
done
uh with the russian intervention in the
syrian uprising and the
brutal bombings that the the russians
were engaged in and other kinds of
activities
and and in that sense
i see a line
that goes from chechnya
to ukraine
that is not just about the role of the
united states except and insofar as
perhaps competition
uh
how do you look at that
chechnya's
was ugly
vicious
destructive
but it is within the russian federation
ugly
we've got plenty of examples
take syria
syria
what was happening
it was
it was criminal and murderous and
destructive but if we want to know the
reasons they're not obscure
uh the united states france germany
were supporting
opposition forces
which by
2013 2014 were mostly jihadi forces
which were fighting against the
recognized government of syria
the government that has a seat in the
united nations and is
internationally recognized they were
trying to overthrow it
that's a russian ally
the cia was providing
advanced weapons to the opposition
forces
advanced anti-tank weapons which did
stop the assad armies
quite predictably
didn't take a genius to predict it
i did many other people did the russians
reacted
they came into the war
really for the first time
brought
moved in to
destroy the
cia
supplied
anti-tank weapons
then they went on to continue to support
assad's
brutal
and vicious recon
effort to reconquer
syria
horrible atrocities and so on
technically it's not criminal
but certainly not illegal but it's
criminal in the moral sense not in the
legal sense well that's
how that's what happened in syria yeah
well i mean we if we had more time i'd
like to go more into
uh syria in part because
um i
i
don't see
the uh
i think that one of the things that
you're discounting
is that there was a real uprising in
syria
in syria in syria or the real uprising
um and that the us was very ambivalent
about that uprising for a while but i've
more wanted to get
that could be for our next interview no
but for this one
there was an uprising was part of the
arab spring
right a democratic reformist uprising
assad crushed it with extreme violence
that led on to the
civil war
gradually
the jihadi forces
uh took pretty much took over
you can debate the details but
by
2013 2014 according to
the most informed observers that i know
there was a largely jihadi based
opposition
which the us was supporting
uh
attempting to overthrow the government
brutal murderous government responsible
for most of the crimes
but happened to be the
internationally recognized government
which is a russian ally
so when it got to the point that the cia
was
providing advanced weapons by 2015
not surprisingly predictably the
russians moved in to destroy them
then it went on
to the rest of the destruction of syria
is it pretty
no it's very ugly
uh nobody believes that the russians are
saints
but they're
they are
an imperial power
minor in comparison with the united
states
as i said before they're
as an economy they're on a par with
italy and spain
advanced weapons
uh they are
you we don't have to
recall that russia was
invaded
and virtually destroyed
twice in the 20th century
by germany alone
now the idea of
a
advanced
a hostile military alliance
run by the world's
most
most powerful and indeed most aggressive
state
which is
providing
in last september
enhancing
its strategic and defense cooperation
with ukraine with a robust and exercise
program in keeping with ukraine status
as a nato enhanced opportunities partner
serious threat to russia
translation
china and mexico
is it really a threat i mean we're
talking about
2022 it's not 1941.
until
2021 right okay
right no so 2021 but is it was it really
a threat i mean let's i mean we're not
talking there is the likelihood of a
massive
uh land assault on russia
is about as likely as my going to the
moon tomorrow
this is the this is the this is the 21st
century we're not talking about
operation barbarossa of 1941
and and russia has the most nuclear
weapons on this planet
when we talk i mean one of the concerns
gnome is that when we talk about
security and this concern for russian
security
i start wondering who's concerned about
ukrainian security and who's concerned
about the security of the countries that
are bordering on russia that seem to
have been in a complete panic after the
soviet union collapsed where does that
fit in
in terms of some sort of more
comprehensive approach to security let's
take a look
there was no threat whatsoever to the
security of austria
finland the baltic countries germany
the west is now
euphoric about the fact that the russian
military is incapable of capturing
cities
30 kilometers from its border
there was no threat to those countries
expressed
or
conceivable
if you wanna
there is a threat from the united states
why do you think world opinion
regards the united states
as the most dangerous country in the
world
the world opinion overwhelmingly nobody
else is
okay right
there's a reason for that the united
states does what it wants
invaded iraq
destroyed the country
killed hundreds of thousands of people
uh
laid the basis for
ethnic conflicts that are tearing the
region apart
basis for isis
remember the nuremberg tribunal that's
not foreign back in history invasion of
afghanistan not far back in history the
united states remains a violent power
we don't talk about it but in the global
south they can see
that the united states right now
right at this moment
is purposely consciously enhancing
some of the major criminal acts in the
in the world right now
right now
millions of afghans
after 20 years of u.s invasion and
destruction
right now millions of afghans are facing
literal starvation
there's food in the markets
there are people who have some money
but they have to watch their children
store
because they can't go to the bank
to get a little bit of money to buy food
in the market
why
because the united states has stolen
their money their money
but no see i i hear you and i'm not here
i understand i'm but i'm not here to
defend the united states as you well
know um but what i am saying is that
there are multiple imperial powers on
this planet right right and one of the
things about the
alleged russian fear of what was
happening in the ukraine is that up
until 2014
ukraine was not interested in getting
into nato
but when the russians
intervened in the internal affairs of
ukraine grabbing crimea promoting the
secessionist movements those things
changed so all of a sudden you have then
a growing sympathy which is completely
logical because the country is being
torn apart
it's not pretty but it's very logical
you're skipping what happened in 2014
in 2014 there was a
uprising or coup call it what you want
which throughout
the elected government
parliamentary government
refused the offer of the
president to have a
referendum
or a vote and caused him to flee the
country
and return the country or admit with
direct u.s involvement to have to repeat
to you the
leaked material about
victoria nuland
now our
point person on ukraine
discussing secretly who we are going to
work to
bring to be the next president should it
be yachts should it be somebody else
direct u.s involvement to
establish a government that would be pro
us instead of the former pro
russian government well russia could
have just stood by and clapped
as we could have stood by and clapped if
a pro-chinese government was established
in mexico
calling for a military alliance with
china
i rather doubt that we would have done
that
you can decide but russia didn't do it
they moved in and supported the eastern
sections mostly
mostly russia-oriented population mixed
population and they moved to take crimea
for reasons that every strategic analyst
understands
you want to go back to chaz freeman yeah
he just described it every western
analyst understands it
crimea
which incidentally is very pro-russian
to crime and accepted the
annexation crimea is the base
for the only russian
warm water port
they're not like the united states but
it was ukrainian territory
it was ukrainian territory what
and and with crimea it was ukrainian
territory from 1954 on ukraine
it had been recently handed over to
ukraine traditionally it had been
russian territory
the home
i'm not justifying it i'm giving the
explanation that's given by every u.s
strategic analyst and high-level
diplomat
russia had
its only warm water ports including
naval bases in ukr in crimea
they were being immediately threatened
by the pro-us government
that was
had took power with direct u.s
involvement i was beginning to move
towards
joining
slowly into
preliminary moves towards nato so yes
russia moved in for
re you can say it was wrong fine but
don't say it was not understandable no
no i i hear you loud and clear but as a
leftist
i'm not thinking about power politics or
great power politics i'm thinking about
issues of sovereignty self-determination
just like when when when reagan claimed
that the sandinista victory put the
sandinistas within driving distance of
the texas border it's like we just like
ridiculed that position
um but let me just say this uh norm
because we have five minutes and i know
you have another interview
um and i and i wanted to give you a
minute before you went to your other
interview
and and so i wanted to thank you i
wanted uh to just ask you
uh just a final quick question
which is
there are many people in the u.s left
that seem to feel that there's nothing
that we can do about
putin influence one way or another and
that we should not even try
do you have recommendations on how we in
the united states particularly the left
and progresses should be looking at what
to do
first of all as leftists we should be
posed opposed to
all imperialism should be imposed
overthrowing governments
to
in to aggression and violence
and as
human beings
who are sensible and moral
we should concentrate
our attention
energy and activism on what we can do
happens overwhelmingly to be the actions
of our own government
which happens to be the leader in the
world
world championed by four
in opposing sovereignty
in aggression in violence and
interference in terrorism and so on
we can we should oppose
russian
imitation
of our actions what can we do about it
well i think it's very clear
there are two options
the ones i mentioned before
one option is the one we're adopting
fight to the last ukrainian
to quote ambassador freeman again
and ensure
that the russians have there that putin
in a circle are backed up against the
wall
no exit no way out
therefore they'll have
the option of
basic option of destroying ukraine and
moving towards
global war that's one option happens to
be the one we're following there is
another option
abandon the policies are official
policies
those i quoted
move towards
accepting
a status for ukraine which is similar to
mexico
austria
finland
for decades
move towards establishing that
stop withdraw the
threats
to
russia that are explicit in the policy
statement i mentioned the move towards
some kind of
minsk 2 style
arrangement for
the high level of autonomy for the
eastern region maybe within a federal
settlement
recognize the reality
that like it or not crimea is off the
table it's not a negotiating option now
that's ugly
but the alternative is continue our
efforts to destroy ukraine and to move
towards an international war
those are the choices
world is not a pretty place
you don't have the choice of
electing martin luther king as the head
of every government
