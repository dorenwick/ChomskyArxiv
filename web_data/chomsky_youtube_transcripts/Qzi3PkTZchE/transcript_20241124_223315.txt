the conflict of the Islam Shrine is just
one of many uh there's conflicts over
confiscation of land over settlement the
attack on Gaza the last one was the most
Savage and brutal of the series that
have occurred the next one will be worse
uh the conflict is not Israel Palestine
actually I wrote a book uh
right around when this organization was
founded in
1983 called faithful
triangle us Israel
Palestinians that conflict persists
largely because of us as long as the
United States just take a look at the
history again it's kind of mostly
suppressed here you can find it easily
there is an overwhelming International
consensus inclus everyone on a at least
a shortterm resolution of the immediate
conflict that's what's called a two
State sett on the proposal is for two
states on the internationally recognized
border soal green line with un quoting
it now with guarantees for the security
of each state to and their right to
exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized Bo
that's virtually the entire world
actually I'm quoting from a resolution
brought to the security Council in
January
1976 by the three leading Arab states
Egypt Syria and Jordan it was vetoed by
the United States there was another one
in 1980 same story it goes right up to
the present run through as long as the
United States continues to provide the
decisive economic military diplomatic
support for Israeli actions and also the
ideological support in the way the
issues are framed understood what's
known what isn't know as long as this
continues there's no reason to expect
Israel to back off from the policies
it's pursuing and you can see exactly
what they are they're not a secret for
the last 20 years uh one major Israeli
policy backed by the United States has
been to separate Gaza from the West Bank
that's in violation of the Oslo Accord
signed right at that time which declared
that they're territorial unity and
there's a reason for that you look at a
map you can figure it out uh Gaza offers
the only opening to the outside world
for any kind of Palestinian entity that
might develop if it separ seated from
the West Bank any autonomy in the West
Bank's imprison so that's one policy the
Gaza kept under a vicious Siege Savage
brutal Siege the savagery is
Indescribable just a couple of days ago
we was talking about this a Norwegian
doctor MZ Gilbert very heroic Doctor Who
go every time there's an attack on Gaza
he and a couple of others go to work in
the alifa hosal Hospital the main
hospital is a trauma surgeon and uh he's
done amazing work and he also describes
what's happening Israel just barred him
from going to Gaza why they don't want
people to go there and put together the
you know the people they're destroying
and tell the world about it but that's
one part and that's going to continue as
long as we back it uh in the West Bank
what Israel is doing is very clear it's
taking over everything it finds of value
and you can see what it is Big area
around Jerusalem much bigger Jerusalem
greater
Jerusalem corridors going to the east
there's one right to the east of
Jerusalem Cuts all the way through
practically to Jericho bisects the West
Bank a lot of that was built under
Clinton you know clear purposes BC the
West CL a couple of other carers up
north which bisect more areas taking
over the Jordan Valley kicking out the
inhabitants building settlements that
imprisons what's left taking over
everything within the so-called
separation wall which is of course IL
legal in like all of these actions are
illegal recognized to be illegal by the
whole world uh but they go on and
they'll go on as long as we back them
end result will be kind of a greater
Israel uh including the areas that
describe heavily settled very few
Palestinians are either being driven Out
start with uh and a couple of
Palestinian cantons left um this is all
in accord with the official policy of
the governing Party The Party official
program says there cannot be any
Palestinian
self-determination of West of Jordan uh
actually if you look at their founding
document way back it says that what's
contemporary Jordan is also part of the
land of Israel well that they can't
quite manage but that's there's every
reason to expect this to go on as long
as you and I allow it and that's what it
comes down
to American policy is decisive in this
respect and there's no reason it's not
you know it's not Graven and stone it
can change it's changed in other case
changed in the case of take South Africa
which people use as an
analogy the United States great Ronald
Reagan who was an extreme racist was the
last defender of a part the whole world
that turned against rean was actually
overriding Congressional vetos and when
they were passed over his veto we
disregarded them anyway the US continued
to support the terrorist arm Army and
that go of the South African back
terrorist Army even after South Africa
had backed off
from nobody else in the world was
supporting the US did finally change its
policy there are a lot of reasons for
that go into it but it did finally and
that part ended not a marvelous Solution
by any means it's a victory and there
other cases this is an extremely
powerful country
John Quincy Adams 200 years ago
described the United States as a
dangerous
Nation dangerous that anybody who's
nearby obviously dangerous to the
indigenous population virtually
EXT dangerous to the slaves dangerous to
Spanish Florida which the US conquered
dangerous to Mexico us conquered half of
Mexico that's why you have Spanish names
in all the cities in California Mexico
and so on dangerous to Canada US invaded
Canada several times it was beaten back
by the British later on it was dangerous
to the Philippines and Cuba and Puerto
Rico wherever to gree it's a very
powerful country and power carries
danger so also a very frightened country
like why when the United States cens you
know maybe a thousand military bases
around the world they're all called
defense and for the American population
I think they're seen that way we're
defending ourselves we're defending what
we own which is the
world we literally we have the world
we've got to defend it and if they come
after us we got to stop them this is
often said straight out like take Lyndon
Johnson is kind of a man of the people
honest man of the people he once gave a
very interesting speech in Asia
1966 he was speaking to American troops
and what he said was he said there's 15
million of us and three billion of them
and if Mike takes if mik means right
they're going to sweep over us and take
what we have so we have to stop them in
South
Vietnam that's deeply ingrained in
American culture and uh that's what the
Thousand bases are for that's it's even
an American rhetoric so a major issue in
American post second world war domestic
policy is What's called the loss of
China who is responsible for the loss of
China that was the source of carthis you
know find people responsible the loss of
China that when Kennedy was escalating
in Vietnam part of his concern was he
might be blamed for the loss of Indo
China and we can't accept losses
can I lose your
computer no I can't I can lose my
computer I can't lose yours but it's
just assumed that we own everything so
we might lose it and it's threatened
because all of them out there coming
after us and so we have to have this
huge military machine we have to
intervene all over we have to invade
Grenada Nicaragua whatever it is uh and
these things are deeply rooted cultural
properties they go way back in American
history they're hard to dismantle and
there's a huge educational job to do
so
go incoming Congress and the issue of
Iran and more troops returning to
Iraq what is your sense on the the
direction things are going I'll start
with the ren
uh Iran is
described regularly by political leaders
by the press as the greatest threat to
World
Peace it is that's not what the world
thinks we know what we can find out what
the world thinks not by reading the
American Press which doesn't report it
but last year there was a major poll
International poll by the Gallup polling
agency it's pretty much equivalent in
which one of the questions was which
country is the greatest threat to World
Peace the United States by a huge margin
and nobody else was even close second
way below was Pakistan and that was
probably inflated by the
Indian but that's the world opinion here
the greatest threat to the world p is
Iran why uh well basically because Iran
isn't following American orders uh
remember it's now since 1953 that 60
years not a day has passed that the
United States hasn't been torturing Iran
literally 1953 there was a us run
military coup that overthrew the
Parliamentary Government installed the
brutal Tyrant he had a horrible human
rights record that went on until 1979
he was
overthrown uh and since then Iran has
been kind of independent and that's not
permitted the us immediately turned to
supporting its friends Saddam Hussein
great friend of R Reagan George Bush uh
and their attack on Iran which was no
small business the US provided Aid
arms other European countries provided
the materials chemical
weapons the alliance was so close but
the US basically won the war for Iraq um
The Alliance was so close that in
1989 Bush and Bush one then president
actually invited Iraqi nuclear Engineers
to the United States for Advanced
Training in weapons
production and after that various other
things happened the United States smash
of Iraq Iran remains an enemy it still
is
independent the concern allegedly is
that they might develop nuclear weapons
well I don't know us intelligence has no
information that they're developing
nuclear weapons they are developing
nuclear power there actually that was
under us initiative when Iran was under
the Sha our Ally the United States
that's Kissinger Cheney rville the rest
of them were
pressuring uh Iran to develop nuclear
power my own institution
MIT big blow up on campus when it was
discovered in the 70s that the MIT
nuclear engineering department under
pressure from the government was taking
in Iranian nuclear Engineers to train
them in nuclear power
right now no good anymore they're an
enemies actually Kissinger was pretty
honest it was asked by the Press at one
point how come you supported Iraqi
nuclear power in the
1970s but you think it's the greatest
threat the world peace now he said well
they were an ally
then yeah that's it is there a way to
deal with the nuclear issue in Iran
plenty of ways one way was just
announced a couple of days ago repeating
earlier proposals they sent out their
low enrich uranium to another country
and in return get the ice Toes that they
need for their medical reactors that was
actually proposed
by there was an agreement in 2010
between Brazil turkey and
Iran EXA pretty much exactly that as
soon as it was announced the United
States bitter Al condemn Brazil for
daring to do this the
Brazilian foreign minister was pretty
upset by it it's name
Cesar he uh released a letter from
Obama to president Lula of Brazil in
which Obama had actually proposed this
probably assuming that Iran wouldn't
accept it well that kind of went over
like the usual lead balloon but uh that
was blocked uh in
2012 December
2012 there was supposed to be a
conference an International Conference
in Helsinki to take steps towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East very good move to
Carri forward overwhelming support for
it in the world it's Advanced mostly by
the Arab states uh Israel refused to
attend the conference then everyone was
waiting to see what Iran will do Iran
said they would attend the conference
with no
preconditions a couple of days later the
US canceled the
conference that would not even reported
in the United States but there are
plenty of ways to deal with this alleged
greatest threat to World Peace but
they're not being pursued and the new
Congress is going to make it a lot worse
uh the new Congress it it's the McCain
La you know just bomb everybody in sight
we got to make sure that
Iran can't do anything unless we allow
it there is a proposal on the table
right now the Iran Russia agreement uh
it does require that the United States
lift sanctions and that's probably
what's going to hold it up you'll see
but in the next couple of weeks Congress
will probably refuse any uh move
to uh reduce or eliminate the sanctions
which is of course the quit Pro quot and
if they do we'll have squash that
possibility but again those are not
things that have to happen if there's
enough
serious activism and protest here that
could
change well I know we could go on all
night I've been told that we are out of
time and there's considerations happen
