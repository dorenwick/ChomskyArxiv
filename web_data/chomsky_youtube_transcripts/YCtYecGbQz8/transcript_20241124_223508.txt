Professor n ksky thank you for taking
the time to meet with us very pleased to
be with you we had to come all the way
to Aman Jordan uh to talk to you well
you get a free trip yeah well I was
thinking that um you should send the
flower to the bordal control official
who said that you can go into the
territories actually B thought to send
the the thanks since it publicized the
talk which otherwise no one would have
ever heard of I mean I've talked to
brette before and nobody ever knew we
were meeting you after the talk the
conference talk the video talk that you
gave to bate was there anything in that
talk that um might have um I talked
about you it was mostly it was about the
United States it was uh US foreign
relations so of course the Middle East
came up and I talked about Israel
Palestine but I mean it doesn't compare
to talks that I've given in
Israel you know the U Ministry of
interior apologized and claimed that it
was a simp
misunderstanding that's certainly false
it was perfectly well understood the uh
uh the Border official was in constant
contact with the ministry and he was he
he played no role he was simply
referring questions and comments from
the ministry and uh they understood
everything and their reasons were very
clear and explicit why what do you think
the reasons were I presume they're the
ones that kept coming back from the
ministry that he kept asking over and
over one was he did mention well they
they don't like your you know they don't
like your views the government so I said
yes it's try to find one government in
the world that does Like My Views has it
happened to you in any other country in
the world well there this one case of a
country which wouldn't allow me in uh
that was Czechoslovakia under the
Russians in 1968 it's hard to think of a
case outside of totalitarian states
where someone has been refused entry
because they've been invited to give a
talk at a particular
University so I guess you're going to
use this I can hear your your lectures
now in the US campuses that could I
haven't intended to say anything about
it if I'm asked all and why didn't you
try to come in after the U after the the
ministry apologize well I just I don't
have time I have a short trip several
countries to visit I'll go on to the
next country so you were here in Jordan
bate you were planned to go to bate and
tomorrow you leaving for Beirut and
there's simply no time to add anything
and is it intentional the fact that you
haven't been to Israel in what 12 13
years is it I no more intentional than
the fact that I haven't been to Brazil
for the same number of years or
Argentina or that I've never been to
countries that I constantly invited to I
mean I have a very
intense uh series
of requests for visits I can't take a
fraction just it's just a matter of a
timetable
mainly the matter of the timeable and
what's high on the agenda so uh by the
way we could have conducted this
interview in Hebrew right you speak
fluent
Hebrew I'm Rusty if it was 50 years ago
yes your father was a Hebrew Professor
yeah and I I lived in Israel for a while
and my Hebrew was was obviously an
American accent but it was fluent uh I
can still read perfectly well but uh I
wouldn't trust myself to speak I have to
think too hard to get the words out you
know I think it emphasized the
complexity of the issue because on the
one hand you I mean you speak Hebrew and
you come from a Jewish Family and you
talked about anti-Semitism when when you
were young and you you lived on a kibuts
and you actually considered staying and
living in Israel and on the other side
you're the most outspoken critic of
Israel and I mean you undermine Israel's
existence right to exist that's quite
false in fact I don't regard myself as a
Critic of Israel I regard myself as a
supporter of Israel the people who are
harming Israel in my opinion and it's
what I've said many times are those who
claim to be supporting it they are Drive
helping Drive Israel towards a moral
degeneration and possible Ultimate
Destruction I think support for Israel
should be uh uh support for policies
which are to its benefit not but you
talk about the fact that you don't
support the right of Israel to exist as
a Jewish State I don't
report the Israeli public saw you go and
shake hands with's leader nah just
couple of days before he started the
bombing Israel and so not a couple of
days before and furthermore they saw
pictures of me meeting Nala but they
didn't see pictures of me meeting his
main enemy with whom I spent much more
time while he Jim blood what's happening
is that when I went to Lebanon uh as in
any other country I try to find out as
much as I can about the country if I
have a little time so I met uh with the
uh ah head of hasbalah it's a major
political force in Lebanon in fact in
the last elections the Coalition that
they it's also this this leader who's
calling the Dem demolition of Israel and
actually what hb's position has been is
that any position that the Palestinians
accept they'll accept he doesn't think
Israel should exist okay I mean he has
so many missiles which are aiming Israel
and now he's aiming to to bomb Tel Aviv
but you know even there sorry he has
missiles but they're used for deterrence
now let's go back a step you said I'm
calling for the destruction of Israel or
some words like that no that you I don't
think it should exist as a Jewish State
yeah I don't think the United States
should exist as a Christian State I
don't think that Pakistan should exist
as an Islamic State but there's a big
difference because United States and
Pakistan there is no nation in the world
calling for their destruction and having
a nuclear weapon like Iran for example
and like Iran does not have nuclear
weapons not calling for the destruction
it is calling for the destruction J is
very specific in saying that these are
quotations that are appear in the
Israeli press I heard him say that in
his voice no what he what he said is I
don't approve of it he said in the he
was quoting uhi that during a period
when Israel was very close to Iran and
didn't mind ji saying it he said in the
end of time Israel will disappear words
like that no he was very specific and
and but but look the Israel is in a
position of security well beyond that of
many other states which do not and if in
so far as they call themselves not
states of their citizens but states of a
particular category of citizens I object
to it in principle so what should I
understand from your words what are you
telling Israelis go back to
Europe live as a minority here in Israel
take a chance history sit on the beach
what do you exct from your what was your
action tomorrow morning exactly what I
write a thousand times though I was
opposed to the existence of a Jewish
State and that was part of the Zionist
movement remember as a as a Zionist
youth leader yes I was opposed to the
forming a Jewish State once it was
formed
1948 uh my position has consistently
been that Israel should have all the
rights of every state in the
International System no more and no less
now Israel demands more and I don't
agree with that now duritz you know I
two weeks ago I interviewed dersovitz on
on this show and he said that uh quote
you are our enemy's biggest assets are
Israeli bashing Jews Like Professor hsky
well that's a problem for DTS I have no
interest in what he said he's a I mean
if you want the truth he's a dedicated
liar who's been exposed over and over
again he didn't quote me you notice he
he didn't because he knows better than
to quote uh by the way he offered to
come to bade to debate you do you think
that they would invite a person like
dvit to come and talk in beade you have
to ask beade that doesn't make any
difference to me but uh uh uh I mean
I've agreed to debate him reluctantly
because he's extremely dishonest but I
do it uh but but this issue is Extreme
there's nothing to debate I mean Israel
should have the rights of any state
period it wants more because its right
to exist is questionable on other many
other states in the world but no state
the United States doesn't demand that
Mexico uh accept the right of the United
States to exist sitting on sitting on
half sitting on half of Mexico because
there isn't a threat when you hear and
listen what Hamas leaders say what Iran
leaders says what leaders say you
understand that there's an immediate
threat on Israel you don't understand
that in 1970s when this claim was made
for the first time as far as I know it
was when Egypt and 1971 offered Israel a
full peace treaty full peace treaty
nothing for the Palestinians 1971 Israel
rejected it because it would have meant
withdraw from the Sinai it's the only
state I know of which wants recognition
of its right to
exist is there any relevance to the fact
that you're Jewish do you think when you
make these claims when you when you you
preaching this since I'm Jewish and
since I have a special relationship with
Israel since child and since I care
about it I think it should take U
positions that are moral
realistic uh and appropriate for its own
decent survival and aren't you afraid
that even you if you feel that you're
working for Israel your arguments and
you're the very articulated in making
your arguments and are well heard
because of your world reputations aren't
you afraid that these arguments will be
misused from the academic boycott to to
the nuclear weapon in Iran well actually
the academic boycott if you bother to
read is one that I've opposed it's true
it's true that my statements will be
misused for example by dertz uh who is
very dangerous for Israel but yes he
he's dangerous for Israel extremely and
he distorts and misrepresents my
statements in ways which help his cause
of supporting Israeli aggression and
expansion which is very dangerous for
Israel but even if I can understand or
try to understand the academic
philosophical approval of a person like
you for the freedom of speech even if
Holocaust
deniers not even specifically it's
specifically for views you detest that
for which you call Freedom up to a
certain point up to a certain point
because history has proved otherwise I
mean you're doesn't matter you you're
taking a lot of responsibility on your
arms I'm I believe in freedom of speech
for Alan dtz even though the record of
his exposed lies is incredible you're
bothered by desist lies and you're not
bothered by the lies of Holocaust
deniers on a contrary I'm not I'm not
the I'm not saying I'm bothered by their
it's wise I say yes we should insist on
the freedom of speech for dedicated
Liars uh and in the case of say the
Holocaust denial yeah that's of course
outrageous just as it's outrageous to
deny what we did namely wiping out
millions of Indians but you know the
number one I think argument uh against
uh what you preach for is the double St
double standards saying that you know
from Talking of freedom of speech in
countries where freedom of speech is
does not exist you're going to Lebanon
tomorrow or when you go to uh um even
here in Jordan I don't think it's
limited compared to Israel is Israel as
bad as other countries did I ever say
that but you spend so much time uh
targeting Israel did Amnesty
International ask me to give a talk uh
that they could use uh to criticize uh
uh human rights violations in Israel no
they did it for Syria but said you have
limited time looking in the map in the
world there are so many problems why is
Israel in the center Israel still if you
look around is you know is trying is
struggling he trying to give democracy
away and has gay rights and human rights
if you started by asking why is Israel
in the center answer it isn't not for me
uh what's in the center for me is the
United States and for a very Elementary
moral reason uh the moral principle is
we are responsible for our own actions
and their consequences uh every crime
that Israel commits is because of us
participation and authorization so any
decent American citizen even without a
special interest in Israel as I have uh
should have these in the center of their
attention because those are the ones
we're participating in we're responsible
for and respons but what is worse than
your eyes the actions in Israel and in
the territories or for example what's
going on in Afghanistan now where how do
you how do you prioritize these two
there's no way to because I talk about
both of them all the time uh but is
Israel as what's going on in Israel as
severe as what's going on in darur
Afghanistan darur in the case of darur
yes the crimes are worse but there is
much less that I could do about them
much less almost nothing in fact so yes
it's fine to sign petitions criticizing
them but there's no moral value to that
and you feel moral value because a
you're a citizen of the US and B you
have connections to Israel and you feel
that you're part of the let's put aside
the personal connection to Israel which
is there but if I had no connection to
Israel at all as simply as an American
citizen okay it would be of prime
concern because the US is decisively
involved Israel for example could not uh
attack Gaza could not carry out the
occupation and so on without decisive
and direct us diplomatic military and
economic support you know I think you're
taking a lot of responsibility here a
person should take responsibility for
what they are responsible for yeah but
you are so uh
convinced uh for many years in in your
theories you obviously don't see an
existential danger to Israel there is a
danger it's posing a danger to itself
you see only from that you're thinking
you're asking Israelis Israeli
government to take a risk you're saying
for I'm I'm going back to the nuclear um
issue because let's take the nuclear
issue there's a way to what if you're
wrong that's what I'm asking look you
have to make judgments on the basis of
your best assessment of the facts
available so that there's no but as
shouldn't we learn from history there
were voices before the world war who
didn't take Hitler that serious and and
history unfortunately proved us wrong
how can you be so sure that Amad is not
going to Wi Israel you can't be sure so
therefore what you should do is take
steps to mitigate the threat to the
extent that it exists the obvious step
to take to mitigate the threat is to
move towards instituting a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
region okay that will mitigate the
threat that is the threat so excuse me
that's important now Israelis who don't
want to do that are harming Israel but
in your eyes you're quite sure that this
there is no immediate threat on Israel
right from outside of Israel the thre is
I think Israel what if you're wrong what
if you're wrong and people are using
your argument to to to um to have the
International Community look the other
way suppose those who claim there's a
threat are wrong and in fact by making
that claim they're harming Israel yeah
that's perfectly possible in fact it's
true so whatever position you take
there's a possibility that it's wrong if
you have the interests of Israel at
heart then what you would want to do is
reduce the possibility of any nuclear
threat in the region and there is an
immediate way to do that with which is
supported virtually by the entire world
uh and that is to move towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
with and so let's let's do that well
Israel is refusing and the United States
is refusing now they repeat the words
they say oh yes it's nice idea but they
say we can't do it until there's a
comprehensive peace settlement well
that's saying we can't do it period now
What's blocking a comprehensive peace
settlement well we know the answer uh
the United States and Israel
are opposed to the World on the exist on
on a political settlement on the
international border with maybe along
the lines of the taba negotiations uh
which would lead to a comprehensive
peace settlement uh everyone in the
world is supporting that now by opposing
that your favorite one in the world and
then you go on I it is it is
questionable people it's not that sure
that the the Palestinians can go through
with this agreement they have the Hamas
on one hand they have the F I'm just
saying that look
every relevant actor is in favor of this
now Israel and the United States are not
only opposed to in words they're
blocking it in Deeds uh furthermore
international law is in favor of it okay
that's that's of course your opinion
it's not my opinion that's where the
look The occupied territories uh Israeli
actions in the occupied territories with
us crucial us backing are first of all
illegal Israel recognized that in 1966 s
uh they're illegal and they're harmful
well unfortunately we can't solve that
problem we can agree though it's a
complex situation it's not black and
white but I understand that while your
parents were were alive it was you were
more cautious in making those arguments
against against Israel I don't make
arguments against Israel I make
Arguments for isra for Israel okay
making these Arguments for Israel as you
say was it was it a factor I mean was it
hard for you because I didn't I was
unhappy about the fact that they were
subjected to a series of Tantrums from
hysterics in the United States but I
said the same things and in fact they
approved of them so when you when in
Israel they consider you to be an
someone who is harming Israel does it
hurt you personally I mean the the
public opinion I mean the public opinion
is reading what you're presenting to
them what I'm asking does it does it are
you does it offend you personally are
you upset that that is the ption I'm
upset by the fact that people in other
countries in the world think I'm the
greatest danger to their country is it
tiring tiring
yeah I I expect it any disident and
critic can anticipate that they're going
to be subjected to hysterical tyraids if
you're a Soviet dissident did you expect
to be treated nicely in fact do you
think of a dissident in any country
who's treated nicely let's go back in
history let's take Israel okay you go
back to the Bible you studied the Bible
I'm sure yeah uh in the Bible there is
someone who's called a hater of Israel
the Prophet Elijah uh King Ahab you know
the epitome of evil in the Bible so in a
way you see yourself as a as a as a
prophet I'm not saying that no no I'm
seeing the prophets as intellectuals so
it's it's your life mission and
therefore even not my life's Mission
it's the mission of any decent human
being well take Elijah or Jeremiah or
Isaiah any of them were they treated
nicely no they were treated very badly
uh Elijah was called a hater of Israel
you know hater of Israel centuries later
he was honored but not at the time there
were people who were honored at the time
centuries later they're called false
prophets centuries later that was that
I'm laughing because that I'm I'm
smiling because that was my next
question how do you think history will
judge you that's up up to history
depends who wins the Jewish history it
depends who wins the battles if you had
taken the other path in 19 in the 1950s
and stay in
Israel where would you think we would
find you I would be with my friends in
Israel who say the same thing and you
can read them in the Press every day and
if you wouldn't live in the states where
would you live if I wouldn't anywhere
else five years ago you were asked the
question I was asked the question in a
in an interview in har and I said well
I'd certainly go to Israel but uh now I
wouldn't say that it's changed in the
last few years it's changed in ways
which are extremely harmful to the
country you can see it harming itself
day after day it's it's undertake it's
in a mood of not the whole country but
leading sectors including the government
are in a mood of paranoia and
irrationality which is harming the
country very seriously I mean you know
my own case is so trivial it doesn't
matter but just take this trivial case
if the ministry of interior had not
refused entry and I'd gone to give it we
would have end of it nobody would ever
heard of it just as nobody heard of
other talks I've given in bade but
that's minor on the other hand purposely
humiliating the Turkish Ambassador
that's not minor take say the reaction
of the Goldstone report which is quite
interesting uh Israel has turned it into
an international incident if Israel had
acted rationally they would have
responded to the Goldstone report by
saying thank you Mr Goldstone for your
careful work uh thank you particularly
for giving us a great gift as he did if
you're concerned about the safety of
Israel should be concerned about these
matters because in case after case the
irrationality and the paranoia is very
harmful and destructive and in the long
term it could be lead to very serious
consequences professori thank you very
much
