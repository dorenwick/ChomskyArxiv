MICHAEL LEHAVI: We
are set to begin,
so do you want to
take it away, Joseph?
JOSEPH JUNG: Yeah.
Hello, everyone.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for joining us today.
And thank you to Harvard
Law School, particularly
section 5 of the JD class
of 2023, for hosting
this conversation today
with Professor Noam
Chomsky, to whom we
are the most grateful
for his generous giving of time.
Today's event will
begin as a conversation
between Professor Chomsky and
our moderator, Michael Lehavi.
We will save some time
for audience questions,
at which point you may use the
raise hand function for Michael
to call on you, or
you may also privately
message Michael your questions
at any point during the event.
So without further ado, I'll
turn it over to Michael.
MICHAEL LEHAVI:
Thank you, Joseph.
I want to reiterate Joseph's
thanks to Professor Chomsky
for generously donating
his time to us.
I want to thank Joseph
Jung for organizing
this, along with section 5
and the section 5 committee.
For advisement and
preparation for the talk,
I want to thank HLS professors
Richard Lazarus and Kenneth
Mack, as well as professors
and faculty elsewhere,
[? Christiane ?]
[? Leon, ?] William Ramsey,
James Woodbridge, [? Jesse ?]
[? Fitz, ?] [? Yasmin ?]
[? Osagie, ?] Neil [INAUDIBLE],,
and Greg [? Jansen. ?]
It's impossible to provide
an adequate introduction
for Professor Noam Chomsky.
He's the institute
professor and professor
of linguistics emeritus at
MIT and laureate professor
of linguistics, as well
as Agnese Nelms Haury
chair at ASU.
The word profound is
simply insufficient.
He is the most quoted
author alive today.
By 40, he revolutionized
linguistics
and is widely recognized as
the most important linguist
to have ever lived.
He is the preeminent champion
of rationalism and originator
of contemporary
cognitive science
and a central figure
in analytic philosophy.
Alongside incredible
contributions to the sciences
and humanities,
Professor Chomsky
has been a lifelong
activist, and incredibly,
is perhaps better
known for his activism
than his groundbreaking
contributions to the sciences.
A running joke that captures a
fraction of the esteem people
hold for Professor Chomsky is
that he is one of five that
have ever read Bertrand
Russell and Alfred Whitehead's
Principia Mathematica
cover to cover.
Professor Chomsky, thank
you for being here with us.
NOAM CHOMSKY: Glad
to be with you.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: So
to start this off,
earlier this year, you
admitted that while engaged
in discussions of the sort we're
having now, a part of your mind
is occupied by
problems that are more
intellectually stimulating.
To provide those in
the audience less
familiar with your technical
work some sense of it,
what are those problems?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Sorry, I
didn't catch the last part.
Could you say it again?
MICHAEL LEHAVI: To provide
those in the audience
less familiar with
your technical work
some sense of it--
NOAM CHOMSKY: Oh, that would--
MICHAEL LEHAVI: --what
are those problems?
NOAM CHOMSKY: --take a
couple hours to describe,
but you just took me from
the middle of a long article
on new technical
work to try to extend
what's called the minimalist
program, which is an effort
to provide genuine explanations
for linguistic phenomena
by reducing them to elements
so elementary that they satisfy
conditions of evolvability
and learnability, which
are very narrow and strict
empirical conditions.
So it's basically
trying to show that,
to put it fancifully, that
mother nature designed language
as a perfect system for
expression of thought--
not very good for communication.
That was not a consideration.
But it's very well designed
for expression of thought.
And it may, in fact,
constitute thought--
traditional view-- which is not
implausible, which if correct,
means that people like you are
the only organisms with thought
in the entire history
of life, and maybe
in the entire universe.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: OK,
thank you for that.
Given our abundance
of time, I thought I'd
ease into the social issues.
We're in a period of
brinksmanship, socially,
environmentally, and militarily.
Do you see hope for
the world today?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well,
the hope for the world
actually lies in the
hands of people like you.
We happen to be in a very
unusual moment of history,
in fact, unique
moment of history.
We're in the midst of
a confluence of crises
of a kind that have
never occurred before,
and unless they are solved
will never occur again,
because unless they are dealt
with quickly and effectively,
there will be no
further human history.
This may be coming to a close.
The crucial point is with
every one of these crises--
environmental catastrophe,
increasing threat
of nuclear war,
severe deterioration
of democratic functioning
and democratic societies
or quasi-democratic societies,
pandemics, probably other ones
coming.
For all of these
problems and many others,
there are solutions.
And we know the solutions,
and they're feasible.
But it's not enough
to have knowledge.
You have to put it into effect.
And unless that's done
and done pretty quickly,
we're basically toast.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: You
have an acute awareness
of the grave problems we
face today and our failures
to address those problems.
That notwithstanding,
you constantly
express levels of optimism
regarding humanity's capacity
to correct course.
That course correction
requires recognition
of the dire problems we face.
Are you at all concerned that
in a war between bullshit
in the technical
Frankfurt sense espoused
by the self-interested and
reason, bullshit will win out?
NOAM CHOMSKY: I didn't
hear the last part.
Can you say the last part again.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Are
you at all concerned
that in a battle
between bullshit
in the technical Frankfurt
science and reason,
bullshit will win the day?
NOAM CHOMSKY: It's
the same story.
The question is in your hands.
There's no way of predicting.
These are matters of choice.
You can succumb to it.
You can struggle against it.
And the outcome of that there's
never any way of predicting.
But the point is we have
the means to overcome
these destructive tendencies.
And then comes the
question, are you
willing to engage in
ensuring that those means are
implemented expeditiously
in a way which
will lead to prospects for
continuing the human experiment
instead of terminating it?
And again, I think
it's worth stressing
that you are, in fact, the first
generation in human history
who has ever had to
face this question,
and you're also
probably the last,
because if it isn't
solved in your lifetimes,
the future is extremely dim.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: In
Manufacturing Consent,
you explained how elites use
mass media to get the public
to embrace bad leadership and
disastrous foreign policy.
Today, it seems that certain
elites are using similar tools
to manufacture dissent, that
is, create illegitimate distrust
and hostility toward those
very same power sources,
for example,
intelligence sources
that you warned us about.
Have we come full circle
from abusing media
to create too much trust in
institutions to abusing media
to create too much
distrust in institutions,
and what do you make of that?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, actually,
distrust in institutions
is very deep.
It goes back very
far, often justified.
It's been exacerbated
by what's been
happening in the past 40 years.
And remember that we have had
40 years of a neoliberal assault
on the general population.
It began in the
late '70s, escalated
with Reagan and
Thatcher, and thanks
to US-British influence, pretty
much spread around the world.
And that's had very
definite effects.
And one of the effects,
well, just be concrete,
there was a recent study
by the Rand Corporation
trying to estimate how
much wealth was transferred
from working people
and the middle class,
in their measure, the lower
90% of the population, how much
wealth was transferred
by them to extreme wealth
during the past 40 years?
Now, their estimate
is about $50 trillion.
And that shows up
in people's lives.
Take a look at the Bureau
of Labor Statistics
figures on, say,
manufacturing and you'll
find that until 1979,
manufacturing employment
increased from 1979
until the present.
It's declined, particularly
after the impact
of the so-called Free
Trade Agreements,
which have very little to do
with free trade or even trade,
but are investor rights
agreements, which are designed
to set working people in
competition with one another
around the world.
Well, investment is protected
by highly protectionist laws
that never existed before.
And of course, that has an
effect, an obvious effect.
So by now 0.1% of
the population have
doubled their share of
the country's wealth
since 1980, from 10% to 20%.
For much of the
population, large majority,
it's been in
stagnation, decline.
It's gotten so extreme
in the United States
that we now have a decline
in life expectancy, which
is unheard of in
developed societies,
except in the case
of war or pestilence.
Deaths of despair, as
economists call them.
People in the mostly
white working class
who've just given up.
They're not in the
statistics, they just die.
There's nothing for them.
Well, all of this
has led to, not just
in the United States, many
other, Europe and elsewhere,
to a lot of natural
resentment, anger,
contempt for institutions.
Throughout the Western world,
the centrist political parties
have significantly declined.
It's happened here too.
Here they keep the names, in
Europe they change the names.
But pretty similar
around much of the world.
And one aspect of this is that
this ressentiment, as Nietzsche
called it, just anger,
unfocused resentment,
is a perfect terrain
for demagogues.
They can come and
say, I'm your savior,
trust me, follow me, meanwhile
stabbing you in the back.
That's what we've been living
with for the next four years,
and we'll probably live with
for the coming four years,
no matter who happens to
be in the Oval Office.
President Trump is, in my
view, the worst criminal
in human history.
Not just because of
his climate policies,
there's plenty
more to talk about,
but there's no way
to get rid of him.
He has succeeded brilliantly in
tapping poisonous currents that
lie right below the
surface in American life,
bringing them out
to the surface.
They fit the atmosphere
of resentment and anger.
And he has also
tapped currents that
are real in a very
destructive way,
but he's done it successfully.
And people who realize
that the policies that
have been pursued in the last
40 years are destroying them.
Rural America is
being devastated.
Working class areas are
undermined seriously.
That's all real.
And Trump has been able to stand
up and say, I'm your savior,
while at the same time doing
everything imaginable to harm
them and destroy them.
Managed to carry off both things
very, in a way, brilliant,
confidence, and performance.
But with some basis in reality.
Have to face that the
political opposition over him
offered no alternative.
The Democratic Party has
simply pretty much abandoned
the working class in the 1970s.
The last shot of any indication
of support for working people
was the Humphrey-Hawkins
Full Employment
Act in 1978, which
Carter didn't veto,
but he watered it down so that
it was essentially meaningless,
just words.
And since then the Democrats
have just followed along
with the war against the
working class and much
of the middle class.
Obama was an interesting case.
You can read his
memoirs now, which
give a very prettified
picture of what happened.
But what actually happened, and
working people in Massachusetts
grasped it very quickly.
I was living in
Massachusetts then.
Obama at once betrayed
working people instantly.
He was elected in 2008,
lots of enthusiasm,
wonderful person has come.
We can put our faith in him.
Working people voted for him.
We're going to have change.
It will all be great.
First thing he did was
stabbed them in the back.
He had Congress, remember
both the Senate and the House
were Democrat run.
But within two years he had
created the basis for Trump,
very straightforwardly.
Now, the country
was, in that time,
as you recall or at
your age you have heard,
there was the housing
bubble had collapsed.
It brought with it
a financial crisis.
It began under the
second Bush, but it was
raging when Obama took over.
He took over the Bush
programs, the TARP program,
which had two elements.
One of it was bailout
the criminals who
created the crisis, the
banks who had carried out
predatory lending,
subprime mortgages,
complex financial instruments,
derivatives to make sure nobody
knew who owned what.
Building up a huge bubble,
collapsed, was their crime,
they have to be bailed out.
That part was taken for granted.
So they were all adequately
compensated for their crimes.
There was another part
to the TARP legislation.
Do something for their
victims, the people whose
homes were foreclosed,
whose lives were destroyed,
and do something for them.
That was never implemented.
And the other memoirs that
are beginning to come out
indicate that it was
apparently just ridiculed
in the few discussions about it.
But without knowing what was
going on in the White House,
working people could
see what was happening.
In Massachusetts in 2010
there was, by election,
to replace Ted Kennedy,
who had just died.
It was won by a
Republican, Scott
Brown, a known Republican.
If you look at the
voting statistics,
lots of union workers
either didn't bother voting
or voted Republican.
They had just seen
what had happened.
It's not really
the case that Trump
picked up the working class.
The Democrats gave it away.
They lost it.
And they haven't done
anything since to change that.
So that's the kind of
situation we're in.
Yes, plenty of anger, plenty
of contempt for institutions,
has a basis in 40
years of policy.
It came as no surprise.
You go back to 1980, it
was perfectly evident what
was going to happen.
Just think about
it for a minute.
Ronald Reagan came
in and the lines
he was told to read in his
inaugural address said,
government is the
problem, not the solution.
Well, there are decisions
made at a national level that
aren't made by government,
they don't go away.
They're made by someone else.
Yes, they're transferred
into the hands
of private power, unaccountable
private concentrations
of power, corporate sector.
That's where the decisions go.
And they received instructions
from the economic guru
of the neoliberal
movement, Milton Friedman.
Wrote a famous article
in 1981, I think it was.
And it was a very
influential article
in which he explained that the
responsibility of a corporation
is solely self-enrichment.
No responsibility
to stakeholders.
The taxpayer, the public, grants
corporations special rights.
That's why people incorporate
instead of being a partnership.
They're granted special
rights by the public.
But according to the
Friedman neoliberal doctrine,
they have no responsibilities.
And just put it together.
Decisions are taken from
the public domain, put
into private hands,
the sole responsibility
of those private hands
is to enrich themselves.
Does it take a genius to
predict what's going to happen?
Hardly.
Now, we see the effects
of it after 40 years.
I should say that this 50--
47 to be precise--
$47 trillion giveaway
to the wealthy
from the general population
is a vast understatement.
If you look more
closely, you'll see
that the Reaganites
had quickly changed
many administrative procedures,
even laws, which opened
the spigots to massive robbery.
Tax havens, shell companies
were all illegal up to 1980.
And the Treasury Department
enforced the laws.
It was really working.
The IRS existed.
They enforced the laws.
Reagan opened it, it's all open.
What does that mean?
Well, it means, for example,
that the world's biggest
corporation, Apple, doesn't
have to bother paying taxes.
Now they have an office in
Ireland somewhere, which
is probably about the size
of the room I'm talking in,
which a secretary may show
up every once in a while
to shuffle some papers.
But they're an
Irish corporation,
so they don't have to pay
taxes thanks to Ronald Reagan.
It's sheer robbery
of the public.
And it's at the level of
tens of trillions of dollars.
Nobody can really estimate
it, because the only evidence
comes basically from leaks,
like the Panama Papers.
Congress could investigate,
but in order to investigate
they have to want to.
And they're on
the same payrolls,
so they don't want
to investigate.
There's nothing like,
say, the Church Committee
or anything like that anymore.
In fact, Congress
doesn't even want
to know simple data about
what's happening in the world.
Congress had a Office of
Technology Assessment, which
provided independent scientific
analysis on major issues,
like NAFTA for
example, to which they
were very strongly
opposed for good reasons
that they developed.
Congress just dismantled them.
That was the 1990s.
That's not Trump.
Trump, of course, has tried
to throw all science out
of the government.
But it has deeper roots.
So there are plenty of issues.
And that's the background
to your question.
Doesn't come out of nowhere.
Yes, there is contempt
for institutions,
and with pretty good reason.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Thank you for
that brilliant explanation
of the structural problems
that we face today.
Moving from problems to
solutions for a better
tomorrow, you've said
in several interviews
that responsibility to society
is a function of opportunity.
More opportunity equals
more responsibility.
This Zoom is filled
with people that
have tremendous
opportunity, but also face
a series of perverse incentives
that distract and dissuade
from accepting social
responsibility.
How do you suggest
people in this Zoom call,
and those similarly situated,
navigate that landscape?
NOAM CHOMSKY:
That's nothing new.
There have always been
powerful incentives
to be a successful criminal,
an exploiter, a slave
owner, an aggressor who can
steal other people's resources.
You can gain a lot that
way, and what's more,
you get into positions of power.
But there also have been people
who said, we don't want that.
We care about the common good.
We care about other people.
We're going to work for them.
And there's a struggle
all through history
that shows that conflict
in one way or another.
So go back to some of our oldest
records, or say the Bible.
You go back to the
Bible, there was a class
of people called prophets.
You read about them
in Sunday school.
And you say, how nice.
But if you think
about it, the prophets
were kind of what we would now
call dissident intellectuals.
They were people condemning
the crimes of the evil kings,
warning about giving
geopolitical analysis,
warning about what their
policies would lead to,
the destructive policies,
calling for mercy
for the widows and orphans.
That's basically the
message of the prophets.
Not entirely, but
the core message.
How were they treated?
Put in prison, driven
into the desert,
condemned, and ridiculed.
There were also people called--
who were centuries later
were called false prophets.
The flatterers at the court,
now they were doing fine.
You go back many
centuries later,
the values were reversed.
You honor the prophets and
condemn the false prophets.
But that pattern
persists through history,
right until today.
Today we have
different terms for it.
The false prophets
call themselves
technocratic and
meritocratic intellectuals,
or some name like that.
They're the ones
who, as Kissinger
once put it,
articulate the views
and ideas of people with power.
Now, they're doing fine.
There are also critics
and dissidents.
They're not doing so fine.
Depends on the
society, but in one
way or another
almost every society
has some way of
either marginalizing
them, or just killing them, or
imprisoning and torturing them.
OK, that's pretty natural.
That's what you'd expect on
the basis of the incentive
structures you describe.
We see it all through history.
So for example, take
the term intellectual.
It gained its modern usage
in the late 19th century
at the Dreyfus trial in France.
The Dreyfusards
were the first ones
who were called intellectuals
in the modern sense.
Emile Zola, the most
famous, and others.
Today, we respect and
honor the Dreyfusards.
Not in their day, they
were bitterly attacked.
Emile Zola had to
flee for his life, had
to flee from France to England.
The immortals, the
Académie Francaise,
the major intellectual
power center,
bitterly denounced the
Dreyfusards as people who were
daring to criticize our
wonderful institutions,
the courts, the army, and so on.
They were what, in 1968, former
Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy
called wild men in the wings.
He had been the Johnson, Kennedy
national security advisor.
He wrote an important article
in foreign affairs in 1968--
that's the peak of
the peace movement--
in which he distinguished
responsible, serious
intellectuals who may
criticize our tactics,
but don't go beyond that.
And then there are the wild men
in the wings, me for example,
who are daring to criticize the
policies, what they were aimed
at, and the motives, and look
at the internal documents
and see what they were planning.
Those are wild men in the wings.
Just as all through history, you
can see the same things today.
So how about you?
You can take your choice.
You can be a wild man
in the wings, work
for the common good, or you
can accept the incentives
and become a rich,
corporate lawyer.
You've got the choice.
MICHAEL LEHAVI:
Thank you for that.
Moving on, and I want
to remind the audience
to begin raising their hands
for the Q&A session that's
coming up shortly.
But moving on, as it pertains
to political matters and matters
of scientific
import, what do you
view as the correct degree
of epistemic humility?
And are you at
all concerned that
irrational epistemic
confidence that
stems from ignorance of
fallibility advantage
the unreasonable in
terms of persuasion
or effective
rhetoric, which I know
are not your favorite
ways to think
about the issues of the world?
NOAM CHOMSKY: I think,
in principle, we
all agree on the answer.
We should have a reasoned
deliberation, attention
to evidence, a
rational discourse,
a recognition of the
legitimacy of disagreement,
working together to
try to overcome it.
That's pretty much the case
of the sciences, especially
the hard sciences.
Not perfect by any means.
You can find serious flaws,
but it's basically the guiding
ethic of the sciences.
When there are deviations
from it, they are criticized.
They persist.
You can find cases of scientific
malfeasance, falsification
of experiments, unfair
criticisms, so on.
But by and large
it's the margins.
The basic thrust of
the main sciences
is you've got to pay
attention to evidence
and rational argument.
And in the sciences
you can't get
away for very long
with not doing that
or you'll be exposed.
Well, as you move to
other disciplines,
the rigor, the discipline
that's imposed by the facts
of the world is lessened.
We understand less,
power interests
have a greater effect.
So you get more of what
you've just been describing.
But there's no
reason to accept it.
We should insist on it.
And it's a very live issue.
Take right now.
Let's take the least of the
major crises that we face.
There are many.
The least of them
is the pandemic.
We will emerge from the pandemic
at terrible cost, needless
cost.
As we can see from the
examples of countries
that have paid attention,
had some concern
for their own populations,
and overcame it.
And sometimes in pretty amazing
ways all around the world.
There are some who totally
failed, like the United States,
one of the worst.
But it's not from not
knowing what to do.
You knew what to do, some
followed it, some didn't.
If we look at what happened
in the United States,
it's very instructive and
it's important for the future.
When we finally
overcome the pandemic,
we will be facing a situation
very much like 2003.
In 2003, there was a major
coronavirus epidemic, SARS
epidemic, that was contained.
Scientists at once
pointed out there
are going to be other
coronavirus epidemics.
Could be more serious
than this one.
Here's what you
have to do to deal
with it, to get ready for it.
They're saying the
same thing today.
They're saying when we
get out of this one,
there are others coming.
Very likely to be worse.
Here's what you have
to do to get out of it.
Same instructions.
Well, what happened in 2003?
The knowledge was
basically there,
the ideas about what
to do are there,
but somebody has to pick up
the ball and run with it.
Who will it be?
Same questions are arising now.
It could be the
major drug companies.
They have huge laboratories,
wonderful resources,
profit coming out
of their ears thanks
to the highly protectionist,
anti-free trade free trade
agreements.
Everything ready except one
thing, capitalist logic.
Capitalist logic says,
you don't waste money
on something you might make
a little profit from 10
years from now, even though
it might save the population
from destruction.
That's not capitalist logic.
Capitalist logic is
make profit tomorrow.
So the drug companies were
out, they didn't do anything,
There's the government.
Government has
great laboratories.
And actually, most
of the basic research
that's done for
vaccines and drugs
is done in the
public sector anyway.
We have laws which require
that though the basic research
and the risky steps are
taken at public expense,
the public is not allowed
to share in the profits.
Once the work is done, you hand
it over to private tyrannies.
They do the marketing and make
the profit, and of course, fix
up the product a little bit.
That works in every domain.
Your computer, for
example, or drugs.
But including, say, the
Moderna vaccine, basic research
all came out of
government sponsored work.
But the people are not going
to make a profit from that.
The executives at Moderna will.
That's our social
and political system.
Well, the government
could have stepped in,
but there's a
barrier to that too.
It's called neoliberalism.
Government is the
problem, not the solution.
So the government
didn't step in,
so therefore, basically,
nobody picked up the ball.
Well, there were things
that you could do.
When Obama came into office,
2009, first thing he did
was call a meeting of the
Presidential Scientific
Advisory Council.
And he asked them to prepare
a Pandemic Response Program.
They came back in a couple of
weeks and it was implemented.
The Obama administration
did implement the program.
There were also programs of
American scientists working
in China to try to identify
potential coronaviruses,
find out about their
characteristics,
get ready in case one of them
crosses from animal to human,
leads to an epidemic.
Now, that went on
through the Obama years,
until January 2017.
President Trump was elected.
First thing he did,
first days in office,
was dismantle the Pandemic
Response Program, totally.
Next couple of years
moved to kill the programs
with American scientists working
in China, get rid of them.
Next step, actually
from the beginning,
defund the Center
for Disease Control.
And in fact, all health
related aspects of government.
That went on year after
year, every budget.
Congress sometimes overrode it,
but the budget from the White
House is defend--
defund and destroy
everything that
might protect the population.
The last time this
happened was February 2020.
Pandemic is already
raging, Trump's budget
says defund the
Center for Disease
Control and other health
related elements of government.
We will probably find the
same thing next February.
As you know, of course,
the administration
has not conceded the election.
They are acting as if they will
be the next administration.
And one of the things
they're planning
to do is, they have
said, is come out
with a budget for next year.
Probably more of the same.
Well, different
countries reacted--
then, of course, once
the pandemic struck,
countries just
reacted differently.
Some of them, like the countries
of East Asia, South Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Oceania,
New Zealand, Australia, Africa,
which did quite a good job,
they moved very quickly
to try to contain it.
One of the most amazing
cases is Vietnam.
Very poor country, right on
the border of South China,
center of the epidemic.
Had no cases for a
couple of months.
Half a dozen, a handful
now from visitors.
Even countries like Senegal,
Kenya, others managed.
Europe, sort of
dithered, not great,
but they finally got their
act more or less together.
There's a few countries who
are just off the spectrum,
the United States
is one of them.
One disaster after another.
By now the government has
said, we've just given up,
we can't control it.
It's in the hands of
states, localities.
And my own frank suspicion
is that the lame duck
administration is
perfectly happy with this.
If the country becomes
really ungovernable,
in a rotten state,
they're in good shape.
If Biden takes office, he'll
have plenty of problems.
This will make it worse.
The inevitable
failures can be blamed
on the new administration.
The other administration
in Mar-A-Lago,
which will have
Mitch McConnell's
Senate in its pocket
and will call themselves
the real government,
not the fake government,
they can exploit all
this, come roaring back
in '22, 2022 and 2024.
I think that's
what's being planned.
And it'll be with the help of
the legal profession, which
is one of McConnell's only--
the Senate used to be
a deliberative body.
You look at recent years,
it's not a deliberative body.
It doesn't take
proposals from the House
and try to work on them.
It does two things.
One, pass laws that will enrich
the super rich and hit everyone
else in the head, like
the tax scam, 2017.
The other is staff the
judiciary top to bottom
with young, ultra
right lawyers who'll
be able to block anything
for a generation.
So no matter what
the public wants,
these ultra reactionary
policies can persist.
That seems to be the
plan that's developing.
Well, you don't
have to accept it.
But going back to
the pandemic again,
we have the same choices now.
Very likely there are
other pandemics coming.
So far we've been lucky.
Every coronavirus
epidemic has either
been highly contagious
and not too lethal,
like the current one, or highly
lethal, but not too contagious,
like Ebola.
Who says the next one is
going to be that lucky?
Maybe it will be both.
Plus it'll all be exacerbated
by global warming and habitat
destruction.
So we can anticipate a
much more serious pandemic,
and we can do
something about it.
We can take the advice
that was there in 2003.
That means we have to
overcome capitalist logic,
the neoliberal assault, and
the malevolence of government
figures.
That's the three problems.
It can all be done.
It's not going to happen
unless people do it.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Thank
you, Professor Chomsky.
Transitioning now
to audience Q&A,
I'm going to call
Anna Bintinger.
You should be able to unmute.
ANNA BINTINGER: Hi, Professor.
Thank you for talking to us.
Moving back to the subject
of the first question,
as somebody who fell in love
with linguistics in college,
really in large part
to do with your work,
I would just love to hear why
you chose to study linguistics
in the first place?
And then what keeps
you studying it?
NOAM CHOMSKY: I'm sorry,
I couldn't catch it.
Could you repeat, Michael?
MICHAEL LEHAVI: I
believe Anna said
that she studied linguistics
and fell in love with it,
and fell in love with it
through your work, and--
NOAM CHOMSKY: Congratulations.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: --she was
wondering why you fell in love
with linguistics to start.
NOAM CHOMSKY: Why I personally?
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Yes.
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I'm
interested in human beings.
Let's go back to the
first thing I said.
There's some pretty amazing
things about human beings.
Now, almost all of them
derive from the fact
that we have language.
One amazing thing is
that we have thoughts.
I have two lovable canines--
I can't use the word or there
will be a rush to the door--
under my desk.
They don't have thoughts.
They have things in mind,
like half a dozen of them.
But they don't have anything
like thoughts in the sense
that humans do, that can
be articulated as beliefs,
arguments, expectations,
plans, and so on.
That's just not there.
And the same is true
of every organism
that we know, including
our closest relatives,
the great apes.
Even with very intensive
efforts at training,
they can't pick up the basic,
most elementary rudiments
of language.
It's not because of any sensory
motor deprivation, same as us.
But they just don't
have whatever's inside.
So in fact, there have been--
in the roughly four billion
years of life on Earth,
there have been about
50 billion species.
There's one that
can have thoughts.
And those thoughts
are based on the fact
that we have this amazing
capacity for language.
As I said before, this might be
the only one in the universe.
The grand old man
of American biology,
Harvard biologist
Ernst Meyer, once
pointed out that if you look
at the one example we have,
life on Earth, turns out
that the successful species,
the ones that are
biologically successful,
that proliferate and survive,
are pretty much the dumb ones.
The bacteria, the insects,
the beetles, they do fine.
As you move up the scale of
what we call intelligence,
there's fewer and fewer of them,
and they don't last very long.
In fact, up until very recently
there weren't very many humans.
It's only roughly the
last 10,000 years.
Well, there's this one species.
And he suggests that this--
he says, there's plenty of
planets all over the universe.
There is something
which you may have
heard called Fermi's paradox.
The great physicist,
Fermi, wondered
why, with all of the
huge numbers of planets
in the universe that are
very much like ours, how come
we can't find any signs
of intelligent life?
And Meyer's suggestion
is there isn't any.
It's better to be stupid
than smart, basically.
The chances of higher
intelligence developing
are slight.
And if it does develop, it
may be a lethal mutation.
He didn't go on to say it,
but now I'll add something.
We are in the midst
of trying to show
that it is a lethal mutation.
We're in the midst of acting
in ways which will destroy life
on Earth, and are
already doing it
on a massive scale with
the sixth extinction.
Anyhow, all of these unique
properties, maybe alone
in the history of the
universe, are based
on the existence of language.
So I think it's a
fascinating thing
to study if you
want to understand
not only humans, but
something about the nature
of the universe.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Thank you
for that, Professor Chomsky.
That was fantastic.
Moving to our next question.
Andrew Santana,
you should now have
the ability to unmute yourself.
ANDREW SANTANA: Hello,
Professor Chomsky,
thank you so much for your time.
My question is, how do we
overcome the algorithms that
dictate our public discourse
when those algorithms have been
designed with capitalist logic?
How do we break
the vicious cycle
to achieve rational,
democratic discourse?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Very
simple, by doing it.
Don't be overwhelmed
by the algorithms.
Sounds fancy and
scientific, but it's just
sharpening ways of
control and domination
that have existed
through the ages.
And it's not making
that much of a change.
And you resist it the
way you always did.
In societies that are
really harsh and brutal,
it's a rough go.
If you're living in China, let's
say, or Saudi Arabia, or Iran,
it's not easy to
get up and say, I'm
going to challenge
existing authority.
Some do it, like Ai Weiwei
in China, and others,
but not very easy.
If you live in a society like
ours, it's not that hard.
If you're like us,
privileged, all of us,
then you're pretty
well protected.
You're not going
to be shot, you're
not going to be tortured.
Maybe you'll be called
a wild man in the wings,
maybe you won't be able
to get the job you want,
and maybe you'll be excluded
from National Public Radio,
as I am, for example.
But it's not the
end of the world.
There's a lot of
things you can do
and there's a lot of
gratification in doing them.
So for privileged people like
us, plenty of opportunities.
You don't get the
amenities that you
will get if you join the
persecuting class anymore
than throughout
history, but that
doesn't mean you can't do it.
So I'd say, forget
the algorithms,
forget the repression,
just move ahead.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Thank you.
I just want to confirm that
is 3:00 a hard stop for you,
Professor Chomsky?
There's many people that are
interested in asking questions.
I just want to make sure in
terms of these last few minutes
how to use the time.
Is 3:00 a hard stop?
Professor Chomsky?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah,
that's fine, let's go on.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: OK.
Kevin Vasquez.
KEVIN VAZQUEZ: Thanks, Michael.
And hi, Professor Chomsky.
First I want to say, I'm a
huge admirer of your work.
I've read dozens of your books
and they've totally transformed
the way I look at the world.
And so it's really an honor to
meet you and to listen to you.
But my question is something
that I struggle with a lot
and that I talk to a lot with
people, and it's sort of basic.
But this year, and for the
last half decade at least,
we've seen these huge
movements for racial justice
popping up and developing.
And I think a lot of times
these movements are divorced--
they're about
representation and they're
divorced from critiques of
corporate power, or capitalism,
or inequality, or poverty, or
so many of the other things
that you've talked about today.
And for that reason,
it seems to me
like they're almost acceptable
to the neoliberal power
structure, because they're
about basically maybe changing
who's in the
corporate boardroom,
but not changing the fact that
the corporate boardroom exists.
So my question to you
is, to what extent
do you think these movements
about racial injustice
are helpful to us on the left?
And to what extent
do you think we
need class-based,
broad politics that
talks about economic
issues, corporate power,
and political
corruption, and things
that appeal to working class
people of all different races?
NOAM CHOMSKY: So let's take the
major social movement that's
just emerged,
Black Lives Matter.
It's a very striking
development.
We learn a lot from it.
There was a lot of
organizing that went on
for years, laid the
background for what
happened after the Floyd
murder, didn't just
come out of nowhere.
But there was an amazing
development right
after the Floyd murder.
Within days the biggest social
movement in American history
emerged.
A huge social movement,
lots of participation.
Black-white solidarity.
Enormous public support,
unprecedented public support,
was about 2/3 support.
That's way higher than what
Martin Luther King received
at the peak of his popularity.
And it wasn't just here.
It was elsewhere too.
Well, that came
out of a background
of activism and organizing.
Then comes the aftermath.
What tactics do you use?
That makes a big
difference, big difference.
Let's take the slogans that
came out of the movement,
like "defund the police."
Well, if you want to
achieve something, anyone
who wants to be an
activist, you have
to ask yourself, how can
I formulate my proposals
and demands and
policies in a way which
will lead to public
understanding and support?
Or shall I just formulate
them to make me feel good
and alienate people?
That's a choice that
happens all the time.
Choice between feel good
tactics and do good tactics.
And in the case of Black
Lives Matter, you saw both.
The feel good tactic,
which was a major gift
to President Trump
and the far right,
was just say, get
rid of the police,
get them out of
our neighborhoods.
Nobody's going to accept that.
It's just not in this world.
Maybe you can imagine a
different world, but not
this one.
There was actually a
very sensible version
of defund the police, which
the main activists in Black
Lives Matter formulated,
which was pursued by people
like Bernie Sanders,
openly and eloquently,
and saying what defund
the police means
is take away from the
police responsibilities
which they should
never have had.
Like a large majority
of police work
is work that the police are
not trained or equipped to do,
and don't want to do.
Domestic disputes,
mental health problems,
lost dogs, whatever it may be.
Take that away from
the police, put it
in the hands of
community service.
People who do it much
better, and don't have
to walk around with guns
and threatening people.
That will already enormously
defund the police,
and the police are
in favor of it.
Then increase police salaries
so it's a more desirable job.
People will come in
who have concerns
other than just getting by,
better training and so on.
That's a policy of
defund the police
which would be accepted
by a lot of the police,
and maybe even favored
by them, and accepted
by the general community.
Well, which one you
pursue will determine
whether your movement succeeds.
And that's true of every social
movement you can think of.
I've been involved with dozens
of them through my life,
and the problem always comes up.
Take, say, the
Vietnam War protests,
and around 1970,
the main protests
were breaking up
into fracturing,
like Students for a
Democratic Society, one
of the major groups fractured.
One group became Maoists.
They were going to stand
outside the GE factory in Lynn
with copies of a red book and
hand it to the workers and say,
let's have a revolution.
You can guess how far that got.
Friends of mine, incidentally.
Some of them Harvard
professors I should say.
Then another group
became the Weathermen.
Let's break windows
on Main Street
and smash up the society,
that'll bring a revolution.
The Vietnamese were
appalled by this.
I remember meetings with
Vietnamese, pleading
with people to stop this.
It's not helping them at
all, it's harming them.
It's just building up support
for continuing the war.
It just gets people angry.
| they say, OK, let's
destroy the bastards.
And that's how the anti-war
movement largely collapsed.
This happens over and over.
You pick the movement,
look into it closely,
you'll see these
things developing.
Well, those are
decisions you have
to make if you want to be a
serious organizer and activist.
Things that may feel
good don't matter.
Nobody cares if you feel good.
What matters if you
do something that
comes out with a
constructive consequence.
And there are plenty
of things you can do.
Serious organizers all know
this, it's in their blood.
That's the way you work.
But if you join the
movement for excitement,
you say, let's do
something exciting,
let's break some windows,
let's shout Black Lives Matter
in a suburban restaurant, you're
just giving the opposition
a great gift.
One aspect of that is what's
now called cancel culture.
I don't like some speaker and
I don't want them on campus,
I'll keep them off campus.
Wonderful gift to the
speaker, who loves it,
who can then present himself
or herself as a great hero
defending freedom
against the gangsters.
Wonderful gift to the right.
Has no effect on
increasing understanding.
The right way to
respond is to say, OK,
let the speaker come to campus,
let's organize counter meetings
or demonstrations in which
we talk about the issues,
expose what the person is up
to, look into the real issues,
figure out what we
can do with them.
You can turn it into an
educational opportunity,
a basis for activism,
or you can turn it
into a gift to the right.
It's the kind of choice that
people are facing all the time.
And that's true of
every activist movement
I've ever had any contact with.
MICHAEL LEHAVI: Thank
you, Professor Chomsky.
We are now over time.
Thank you for generously
contributing your time to this.
Thank you to the
Section 5 Committee
and Joseph Jung for organizing.
Do you have any
last words that you
think the HLS community needs to
hear before we close the show?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, there's
a very elementary message,
which I've already mentioned
and I'll just repeat.
Your generation is
facing new questions
which have never arisen.
Basically, the question,
will the human experiment
persist in any
recognizable form?
And you're the first generation
to face the question.
You're the last
generation to face it,
unless you answer it with
a positive answer, which
can be done.
We're heading for
disaster on many fronts,
so you have an incredible
responsibility,
but a very exciting challenge.
And I think you
can't ignore that.
MICHAEL LEHAVI:
Professor Chomsky, it
was a thrill and a privilege.
Again, thank you for your time.
This was an
incredible opportunity
for the whole lot of us.
Thank you to the audience.
And I guess that is a wrap.
NOAM CHOMSKY: Thank
you very much.
It's a pleasure to be with you.
