I thought for a moment that the famous
German technology would fail I don't
want that to
happen it's what always happens at
MIT
uh well the question what is special
about language uh covers far too much
ground for me to try to address it
more than very
superficially I'll have to cut lots of
interesting Corners uh I'd like to
concentrate on two approaches to the
question which differ radically in
assumptions uh since the time is brief
I'll have to draw the lines too sharply
but uh not too much to identify some uh
issues that are worth thinking about I
hope uh the two approaches that differ
on whether the announced topic makes any
sense in the first place it's based the
topic is based on several
presuppositions uh one of them is that
language exists that is exists as a uh
an independent object of serious study
and not just an arbitrary collection of
various phenomenon processes as
something like say today's weather which
is there's no science of today's weather
that language exists in a serious sense
it might seem uncontentious but it's
very far from that in fact a major
tendency in contemporary cognitive
science possibly the dominant one uh
holds that it does not exist and
sometimes uh states that uh forcefully
and
explicitly it should be recalled that
there's nothing new in this stance if
you go back about half a century uh it
was widely held by the most prominent
philosophers U linguists and others that
language is just a matter of U
Elementary psychological processes and
some notion of induction or analogy that
was left quite obscure
so for example for WV Quin at Harvard
the most influential philosopher I
suppose in the world concerned with the
general issues uh for him a language is
just um quoting him a fabric of
sentences associated with one another
and with stimuli by the mechanism of
conditioned response and a rather
arbitrary fabric depending on the ACT
accidental course of conditioning which
will differ from one person to
another uh in professional Linguistics a
dominant View at the time was that uh
languages can differ Without Limits
apart from very restricted constraints
maybe some pH phonetic processes
incidentally the same pretty much the
same view was held in biology at the
time about organisms was assumed that
they could differ essentially in
arbitrary ways depending on The
Accidental course of natural
selection uh the it was also widely
assumed in linguistics that linguistic
Theory consists of nothing more than a
collection of uh procedures procedures
of analysis uh to reduce a body of Data
Corpus socalled uh to an organized form
in one or another way depending on one's
particular purposes uh later later
versions of the non-existence hypothesis
uh uh within philosophy were that rules
of language any mental rules can be can
be postulated uh only if they are in
principle accessible to
introspection that's a Dogma with a long
history uh incoherent in my opinion when
looked at carefully but but uh even if
it's uh accepted if you adopt it it
excludes almost everything and there are
other variants uh among them the assist
insistence Again by prominent
philosophers that the language must be
regarded as a sociopolitical entity of
some kind hence dependent on continuity
of
Empires colors on maps literary culture
National myths military forces and so on
but at any event nothing that exists
that can be studied uh a corollary in
the mid 20th century and in fact since
is that there are no real problems to
solve in the study of language apart
from accumulation and organization of
data uh something like what viken Stein
called an assembly of
particulars uh with the computer age
coming into Focus back about in the
1950s uh many leading figures held that
since the only real object is some kind
of a corpus of
data uh automat automation of generally
uh accepted procedures and statistical
analysis of data should yield everything
relevant about the
language uh well the announced topic
today uh presupposes the existence of
language
but it also presupposes the existence of
other cognitive
facilities so it essentially takes the
mind to be much like the rest of the
organism a complex of
subsystems often informally called
organs or technically modules uh each
with enough internal Integrity so that
it makes good sense to study each in
abstraction from the others with which
it's integrated in the life for the
organism for example the visual immune
digestive other
organs below the neck metaphorically
speaking and the various mental organs
uh language planning the various
structures of memory U and organization
of action and so on whatever the right
analysis of the Mind turns out to be uh
the cognitive neuroscience
Randy gallistl at rers has observed that
the biological Norm is modular systems
with special growth learning mechanisms
in different domains uh and in different
species and there's every reason I think
to expect human language to keep to the
biological Norm in this respect in fact
very strong reason because there are
crucial features of human language that
appear to be quite isolated in the
biological world and they also seem to
have emerged very recently in
evolutionary time uh many millions of
years after the separation of modern
humans from any other surviving
species well my own assumption is that
language does exist as a module of the
Mind Body mostly the brain but that the
non-existence approach
uh is in part raising the right
questions though pursuing them in a way
that's very likely to fail at least as
failure and success have been understood
uh in the Sciences for many
centuries the study of evolution of
language is a very Lively topic these
days judging by the number of
Publications that pour out with such
titles and that's rather odd and many
respects uh much simpler questions are
scarcely
investigated uh the evolution of the
communication systems of hundreds of
these species for example is plainly a
far simpler question but it's recognized
by B scientists to be uh much too hard
to say much
about
um in fact very little is known about
evolution of cognition allog together uh
and it's quite possible that nothing
much can be learned at least by any
methods that are currently
understood that's a conclusion that's
been argued
by a very prestigious evolutionary
biologist Richard lanton in well-known
but unfortunately neglected
essays uh a look at the literature on
evolution of language reveals that most
of it scarely scarcely even addresses
the topic instead it offers speculations
about the evolution of communication
which is a very different matter it's
also based on very strange beliefs about
Evolution to some of which I'll briefly
return well to make the discussion
concrete uh let me illustrate with a
recent essay that encapsulates quite
clearly the main assumption of the
Contemporary non-existence approach to
language and its Evolution it's in
Science magazine the science journal of
the American Association for the
advancement of science uh it's a review
article discussing several books on
evolution of language by NJ Enfield of
the MOX plun
Institute uh he finds essentially
nothing of any value in the books that
are reviewed
uh their contents he argues is lethally
Tainted by the existence assumption that
is the belief that there are rule
systems that determine form meaning
relations in language and the conditions
of language use uh to illustrate the
fallacy of the existence approach the
article is accompanied by a photograph
of three infants suitably multi racial
uh apparently noticing each other uh the
caption reads communication without
syntax and the point is to show that
real rule systems of the kind that are
studied under the existence assumption
are not necessary for
communication actually a picture of
three bacteria could have made the same
point uh the title of this article
enfield's article is without social
context
with a question mark the question mark
expresses the
surprise uh at a basic fallacy of the
existence approach it ignores social
context when it seeks to discover the
properties of language so just again to
try to make the matter concrete take one
sentence uh the sentence he wondered
whether the mechanics fixed the cars
simple sentence and consider two
questions that you can ask about it uh
how many cars how many mechanics so the
two interrogative expressions are how
many cars did he wonder whether the
mechanics fixed answer three cars uh how
many mechanics did he wonder whether
fixed the cars answer three mechanics
well the two sentences very clearly
differ in status you can't ask how many
mechanics did he Wonder if fixed the
cars now that's called an island
violation technically it's called an ECP
violation uh we can think the thought to
find thought but to express the thought
requires some more complex paraphrase
well to investigate questions like these
and there are innumerable similar ones
uh according to Enfield and the editors
of science uh we have to consider the
social context of actual normal use of
these
Expressions that inquiry is very quickly
finished uh there's effectively none uh
and it's a mistake to raise the question
in the first place according to this
approach because the sentences are
constructed as an experiment and not
drawn from a massive Corpus of observed
data where you'd never find sentences
like that that is the inquiry proceeds
by the methods of the Sciences since
Antiquity which is considered a serious
flaw the observation about social
context is uncontroversial with regard
to
communication surely the study of
communication must take into account
social context it's also
uncontroversial that the study of the
mechanisms that we put to use typically
ignores social context in all domains
and quite rightly so for example the
class work on neurophysiology of vision
or on object recognition and constancy
or uh Shimon olan's very interesting
study of how minimal stimuli practically
none are interpreted reflexively as
rigid objects in motion or in fact
virtually all the fundamental work that
aims to determine uh the properties of
the modules of cognition at whatever
level of inquiry the uh the study is
conducted the physiological to uh
psychological but we're instructed by
this approach that the study of the
mechanisms involved in the examples that
I mentioned or vowel Harmony in Turkish
or relative scope of operators or in
fact everything else about language must
depart from the scientific
Norm uh the kind of CRI ique that I just
outlined which is quite widespread is
generally accompanied by a novel concept
of science that has emerged in the
cognitive Sciences contemporary
cognitive sciences and related areas of
linguistics uh which has a new notion of
success uh an account of phenomena is
taken to be successful to the extent
that it approximates unanalyzed data
so take say the study of uh
communication of bees uh according to
this conception the way it's generally
conducted by scientists is seriously
flawed uh instead of difficult
experiments devising circumstances that
never occur in nature like say having
bees fly to flowers in an island in a
lake to test whether they're using an
odor Trail instead of doing things like
that and many more complicated ones B
scientists should be carrying out
statistical analysis of uh uh massive
collections of videotapes of bees
swarming uh they would achieve greater
and greater success in approximating the
videotapes and they get a tolerably good
prediction of what's likely to happen
next actually a much better scci
approximation than b scientists could
give or would care about and in fact you
might um revise physics the same way so
throw out the physics department for the
last couple hundred years uh no balls
rolling down frictionless planes which
can't exist in nature and other such
abstractions and idealizations that have
defined the subject for centuries rather
what you should do is extensive
statistical analysis of videotapes of
whatever happening outside the window
say leaves blowing in the wind other
natural events and that'll surely give
more uh successful predictions of what
will happen next outside the window than
what the physics department can provide
now if you look at the major cognitive
science journals and also General
journals like science or nature they
regularly publish articles that are that
triumphantly list dramatic failures
which are called
successes uh and they are successes in
terms of this New Concept which is
unique in the history of Science and
also radically restricted U to language
in fact because the idea is so obviously
observ when you move Beyond uh in fact
uh even to very closely related systems
like say
arithmetic uh you don't study a person's
arithmetical capacity by constructing
models based on statistical analysis of
masses of
observations uh of what when what
happens when people try to multiply
numbers in their heads without external
memory at least I hope nobody
does uh Enfield also puts forth a
far-reaching thesis is quite standard in
the cognitive sciences and a very clear
expression of the non-existence thesis
it is that language is entire ly
grounded in a constellation of cognitive
capacities that each taken separately
has other functions as well which means
that language exists only in the sense
that today's weather exists uh it's a a
constellation of many factors that
operate
independently the examples I mentioned
the ECP examples uh would have to be
like that somehow actually cites a
source to justify the conclusion but it
has almost no relation to the thesis and
it's not because he's chosen badly but
because there are none that do any
better but he's correct in saying that
this is what many probably most
cognitive Sciences
believe uh he presents a closely related
thesis that is also very widely held
namely there are welldeveloped
gradualist evolutionary arguments to
support the conclusion that there's no
thing such thing as language except as a
complex kind of arbitrary complex of
independent cognitive processes again no
relevant source is cited nor does one
exist uh these gradualist evolutionary
claims which are often held to be some
kind of
necessity uh he presents in critique of
what he calls the
salistar sudden jump argument namely
that the transition from finite to
unbounded was not
gradualist that's a strange but very
standard position it's a logical truth
that the transition was saltation you
can't get to unbounded from by small
steps from finite that's just the
logical Truth uh but saltation is is a a
dirty word in many U circles on the
basis of a curious but widespread
misunderstanding of evolutionary biology
perhaps worth exploring but uh uh I I'll
put it aside except from noting that the
saliste heresy if you like is totally
unpro problematic among evolutionary
biologists so for example one recent
book by two prominent evolutionary
biologists that takes as its Central
problem I'm quoting the question how can
small random genetic changes be
converted into complex useful
Innovations gives many examples uh the
leading
paleoanthropologist concludes that the
Innovation that set the stage for
language language acquisition depended
on the phenomenon of emergence whereby a
chance combination of pre-existing
elements results in something totally
unexpected a sudden emergent event
presumably a neural change in some
population of the human lineage rather
minor in genetic terms which probably
had nothing whatsoever to do with
adaptation all quotes this is all
saltationism with a Vengeance at least
if the term is supposed to have any
meaning well although we know very
little about evolution of language there
are few fairly clear conclusions and
they're
suggestive uh there's very good evidence
that the language capacity is the same
for all human groups so for example if
an infant from a remote tribe in the
Amazon jungle is raised in Boston its
language will be that of my
grandchildren and
conversely there are individual
differences but no known group
differences uh it follows that there has
been no meaningful evolutionary change
with regard to language since the the
time when our common ancestors left
Africa uh they're assumed to be a very
small group uh spread around the world
very quickly uh perhaps about 50,000
years ago it's generally surmised if you
go back roughly 50,000 years before that
there's no evidence in the
archaeological record that language
existed at all so somewhere in that
quite narrow window which is a blink of
the eye and evolutionary terms there
seems to have been a sudden explosion of
creative activity complex social
organization a symbolic behavior of
various kinds records of astronomical
events a complex social
organization uh it's it's it's Jared
Diamond biologist called it a Great Leap
Forward it's generally assumed by
paleoanthropologists to be associated
with the emergence of language right in
that
window and since then there appears to
have been no evolutionary change if one
prefers to double or triple the numbers
uh nothing relevant
changes these are quite simple
observations they're reasonably well
supported and they provide some
plausible suggestions about the design
of language which I'll return to briefly
well suppose now that we do assume that
language exists as a object of study and
we want to look at language as a normal
biological system a module of the Mind
Body along side of many others then the
standard
questions arise for any biological
system roughly what how and why
questions so what are the properties of
the acquired languages each considered
now an internal system of an individual
uh how are they Acquired and why do they
have these properties and not other
properties uh well perhaps the most
Elementary property of language and one
which distinguishes it from anything
else known in the biological world uh is
that it consists of a discrete Infinity
of interpretable Expressions kind of
like the natural numbers so there's a
five-word sentence six-word sentence but
no five and a halfword sentence and it
goes on in definitely uh that means that
each speaker has
internalized a what's called a
generative process that yields an
infinite array of hierarchically
structured Expressions which are
interpreted uh at the interfaces to two
other systems the sensory motor system
and what's called the conceptual
intentional system basically thought and
planning of action uh the unbounded
range is a very Elementary fact which
rather interestingly seems to have
received little notice maybe none until
the 17th century Scientific Revolution
where it um it's discussed by Galileo
much more extensively by the cart and it
played a significant role uh any
approach to language that doesn't at
least capture this property just can't
be taken
seriously uh for language or any other
internal module the growth and
development in the individual involves
at least three factors the one factor is
external data the second factor is a
genetic
endowment that converts data to
experience and it guides the general
course of development and third a
principles of broader scope some of them
probably laws of nature which are
invariably a major factor in evolution
and development well for language you
can analyze the genetic endowment into
two factors two parts uh there's a
component that's specific to human
language that's called Universal grammar
it's a modern adaptation of a
traditional term which meant something
else U ug for sure Co and then there are
others that are just relevant to
language development other cognitive
systems and neurophysiological
structures and so on it would seem
likely Prim fascia that ug is critically
involved in determining such phenomena
as the ones uh I mentioned although
third Factor general
principles probably are also crucial uh
but we can explore the role of ug uh in
the very early stages early moments of
language development so it's now known
for example that newborn
infants uh can instantly and reflexively
extricate language relevant data from
the confusion the famous blooming
buzzing confusion around them that's no
trivial task it's apparently a human
specific element of ug impossible for
any other
organism uh and the infant also very
quickly acquires knowledge of the
general it's called prootic system of
the language the pitch and stress
Contours which differ from language to
language but by a couple of months the
child has mastered them and in fact it
seems that in part this is prenatal uh
intrauterine learning because it's all
there at the moment of birth as you can
tell by sophisticated
experiment uh the and the sound system
generally is is known quite quickly a
few months and maybe a lot more uh all
of this is must be dependent on
ug there are some early steps which do
involve other cognitive processes so in
my own work on this topic in the
1950s I took for granted that uh
extraction of words from running text
discourse has to be based on calculation
of transitional prob abilities since
there seem to be no other relevant
evidence but the matter turns out to be
more complex and much more interesting
the very recent work shows that this
method
fails uh though the results improve
sharply when the method interacts with
ug principles so six-month old infants
uh segment running discourse into
elements that have wordlike property
uh they uh whenn High transition
probabilities which uh are aligned with
phrasal prootic
constituents which actually are syntax
related uh and this is all determined by
subtle unconscious and reflexive Pro
processes but whatever it is it's there
by about 6
months U although real results remain
sparse the role of statistics and
statistical reasoning and other
cognitive processes in language
acquisition is potentially a significant
area of research it's something that's
never been in doubt uh there are also
are presumably conditions imposed on
Language by the structure of the brain
although too little is understood about
this to draw any conclusions although
there has been recent progress in
neurolinguistics but not at this level
of fine
detail uh it may be as a again cognitive
neuroscientist Randy gallis argued that
a fundamental
reorientation of centuries of study of
the brain will be necessary to discover
the neural elements that enter into the
computational
capacities not only of human language
but even of insects where they're indeed
astonishing
uh has a recent book on this the uh
study of uh the neural basis for
language raises very special
difficulties well above others precisely
because language is so special so for
example a lot is known about the neural
structure of the human visual
system uh but uh that's learned not from
the study of humans it's studied by
invasive experiment ation
with cats and monkeys rightly or wrongly
we allow ourselves to torture them uh
and from and they have about the same
visual systems as humans melean visual
system seems pretty common uh so by
studying them with invasive
experimentation you do learn something
about the human visual system uh but
there's no way to carry out invasive
experimentation with other organ
organisms in the case of language
because there's nothing analogous
anywhere in the biological world so no
experimentation is
possible uh well let's uh let's turn to
ug Universal grammar the question
whether language exists is basically the
question whether ug exists as I've
mentioned this is commonly denied but I
don't know of any coherent
alternative uh in the early work in the
19 50s it appeared as though ug must be
extremely rich to achieve a degree of
descriptive
adequacy uh one major goal of
theoretical Linguistics since that time
has been to reduce the postulated
complexity of ug in accounting for the
phenomena of language like the one
example I mentioned but the reasons are
perfectly straightforward uh the first
is just standard rational inquiry
seeking to achieve greater explanatory
depth and another reason is the hope
that there might someday be a serious
study of evolution of
language uh evidently this task to the
extent that it's feasible at all is
rendered more difficult to the extent
that the postulated Target ug is more
complex that's obvious the U
non-existence approach shares the same
goal namely to reduce eug G in fact to
reduce it to zero in this case but there
are several sent differences between
these two approaches uh I think it's
fair to say that virtually that there
the first has to do with regard to
results I think it's fair to say that
there are virtually none maybe none at
all in the non-existence literature
except in terms of the Curious notion of
success that I mentioned that's been
contrived at departing from all of
science uh uh in contrast there are
quite substantial results in the
existence literature if you look at them
carefully overwhelmingly over half a
century they result from investigating
third Factor considerations of
computational complexity is sometimes
called sometimes the inquir is phrased
in different words but that's what it
comes down to uh for those of you who
know the literature these steps include
include among other things dissolving
so-called constructions uh
into more General components uh
elimination of phrase structure grammars
total elimination with all their Rich
stipulations uh radical reduction of the
complexity of
transformational uh grammars the kind
that were designed to account somehow
accommodate non-contiguous
relations such as the ubiquitous
phenomenon of of displacement in
language and also morphological
discontinuity uh and finally in more
recent years uh the unification of these
two generative systems under the
simplest possible computational
operation one which functions in some
manner in any computational system
generative system a recent inquiry into
these topics is often called the minim
minimalist program but the term
apparently has misled people it's
actually just ordinary science it
extends the main thrust of theoretical
Linguistics as since the early days of
the Contemporary work in the
1950s and these developments are rather
natural the language is very clearly a
computational system so it makes good
sense to seek the role of general
principles of computational efficiency
that apply far more broadly and probably
are rooted in organism independent
natural law uh this is particularly
natural given the very little we know
about the evolution of language what I
just mentioned uh clearly a generative
system emerged sometime in the very
recent past uh of course in some
individual that's the way mutations take
place they don't take place in groups
perhaps some small rewiring of the brain
well well it should have been as simple
as possible that is the minimal change
from the earlier state by some small
mutation furthermore there were no
selectional pressures at all at that
initial stage so we would therefore
expect this emerging process to be
determined solely by natural law rather
like a snowflake should be
perfect uh and the same should be true
as this change is transmitted to
offspring uh ultimately maybe dominating
a small breeding group and there's
increasing evidence that something like
that may well have been what happened uh
well consider the what questions as soon
as the question was addressed within the
framework of generative grammar about 60
years ago many puzzles came to light
which previously had been unnoticed in
the thousands of years of detail study
of language and some of them are still
on the agenda uh that moment is somewhat
reminiscent of the ear very early modern
Scientific Revolution 17th century uh
for Millennia the scientists had been
satisfied with traditional answers to
simple questions like why does a rock
fall to the ground and steam rise to the
sky uh answer their moving to their
natural place end of discussion uh when
Galileo and others allowed themselves to
be puzzled by such facts as these and to
investigate them incidentally very
quickly refuting conventional beliefs
science modern science began science
entered a new phase now the capacity to
be puzzled by what looks simple is well
worth cultivating history amply reveals
that well of the period puzzles that
arose back in the ' 50s when the first
efforts were made to go beyond resort to
Cally vacuous Notions like analogy
training pattern formation and so on all
left obscure uh of many a huge number of
examples very quickly discovered I'll
just mention two because there they are
probably the only two cases for which
answers have been sought relying on
nonlinguistic cognitive processes as I
mentioned there's a very widely held
belief but there's almost no work
pursuing it uh there are a couple of
cases though to in fact typically they
adopt the non-existence approach well
one very old example has to do with
what's called auxiliary inversion uh so
for example as in the sentence that can
eagles that fly swim simple sentence uh
well we understand that the question is
whether Eagles can swim and not whether
they can fly that is the auxiliary
element can is associated with swim not
fly U that's obvious from the
interpretation uh it's also obvious from
the
morphology uh so you can say uh are
eagles that fly swimming have Eagles
that fly bin swimming which you can't
say are eagles that are flying swim
meaning in this case that
uh that
the the is it the case that the Eagles
that are flying swim perfectly fine
thought but you just can't say it uh
something about the design of language
hampers
communication compels a paraphrase in
this case much like the ECP examples
that I mentioned where a perfectly good
thought can be uh can be held in the
mind but it can't be expressed except in
some roundabout complex way as a result
of something about language
design well this uh the question about
auxiliary inversion or anal many
analoges show up in languages all over
the place that question had never Arisen
in Millennia of careful study of
language it was taken to be obvious like
objects seeing seeking their natural
place but if you you think about it it's
not obvious why should it be the case in
fact ease of computation would suggest
that it should work the other way around
that should suggest that the fronted
auxiliary remember the sentence can
eagles that fly swim that the front the
can that's in the front should be
associated with the closest verb hence
fly not swim now that's a far easier
computational operation than the actual
one which involves imp osing a structure
on the expression now furthermore
communication would be facilitated if
both options were available that would
avoid the need for the complex
paraphrase in one case so putting the
matter differently there are two
concepts of minimal distance which are
competing uh uh one concept is minimal
linear distance how close in the linear
order are two things that would relate
the sentence to Eagles that can fly swim
a minimal structural distance relates it
to Eagles that fly can swim much more
complex computational operation reason
is that Eagles that fly is a phrase so
you get a structural distance giving a
different answer than linear distance
and the question then reduces to why the
language learner reflexively minimizes
the property of structural distance
rather than adopting the computationally
far simpler property of linear distance
or adopting both facilitating
communication uh similar problems arise
all over the place with different
constructions well there's a very good
answer to the what question namely
minimal structural distance Reigns
unchallenged it's just something that
the infant automatically applies always
but the how and the why question s they
remain a very simple and quite
likely correct answer one which has lots
of implications if it's TR true it has
to do with the general architecture of
the language
faculty uh there is an old dictum of
aristotles that languages sound with a
meaning Common Sense dictum but seems
it's not quite right that it should be
inverted uh languages meaning with sound
uh to put it more precisely the core of
the language faculty appears to be a
generative process that yields
structured Expressions that are
interpreted by the thought system
conceptual intentional system while
externalization to the sensory motor
system is a secondary process uh linear
order or some kind of order is clearly
required for externalization that's a
property of the sensory motor system
and of course it varies depending on the
sensory modality used for
externalization so it's different for
speech and sign uh but it doesn't seem
to enter into U at all into core sematic
processes process of thought and uh uh
planning that just seems to use
hierarchy not
order U so it's looks as though
linearization a reflex of the sensory
motor system well that's not
uncontroversial a lot of empirical
problems but U there's considerable
evidence I think mounting evidence that
it is indeed the case actually there's
also some interesting evidence in this
case from the
neurosciences there's a research group
in Milan which studied brain activity of
subjects who are presented with two
types of
stimuli or in both cases invented
sentences uh in one case the invented
sentences satisfy ug principles
and in the other case they don't conform
to them a particular example would be
for example NE negating a sentence by
placing the negative element after the
third world word uses Elementary
property of linearization well they
found that in the former case uh
invented systems using ug principles
there was normal activation in the
language areas of the brain brok as area
but when linear order was used there
wasn't activation in brooker's area just
all over the place in other words the
subjects were treating it as some kind
of a puzzle but not a linguistic problem
uh well that's uh this is a difficult
but potentially quite Rich uh research
area actually the linguist in the group
Andrea Morrow is well known to some of
you uh well that conclusion fits very
well
with the little that we know about
Evolution uh and what we know about
language much more generally and if this
is correct we immediately derive answers
to the how and the why questions for
auxiliary inversion uh linear order is
simply not available for the language
learner who is Guided by a very simple
ug principle that determines the general
architecture of language relying on the
third Factor uh condition of minimal uh
computation it's probably an overriding
principle that the brain operates with
all together well there are broader
implications if you think it through one
consequence is that
communication must be a peripheral
aspect of language if externalization
altogether secondary communication is
even more so and that means that the
extensive literature of speculation on
language evolution is on the wrong track
to start with one reason why it never
gets anywhere actually there's much more
substantial evidence for this conclusion
some having to do with evolutionary
considerations but uh more substantive
Ones based on fundamental properties of
language design it's slightly technical
but I'll try to keep it simple uh I
mentioned before that contiguous and
non-contiguous relations in language
which in earlier years were distributed
between different parts of the system
phrase structure and
transformational uh it's now understood
that they can be unified under the
simplest computational operation
possible they call it merge it's an
operation that's the core of any
computational system it simply says take
two objects that have already been
formed and uh construct a new object
from them uh so the call the two objects
ICT X and Y construct Z well the the
third Factor principle of minimal
computation has a consequence it
dictates that neither X nor y can be
modified by the
operation and that they appear unordered
that's the simplest operation hence the
right one unless we have counter
evidence and that's a plausible
assumption the lack of order for the
reasons I discuss that simply means that
uh so say suppose neither X nor Y is
part of the other well then merge just
yields the set containing X and Y okay
no word uh no change that's call that
external merge well suppose that one is
part of the other that's the other
possible case uh say Y is part of X and
then if you think it through the result
of merge is again a set but it's the set
containing y and the set XY now that's
going to have two copies of Y one
outside XY one
inside call that internal
merge and notice that both of these
operations come
free uh it would require some
stipulation to Bar either one of them so
if we're working with the simplest
possible system they're both there
automatically but in internal merge if
you think about it yields displacement
non-contiguous relation in fact it turns
out to yield displacement in a form
that's appropriate for the thought
system for the CI system so say take a
simple sentence which books did John
read or its analog and other languages
here the phrase which books has two
sematic roles uh it receives its role as
the object of read just as in the case
of read books and it's also an
interrogative operator which technically
terms binds the variable uh that's in
the object position so that the
interpretation is something like for
which books XS John read books X now
notice that that can be read off
directly from the generated structure
which books did John read which books
which is automatically the pro the
product of internal merge with no
further comment so in this and in
numerable much more complex cases
internal merge gives the forms directly
which are what you need for sematic
interpretation for the conceptual
intentional system for Thought uh that
however notice that these are the wrong
structures for the sensory motor system
the universally in language Only The
structurally prominent copy is
pronounced there actually an interesting
class of exceptions which support the
generalization if you look at them
closely well that follows from another
principle of minimal computation namely
pronounce as little as possible which is
a huge saving of effort if you look at
what goes on in the brain well the
result is that the articulated sentences
have
gaps which books did you read something
missing Gap and as it is well known to
anyone who has uh worked on perception
of language or parsing of language uh
that yields very difficult problems of
interpretation so-called filler Gap
problems are the main problems in
developing parsing
programs uh if everything was pronounced
you wouldn't have those problems you
know what's there but minimal
computation uh
forces a lack of communicative
problems uh well
um the conclusion appears to be that uh
if language is perfectly designed if it
became something like a snowflake when
it suddenly
emerged maybe 60 70,000 years ago then
it's going to provide structures with
the right sematic interpretations but
difficulties for
communication now that's pretty well
established there are many such cases so
am ambiguous sentences so-called Garden
Path sentences where you start
interpreting them but it's the wrong way
because total structure as something
else um so-called Island constructions
like ECP and others in general where we
understand these at all it appears that
these structures follow they result from
free unconstrained functioning of the
simplest rules minimizing computation
but they yield difficulties for
communication well that's just
scratching the surface but perhaps it's
enough to suggest the kind of arguments
that appear to provide pretty strong
support for the conclusion that language
is meaning with sound this inverts
Aristotle's dictum and that
externalization and A4 communication are
secondary aspects case of communication
tertiary aspects of language use uh well
oxen verion has been the topic of quite
a considerable industry and
computational cognitive science is
seeking to show that the child acquires
this knowledge on the basis of a
statistical analysis of a corpus of data
in accord with the non-existence thesis
and new papers appear regularly in the
scientific journals up to the last few
weeks in fact that they have very
curious properties one is that each one
fails
dramatically by the criteria of science
but they're all held as success in the
literature as in fact they sometimes are
in accord with the novel conception of
success mentioned earlier rough roughly
approximating unanalyzed data uh another
curious property is that each approach
uh ignores the simple explanation which
in fact generalizes to many other
constructions in all languages
structural distances minimized a third
curious property is it wouldn't matter
if the approach is succeeded because
they'd leave the basic questions
untouched namely why is structural
rather than linear distance minimized
universally in all languages and all
constructions in which the question
arises for for the most part these
methods statistical analysis would work
or very similar ones would work just as
well in a pseudo language that used
linear distance rather than structural
distance for inter ation in such cases
as say can eagles that fly swim and that
raises a background question which these
approaches don't raise how does the
child know the intended
interpretation uh unless it's already
relying on the minimal structural
distance principle without any data at
all uh so the proposals big literature
just don't they make no sense at all but
they're it's the main examp example in
computational cognitive science and the
study of language well another there's
one other case that's discussed in the
nonexistence literature worth looking at
has to do with what's called binding
Theory the relation between a term and a
a term that
U basically has the same reference U so
for example take the sentence do they
expect John to see each other next week
well that sentence is sharply this
deviant there's no antecedent for each
other but if you delete John you get do
they expect to see each other uh next
week that's fine uh they is the
antecedent of each other uh this is one
of the rare cases of any significance
that is discussed in the non-existence
literature recent paper in fact two Co
cognitive scientists argue that uh the
relation between they and each other
is I'm quoting is simply an instance of
a general cognitive tendency to resolve
ambiguities rapidly in linguistic and
perceptual input specifically to
establish the antecedent anaphor
relation they each other relation as
quickly as possible in comprehension so
the facts might rely on an innate
constraint but not one that's part of ug
while the claim as formulated is
instantly refus reputed by the simple
example I mentioned so if John is
present in the sentence do they expect
John to see each other then the quickest
way to resolve the interpretation is to
take they to be the antecedent since
John can't be well even if there's some
way around this problem The Proposal
fails even if John doesn't appear so
take the sentence who do they expect to
see each other next week well uh
the closest aned is they but that's not
the way you interpret it
uh it's intuitively clear that uh what
it means
is which is the person act the thing
acts such that they expect to see x uh
that they expect X to see each other not
John not they that's obvious from the
interpretation well the reason for all
this is intuitively clear the ear
doesn't hear an antecedent for each
other closer to it than they but the
Mind perceives it uh namely it perceives
it in the interpretation for which book
X they expect the person X to see each
other next week so you get X being the
anced of each other even though it isn't
there and uh if you think about it for a
minute you'll see that this arises from
internal merge much like the example
which books did John Reed uh in brief as
soon as you pay attention to the most
Elementary facts it appears that you
just have to reintroduce rule systems of
the kind that the authors are trying to
avoid and much else if you go beyond
these well despite the widespread and
often quite enthusiastic endorsement
it's hard to find evidence or argument
to support the non-existence approaches
on the contrary there's quite good
reason to believe that language does
exist as a module of the Mind alongside
of others and that this meeting has a
topic uh the way to pursue the topic
would be to discover the specific
properties of each of these modules and
the ways in which they interact well
that effort quickly becomes more
technical than I can talk about here uh
but when I think you find when you
pursue it there's quite a lot to say
about the design of language along L I
briefly mentioned and also some other
cognitive systems so for example the
navigational systems of insects or
mamalian visual perception and
organization of action few others but
the word and in the title remains
elusive uh not a great deal is known
about how these systems interact or even
compare well I don't want to end without
mentioning at least mentioning another
serious problem which has also been
ignored uh a computational
procedure uh requires certain atoms of
computation smallest pieces so for
language something like a Le lexicon of
minimal elements but even the simplest
of these pose fundamental problems
fundamental puzzles how do they relate
how do they relate to the Mind external
World well there's two aspects to this
problem meaning and sound the latter is
secondary if the reasoning I reviewed
proves to be accurate uh for sound uh we
at least know where to look the answers
lie in articulatory and acoustic
phonetics problems are difficult they've
been studied intensively for 60 years
with high-tech equipment uh give some
answers but leaves many unresolved what
about meaning well there's a standard
answer in this cas space the standard
answer is provided by referentialist
Doctrine the word cow picks out cows it
may be a causal relation standard
argument and philosophy and cognitive
science and Linguistics uh something
like that does seem to be true for
animal
communication so in take a look at the
symbols in animal communication they
seem to have that property they seem
invariably to relate to some physically
identifiable external symbol or internal
state so say a veret monkey has a
warning cry that comes out reflexively
when leaves are moving in a certain way
and maybe it means a Predators coming or
something that means I'm hungry you know
it can relate to a state that can be
identified by a
physicist a natural scientist
uh externally or internally however
nothing like even remotely like that
seems to be true for the simplest
elements of human language cow River
person tree pick anyone you want I won't
have time to go into it but uh it think
about it for a few minutes you see it's
just totally false well there are
inklings of that understanding in
Aristotle and his discussion of what he
called matter and form but it was
considerably enriched during the first
cognitive revolution of the 17th century
the early Scientific Revolution mainly
in the work of uh British neoplatonists
and the classical empiricists they
recognized that the elementary elements
of language and of thought are not
directly linked to mind independent
external entities in other words there's
no notion of reference in human language
and thought there's an action of
referring but that's a very different
matter rather the basic elements provide
Rich perspectives for interpreting the
Mind independent world that involves
gestal properties cause and effect
what's called sympathy of Parts the way
things hang together concerns directed
to a common end uh psychic
continuity and all and other mentally
imposed properties that's what happened
that what was happening roughly in that
period is that Aristotle's conception of
matter and form were separated uh
physics kept to
matter it eliminated form you know
design purpose and so on but with a
cognitive Revolution form came back
namely as part of our cognitive
processes for interpreting events and
that seems to be a core of property well
in this respect meaning turns out to be
rather similar to sound so every Act of
articulating some item say the internal
syllable T simplest syllable Every Act
of articulating it yields a physical
event but nobody seeks some category of
physical events associated with the
internal syllable wouldn't make any
sense similarly some by no means all of
the uses of the word cow or river person
uh some of them refer to physically
identifiable entities but there's no
category of such entities that's
identifiable even in principle by a
natural scientist investigating the Mind
external world and that was understood
so by the time of say David Hume
summarizing A Century of inquiry he said
I'll quote him that the identity that we
ascribe to vegetables animal bodies
artifacts persons in their minds and so
on that is the array of individuating
properties that pick them out he said is
only a fictitious one it's established
by uh the mental acts what we're called
cognos of powers as they were called in
the 17th century well most of this has
been forgotten unfortunately but there's
pretty strong evidence that it's
basically correct and once again a
failure to be puzzled is a serious error
it appears that the elements so
fundamental to human language and
thought reveal another vast Chasm
between humans and every other animal uh
that poses a huge problem for
evolutionary biology comparably huge
problem for acquisition of
language uh there's interesting
experimental evidence that uh uh
children acquire
words like say cow or river on as little
as a single exposure you just hear it
and they know all the rich meaning uh
well the meaning is somehow coming from
the inside without any direct evidence
and it's quite rich as investigation
shows the what how and why questions
raised by these systems have only barely
been explored despite their fundamental
significance for thought and action uh
the origins of the basic elements in
their
organization uh remain entirely unknown
and if Richard leanon is correct they
may actually remain a permanent mystery
for human
inquiry
thanks yeah okay the question is uh that
this contrast between inductivism and
deductivism seems to me strongly
influenced by Carl POA so my question is
influenced by what by Carl
poer poer yes the philosopher Carl poer
and so my question
is is has there been any influence by
Papa on your
work
poer was just describing what's common
sense science since the 17th century in
fact I would question your first
statement uh it's true that I've been
involved in a methodological critique
since the late' 40s but it's a
methodological critique of
nonscience
nonscience starts with just uh
collecting data and trying to make
inductive generalizations from it and it
gets absolutely nowhere you know you
just can't do it it's been understood in
fact one of the parts of the modern
Scientific Revolution So-Cal Galilean
Revolution e you don't even try that you
search the that's why scientists do
experiments uh in fact in Galileo's case
kind of thought experiments like he
didn't drop two balls off the top of the
tower of Pisa that would never have
worked he just had a very elegant
argument thought argument that explained
why a rate of fall wasn't going to be
affected by mass sometimes he may have
done experiments a lot of them didn't
but the point is ever since the 17th
century in fact even before the
scientists inquire of the world they
don't just observe it they inquire of
the world that's called experiment they
concoct situations that might give you
some insight and from them they make
some guesses about what the theories
might be and then they try other
experiments to test the theories and
ultimately they get sort of back to
phenomena but they really don't care
very much if they get back to the
phenomena because in fact the phenomena
themselves are so complex and so
involves so many variables that you just
don't try to approximate phenomenon take
the examples that I mentioned B
scientists don't don't try to
approximate bees swarming it's just too
complicated the wind's blowing you know
one of them changed his mind whatever uh
and physicists certainly don't uh you
know take a look at what's going on
outside the window and try to draw
inductive generalizations from it I mean
you go back far enough and maybe in you
know pre Classical Greece maybe science
looked like that but this is just
mythology it doesn't happen
and it couldn't happen scientists are
inquiring they're inquiring about nature
and the same is true in linguistics if
you're a field worker so you're working
you know some unstudied language in the
Amazon I mean if if all you can do is
take recordings okay you take recordings
but you're not going to find much if
you're really doing serious field work
you use the techniques that you learned
in your field methods course in college
namely you try to figure out the kinds
of questions that'll elicit data that
might be significant and relevant you
just take a look at masses of data you
basically get nothing just noise you
know so I don't it's true that it's a
methodological critique but it's a
methodological critique of something
that dominates in the human Sciences but
has absolutely nothing to do with
science that's true of the whole
behaviorist tradition I mean the IDE or
what was called Behavioral Science the
1950s all the human Sciences were called
Behavioral Science I that makes about as
much sense as calling physics meter
reading science I mean it's true that
you know take Edington and others you
can regard physics as in principle just
the study of meter readings but it's not
meter reading science you're using the
meter readings trying to discover
something about the world well behavior
is just data not all the data
incidentally just some of the data and
selected parts of that data if you
aren't smart enough to figure out which
ones may tell you something about the
human capacities and um the nature of
the mind but just to collect data and
you
know organize it somehow is is going to
get you nowhere and if you can't think
of anything else to do you have no ideas
then maybe you do that but uh it's not
the way science is done
next
question well then go there and then
right over
there I so okay wait a wait a moment
there's a the the the guy behind and
you Professor Jones would you be so kind
as to tell us uh something more about
the third factors uh you mentioned
so-called forms of uh nature laws of
nature laws of form and maybe uh could
you mention a couple of authors one or
two possibly that you found
inspirational uh and finding out about
third factors and coming up with that
idea thank you well the the um the basic
third Factor properties uh back in the
50s and 60s they used to be called
Simplicity okay you want to find the
simplest systems so if there's
redundance in the system you want to
eliminate it uh if there are complicated
rules you want to reduce them to Simple
Rules and so on when all of this is
rethought in more modern terms it
basically all reduces to the principle
of minimal
computation you want computation to be
as limited as possible now minimal
computation isn't perfectly understood
you know a lot of possible theories of
minimal computation but a lot of aspects
of it are pretty well understood and it
is found uh all over the place in the
natural world so for example to take one
surprising and interesting result
there's a tiny animal called the
neemod the simplest animal that
anybody's been able to study has 800
cells 300 neurons and the neural wiring
is completely underst
so you know exactly how they're related
incidentally nobody knows why they
behave the way they do you know the it's
like knowing the genome but not knowing
what organism is going to come out
there's too many other things going on
but at least the neural wiring is
understood and there is a interesting
study by scientist the University of
Maryland who's who has shown that you
get exactly that wiring if you assume
that the wiring system is minimal in a
very specific sense the sense that's
used that is used by say Engineers when
they're trying to design the simplest
transistor you try to minimize wire
length total wire length basically and
if you do that you get the wiring system
of the neote actually he argues much
beyond that you probably get the wiring
system for all organisms like one
fundamental property of organisms is
that the brain is at one end so you know
up here not down here uh and that's true
of organisms generally the organisms are
kind of long thin things mostly uh and
uh the brain is at one end not in the
middle and he gives an interesting
argument that that also follows from
minimal wiring uh and there are other
things in nature that are known to be
like that well there's some openness and
and there should be as to what exactly
minimal computation is it's used in
computer science all the time uh and
then biology and elsewhere and some
simple ideas carry pretty far in uh in
these cases like the few cases that I
mentioned all depended on minimal
distance and the question is what kind
of minimal distance is it structural or
linear uh does it involve missing
elements that the mind hears but the ear
doesn't uh or it doesn't in fact it does
so that's the kind of Principle as to
which authors
were I I don't know what to say you know
most things you kind of sort of figure
out for yourself and then you're excited
to find that somebody else discovered it
you know and go look at
that stf first you and yeah then then
then we go there but first you y
what gu what is your opinion on the
hypothesis that as tool
of keep the keep the micro on to your
mouth
again what is your opinion on the
hypothesis that as a um a tool of
thought language is the mechanism that
makes cross modul thought possible for
humans that language is a tool of
thought and makes Cross modu of thought
possible I couldn't hear the last
part um that without language there can
couldn't think no that just cannot be
cross modular can there be think thought
without language yes what's your opinion
the idea that language is a tool of
thought I think is correct now that's
what I had in mind when I said we have
to invert Aristotle's dicum the language
is really
meaning uh externalization one way or
another is something secondary so yes
it's a tool of thought but once you have
this basic comp this lucky or unlucky
person 75,000 years ago say who had that
mutation and got the minimal
computational operation that person
could think nobody else could think at
least in the sense that we think with
language they could have complex
Expressions which mean things and could
make up invent uh abstract worlds and
imagine what would happen in them and so
on that person had a very unusual
Advantage uh it couldn't communicate
with anybody because that was the only
person who had it mutations occur in an
individual not in a group so some
individual got this capacity for uh
construction of an infinite array of
Expressions which map on to the thought
system and that person could
think for for him or herself using uh
the system well you know a capacity like
that can get transmitted to
offspring and if it had some Advantage
which it probably did uh then that those
Offspring might turn out to dominate The
Society these are small groups these are
Hunter gather groups very small uh so
you know over some time many people
might have had the capacity
well at that point some right guy might
have had the idea of externalizing it
and then what you're thinking somebody
else can figure out too probably
something like that is the way language
evolved now can you have thought without
language it's an unanswerable question
because we don't know what we mean by
thought like uh does your dog think for
example I mean it certainly does things
that look like thinking but whether
they're thinking or not you know we
don't know because we have no real
conception of thought and uh uh we don't
know what's going on inside the dog you
know actually there's a lot of
discussion those of you in computer
science know about this of whether
machines can think and it has an
interesting history it goes back to a
paper by the great mathematician Alan
Turing back around 1950 he wrote a short
paper called can machines think some
title like that he was also one of
the
original inventors of the modern
computer he studied it abstractly but
it's the basis for modern computers is
his mathematical work and is really one
of the outstanding mathematicians
however and there's a lot of work that's
come out of that for that example
there's a there's a competition every
year in which you know smart the
computer scientists a invent program he
he gave it a test nowadays it's called
the touring test he called it the
imitation game uh he asked Can you
construct a prog when people talk about
machines they mean programs the computer
itself is no good for anything except
maybe it's a paper weight but the
program in the machine does things and U
the idea is to construct a program which
can fool a human Observer into believing
it's a person that's essentially what it
comes down to and there are competitions
every year with huge prizes for the
person who does best in this it's all
total nonsense and the interesting thing
about it is that touring said so if you
read that eight page paper not hard to
read he says the question whether
machines think is too meaningless to
deserve
discussion because we have no conception
of what thought is we want to call it
thought okay it's like asking the
submarine swim well it's it's not a
factual question it's a question whether
you want to extend the metaphor to
submarines uh the airplanes fly in some
languages yes other languages no it's a
question of what metaphor we like so the
question is too meaningless to deserve
discussion he nevertheless thought it
was a good idea to pursue it because it
might encourage people to build better
machines and in fact that's pretty much
what's happened if you take the things
that are famous you know like IBM deep
blue you know IBM built some huge
complicated machine which plays chess
and at one point it beat the best Grand
Master and all over the newspapers
machines are smarter than people it's
totally meaningless it was predictable
in advance I remember discussions about
this 60 years ago it's predictable in
advance that sooner or later you'd be
able to program a computer that would
beat any Chessmaster the reason is
you've got a big bunch of grand Masters
sitting around thinking of every
possible contingency it's a finite game
CH and they sooner or later work
something out which is better than what
a single grandm can do in 45 minutes so
sooner or later you get a better program
completely meaningless except maybe for
selling machines and that's actually
what IBM uses it for it uses it for
propaganda recently there was another
case that hit the newspapers I don't
know if it did hear about some the story
what there's some game that they play on
television it's called Jeopardy you know
people make guesses about things and
they designed the machine that beat the
best humans in Jeopardy again total
triviality you learn absolutely nothing
from it uh it's uh you don't know
anything about humans you don't anything
about thought all you know is if you
work hard enough you can get a program
that will do complicated things uh
meaningless so and the same problem
arises about whether animals think or
whether say a two-day old infant
thinks it's doing things that look
rational and so on but whether that's
thought or not is kind of like asking
whether submarin swim if you want to
call it swimming they do if you don't
want to call it swimming they don't you
know
but it's it's not a it's just like
touring said it's not a real question
so
microphone here there are two questions
good yeah okay then then first start
there and then you are the next yeah
because you're closer you then he the
question then you and then we are a
little bit coming to an end I think gu
so here two questions about w eight
questions um in the
sentence who did John see uh who has two
roles one indicated by its original
position in the object position and the
other one at the front of the sentence
uh indicating uh its role as wh
operator what about languages such as
Chinese where you have who such as what
such as Chinese Chinese without wh
movement visible wh movement well that's
yeah yes that would that's the first
question second question you also have
so-called uh longdistance wh questions
like who did you say Bill thought hun
saw yeah and there is good evidence uh
that the movement to the front of the
sentence in these cases is peace meal
stepwise yeah are there additional
semantic roles in these intermediate
steps so these would be the two
questions well that's um the second
question is tricky uh there is very good
evidence that it's peac meal and that
incidentally is another application of
minimal communic computation a
computation is simpler if it goes in
small steps if it's broken up into small
steps and there is pretty good empirical
evidence been around for about 40 40
years or so that in fact it is in small
steps that raises the question whether
the the second question you asked
whether these intermediate steps have
interpretations that's pretty hard to
tease out these these are questions of
what's called
reconstruction they're quite difficult
questions they get into subtle
considerations of a variable binding
like can you move a wh over a
quantifier and have it still be
interpreted but not under that
quantifier these get you into sentences
that are quite subtle and complex now
the fact of the matter seems to be is
that by and large they
don't except maybe in pretty subtle
cases the intermediate positions don't
seem to have u u interpretations there's
arguments to the contrary Julie legate
do one person who's found interesting
evidence that in some cases they do get
interpretations uh but and that does
raise an interesting question why
doesn't that happen I think there's some
answers to it the answers to it have to
do with u something I really can't go
into here but if you look at it's What's
called the theory of projection so if
you go back to say you're obviously know
Linguistics so you'll understand you go
back to phrase structure grammar you
know back U 50 years ago uh every
category
had projected to something xar Theory it
becomes explicit so you know read books
becomes is identified as a verb phrase
not a noun phrase okay traditional
grammar that means that the verb
projects but the noun doesn't and it was
assumed in those theories that
everything has a
projection modern terminology is a label
everything has a label that's probably
wrong it's probably the case that that
the only things that are labeled are
those that enter into further
computation cuz that's the only role of
the label the role of the label is to
tell the generative system what kind of
an object are you and if you don't have
a lab if you don't enter into
computation you don't want to know that
now successive cyclic movement the kind
you're talking about
uh the intermediate positions don't have
labels there's very good reasons to
think that they don't have labels
because of the simplest way of producing
labels and that's the right result that
means that they must move on and they
won't get an interpretation which seems
to be the overwhelmingly true conclusion
so it it it did it did raise questions
the question you raise a very serious
one it's been around for a long time but
the there's probably an answer for it
again in terms of minimal communication
this is isn't in print but there's you
know there's work on this I've given a
number of talks about it uh the first
question about Chinese and similar
languages that have what's called wh and
situ that is the wh
phrase only has it only appears in one
position the position where it gets its
sematic role U those have been studied
extensive ly since work by Jim hang back
around
1980 uh he argued and gave interesting
evidence that even in Chinese his native
language uh even if though you don't
hear the thing move uh it's mentally
moving it's what's called cover movement
it's moving but doesn't leave uh visual
you know bable evidence that it's moving
and the his basic argument was that
Chinese questions have essentially the
same properties as U English or German
like questions where the thing actually
moves and those properties can be
explained in terms of the success of
cyclic movement so it therefore looks as
though it's successively cyclically
moving in Chinese now since then there's
other work by the Tanya Reinhardt and
Dylan Sai and others with a different
approach saying that in Chinese type
languages there's actually an
operator high up uh which is seeking the
wh phrase by you know ordinary matching
operations gree it's called and it's uh
it has a special sematic function which
yields the interpretation of the
question so these these two competing
theories around pretty much about
whether there's actual movement or an
operator that gives slightly different
interpretations than actual movement but
that's uh uh normal you know when you
make a
generalization in the Natural Sciences
usually it's not true there you find
exceptions you find exceptions because
the world's more complicated so for but
in the Natural Science here's a
difference in method in the approach to
the human sciences and the Natural
Sciences in the human Sciences when
people find find apparent exceptions to
a generalization to say okay we throw
out the generalization there's nothing
there anything can happen you know and
there's plenty of current papers that
draw that conclusion that's exact it's
not at all the way you work in the
Natural Sciences so for example it was
discovered you know many years ago that
uh Neptune the planet Neptune does not
have the expected elliptical
orbit it's there's perturbations and the
orbit well if you treated it the way
people treat Linguistics you would have
said okay let's throw out Kepler's and
Newton's Laws I got a counter example
nobody did that what people did was try
to figure out why there's it's not
working that way well finally they
discovered Pluto okay it turned out it's
now it's working the way it's supposed
to that's the way all of Natural Science
works at least since the 17th century
probably long before uh but it in the
human Sciences there's just a different
attitude towards it uh if a apparent
generalization doesn't seem to work you
throw out everything and you say okay
everything goes you're back to the
non-existence approach it's a very
strange way in which we study our own
minds you know not using the approaches
of the
Sciences kind of like the behaviorism
case z z yeah
yeah um
hello um first of all thank you for your
talk um I'm not a linguist so uh excuse
my question you've talked about
reversing the dicum of Aristotle and I
would like to know um whether you
believe that language can express
through structure more than the meaning
of its words for instance in poetry
where we have repetition to express
beauty or
desire um could you comment on that
please yeah you see that's a yeah that
certainly is true and actually that's an
observation which I don't know how far
in a way it goes back to Plato I guess
but it was expressed in kind of modern
terms by a Spanish uh philosopher
linguist in the 16th century one hate he
uh described what he called three kinds
of intelligence three levels of
intelligence
the lowest level is animals they're kind
of like reflex machines the middle level
is humans they can create new
Expressions new thoughts he couldn't say
how you know it's too early for that but
he kind of recognized that there's some
creative aspect to normal language use
and then he said there's a third
category what you're talking about uh
poetic use of language or the art and
here he followed Plato he said there's a
mixture of Madness in that but it's some
new kind of it's a higher kind of uh use
of language than the normal creative use
and yeah sure that's some something like
that c obviously true you know um true
creativity what we call Creative acts
are different than the Innovative acts
that we carry out all the time what what
that difference is
that's what the Aesthetics aesthetic
theory is about but it's certainly you
know basically correct I have a
suggestion is pretty late now we have 20
to10 right now and I have a suggestion I
saw here three and
some yeah so Al there are two one how
many I one
two
three four five no no
my suggestion is that you are that you
come with the faculty into the doent
Sima and there will be an
occasion um with a with a glass of wine
or beer to put the question personally
to Professor Shamsky okay
yeah
