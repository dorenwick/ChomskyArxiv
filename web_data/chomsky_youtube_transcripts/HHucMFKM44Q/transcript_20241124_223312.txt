intellectual heavyweights don't come
much weightier than Noom Chomsky
philosopher logician cognitive scientist
and above all the father of modern
Linguistics at 85 he's still going
strong I'm nor chsky I'm a on the
faculty at MIT and I've been uh getting
more and more heavily involved in atti
war activities for the last few
years
but it is his politics uncompromising
and radical that keeps him in the public
eye he's venerated by many loathed by
many occasionally feared but is his
critique of the West its foreign policy
its economic system it's hypocrisy is
that a critique that connects to the
ordinary people that he strives to help
neoliberal democracy instead of citizens
it produces consumers instead of
communities it prod produces shopping
walls the net result is atomized Society
of disengaged individuals who feel
demoralized and socially powerless do
you feel demoralized and
Powerless not
really well I think that's bit than I
think that goes too negative for me like
I come from a little village and I
certainly don't think that we are little
separed dehumanized individuals do you
think you're consumers rather than
citizens that it sort of no no no all no
see I think he probably thinks that
you're made to feel content with some
material Goods you work and you buy a
microwave oven or something but that
really maybe deep down that's not you
don't want it yeah but is he right on
that no he's not now I'm going to give
you another one okay cuz you're very
good at
this the more you can increase fear of
drugs crime welfare mothers immigrants
and Aliens the more you control all the
people that's a very difficult one
because immigration is the biggest
question well it certainly seems to be
the topic that they want us to be
focused on the most at the moment don't
be scared of the most how can I make you
scared of something that's happening
like it's natural yeah it's natural
there always going to be single mothers
and drug addicts and immigrants so how
can I use that to place fear on it but
you feel you can make up your own minds
on these issues oh yes yes don't read
yes yes I've got a I've got a brain well
there's a Time and place for philosophy
and Revolution but to the possible
disappointment of Noom Chomsky that time
and place is not here and now they'll
have to wait until at least after
Christmas and thanks to all those people
who really did engage actually with the
quotes from The Professor good evening
and thanks for coming in I wonder
whether it annoys you at the moment that
the world is rebelling there's anger out
there the system has been questioned the
elite are unpopular in a way that I
think you would uh encourage and yet
it's not really
the forces are not gathering around your
view in some ways they're more it's more
right-wing discontent the Tea Party in
the US the ukip party here what do you
think those exist and I think they uh
reflect an understandable anger at a a
neoliberal period in which the majority
of the population has suffered
considerably while enormous wealth and
power has been accumulated in a tiny
fraction of the uh Society Democratic
forms have been substantially reduced
there's plenty of evidence for that uh
uh but what you just but it's not
entirely correct so for example hundreds
of thousands of people demonstrated in
the streets of New York a couple of
weeks ago in calling for serious action
about uh dealing with the climate
catastrophe that's a huge that's a
representative of a huge part of the
population and I think um anger and
concern take many different forms but
they have uh you can find lots of common
Roots yeah and in in Spain and Greece
the leftwing have come out on top if you
like of the uh of the discontent but it
is um you know reading those quotes to
to some Ordinary People it is I suppose
one of the difficulties of your position
that you end up in a way having to take
a view of what of you tell telling them
what you think would be good for them
and them not quite really being on your
wavelength is that a fair critique of
the NM Chomsky philosophy that's not my
experience I spend an enormous amount of
time giving uh talks discussions uh all
classes of people all over I don't tell
them what to think I tell them what I
think uh encourage them to develop their
own ideas and I think we quite often see
things the same way but when you say
people have been made into consumers
rather than than citizens is is is that
could that be of being Pat rizing to
people as though they they're kind of
suckers for being material consumers as
opposed to thinking bigger things about
their lives no I don't I think they're
suffering from a situation in which they
are not citizens they're not
participants it's easy to demonstrate
that uh I know the United States better
but I think it's essentially the same
here and one of the major topics in
mainstream political science is uh the
relation between attitudes and politic
it's not hard to study policy we see
attitudes we determine from very
extensive and quite accurate and
consistent polling and the results are
striking it turns out that for about 70%
of the population uh the lower 70% on
the income scale their attitudes have
zero impact on policy they're just
ignored by their representatives As you
move that's really that really surpris
surprises me because here I I think
politicians sometimes feel they they're
running to catch up with where the
public are particularly on issues like
immigration for example where they're
kind of it was one they didn't spot but
the public really did I'm sorry but the
public has U mixed attitudes on
immigration actually this is very well
studied don't take my word for it in two
minutes I can give you references As you
move up the income scale you get more
influence on policy when you get to the
very top which is a fraction of 1% you
essentially have policy made this is
true on issue after issue those that are
whether it's taxes uh uh military
immigration whatever you like uh and
well it's certainly believable that the
the the sort of more powerful and
important people the ones who run the
it's not just powerful and they're not
powerful and important they control the
wealth of the society and that puts them
in a position essentially to purchase
the government and its actions and
that's simply demonstrated in this
respect uh people are losing the
capacity to be citizens let me just ask
you one last last question because it we
are on a Time budget here and I I it's
about Ferguson what's going on over in
the US I wonder whether back in the
1960s you would have imagined that these
tensions would still be around in the
2010s well there's a long history uh the
first slaves came to the United States
States in
1619 that's about 500 years I no time to
run through the history but if you look
through it during this period there have
been literally a few decades scattered
decades in which African-Americans the
majority had a fairly decent shot at
entering the mainstream Society uh the
uh especially black males are targets
for uh abuse by the uh security system
by the uh in the so-called drug war and
killings and lack of opportunity for
employment and so on uh whatever when
things like Ferguson happening they're
lighting a match where the kindling is
pretty dry
