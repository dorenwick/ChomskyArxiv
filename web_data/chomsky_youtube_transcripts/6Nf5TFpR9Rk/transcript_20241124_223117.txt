professor thompson just one last
question because on our local
uh uh in in our local setting on the
kashmir question and what's going on in
india i'm sure it's deeply painful for
you as well
who have who's visited india many times
it's a
inspirational places like west bengal
and kerala and so on
about your good friend arundhati roy uh
the late ekbal ahmed they wrote about
kashmir
you must be following what's going on in
in kashmir
and in india as a truly what arundhati
roy
aptly distinguishes say from say trump
uh as just representing trump not some
ideology but
modi really coming from a fascist
movement emerging from the 1920s just
very very brief thoughts on what's going
on
uh in india and kashmir yeah
i'll say just a word about that but
first another word
wherever we are our prime concern
should be where we are in a position
to affect what happens that's typically
our own
country so for me the crucial issues are
what's done by the united states
for you the crucial issues are what's
happening in pakistan
uh we can certainly talk about india but
pakistan is the highest priority for you
just same if you're in if you're in
new delhi your highest priority is india
okay with that in the background what's
happening in india is
disgraceful uh modi is
tearing the shreds the last
remnants of america of indian secular
democracy which was
quite lively ineffective and within
india
turning it into a right wing in new
nationalist
state uh highly repressive of
the huge muslim population kashmir earth
has just
taken it over destroying the countries
all of its autonomy the countries
has long been under military rule but
now it's just
extraordinary it's just total repression
uh people locked up under
massive control by the indian
military forces now this is a disaster
and regrettably
modi has high popular support
pulls through great support not only
this is tearing
the country apart but even
with a horrifying uh
policies with regard to the corona virus
which is killing huge numbers of indians
but the popular support remains it's
these are some of the disasters of
modern affairs
