and what is your assessment of what's
been happening in
Ferguson well let's start with the last
and what's happening in Ferguson is a
reenactment of 500 years of American
History uh goes back to
1619 slaves were brought over they were
t tortured terrorized and treated
hideously you want to know how they were
treated take a look at this morning's
New York Times there's a very evocative
article on Isis and how it treated yazid
prisoners that's American history that's
the way our africanamerican population
was
treated worse than that in fact for a
long period in fact as I said there's
only a few breaks in it uh
militarization was one of the techniques
of crushing uh the the slave movement
and everything that followed from now
it's incarceration and militarization of
police we're reenacting 500 years of
American History you have to understand
that uh and that's hard to deal with uh
but it has to be faced seriously you can
argue about the details of what happened
in furb but the background and the
general framework was hideously clear
should be perfectly obvious anyone who
knows anything about an American history
it's with us all the time the non
indictment of Jaren Wilson means he got
away with murder he murdered Michael
Brown and right now he's going to get
away with
[Applause]
it
you are unlocky assembled and blocking
the street you need to disperse
immediately or you will be subject to
arrest do it
now you need to stop throwing rocks at
the
[Music]
police this travesty of Injustice you
haven't seen anything yet we're getting
ready to tell America in a very bold
nonviolent way that we're tired of the
murder of our boys on the streets of
America we're tired of looking and
seeing the material the the militaristic
way that they are controlling our
communities and shooting our boys down
