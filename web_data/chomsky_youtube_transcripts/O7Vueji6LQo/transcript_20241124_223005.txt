now you talk about Terror
[Music]
what about for me
I've been terrorized
all my days
[Music]
having all my days
[Music]
all intellectuals of our generation at
least if they're genuine intellectuals
or in some sense children of Noam
Chomsky no single contemporary
intellectual has broken more ground or
elucidated more of our reality as a
society nation and Empire than Noam
Chomsky he is a world-renowned linguist
philosopher cognitive scientist essay a
social critic as well as a Fearless
political activist
he is the author of more than 150 books
on topics that include Linguistics the
press the inner workings of Empire the
israel-palestine conflict and the War
Industry
he is a Laureate professor of
linguistics at the University of Arizona
and an Institute professor emeritus at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology his books include hegemony
for survival for reasons of State
American power and the new mandarins
understanding power the Chomsky Foucault
debate on human nature on language
objectivity and liberal scholarship the
Fateful triangle and many others his
latest book is notes on Resistance
interviews by David barsamian joining me
is Professor Noam Chomsky
so gnome I want to begin with a quote
David mentions in the book from Edward
syed's preface in the 25th anniversary
edition of syed's book orientalism about
the role of intellectuals in
perpetuating the crimes and avarice of
Empire these are saeed's words every
single Empire in its official discourse
has said that it is not like all the
others that its circumstances are
special that it has a mission to
Enlighten civilize and bring order and
democracy and that it uses Force only as
a last resort and sadder still there
always is a chorus of willing
intellectuals to say calming words about
benign or altruistic Empires as if one
shouldn't trust the evidence of one's
own eyes watching the destruction and
the misery and death brought by the
latest civil trees can you talk about
this battle between these intellectual
posers and genuine intellectuals a
battle that I think is defined much of
your own life
well Edwards comment is quite accurate
this as far as I'm aware I can't think
of an exception to it
and it's one of the reasons why the talk
about American exceptionalism is that
ridiculous joke
every other Empire has been made exactly
the same absurd claims that we have and
that includes
the most distinguished intellectuals
that's the part that's quite
striking I think
so it takes a a predecessor in Imperial
domination written
uh just now after a couple of hundred
years
there's the bear beginning of
reflection scholarship
on the horrendous atrocities that the
British Empire carried out for centuries
and actually there were a few
who didn't recognize it like Adam Smith
near the beginning
who condemned the
Savage and Justice of the British in
India at a time when everyone was either
not paying attention or loading it but
overwhelming but that's a rare exception
as I say it's even some of the most
distinguished figures so it's hard to
find
modern intellectuals there's more uh it
was more worthy of a claim and respect
than Jon Stewart Mill
very few can try to choose take a look
at his ratings on the British Empire
so in
1859 important year he wrote an article
on Intervention
just even taught in law schools today
and as usual with his writing and
careful judicious uh
basically says intervention is wrong but
he says there are some exceptions
the exception surprisingly is England
is such an Angelic power that it just
must intervene uh even though others
can't understand our nobility
publicly on us cannot comprehend that
our interventions are just for the
benefit of the world when we intervene
in India which is what it was
recommending further expansion of the
British Empire in India it's just for
the benefit of the barbarians and even
if others can't understand it we just
and accuse us of all sorts of things we
have to continue well it was
particularly interesting about this was
not only the content from a highly
distinguished figure but the timing
was right after some of the worst
atrocities that written carried out in
India the crushing of what they call the
Indian Mutiny barbaric
vicious
attacks
and Mill of course knew all about them
they were discussed in Parliament he
himself was an officer of the East India
Company knew exactly what was going on
and furthermore he knew that the purpose
of the intervention was to expand
Britain's Narco trafficking into our
Empire Britain at that time was running
the biggest Narco trafficking Empire in
history where they needed the opium from
India to carry it forward the purpose
was to break into China by violence and
deceit and compel the Chinese to accept
British factors which they didn't want
in British domination controlled Neil
knew all of this in one part of his mind
but was writing what I just said in
another part of his mind
and unfortunately that's not untypical
in fact if you look at the
you mentioned genuine intellectuals
they're a very rare species and take a
look at the the term intellectual
came into regular usage in its modern
sense at the time of the Dreyfus trial
in in France uh
there were some writers artists
and Minnesota was the leading one who
did
strongly defend
Dreyfus against uh outrageous Lloyd
charges that led him to be sent off to
in prison Island
but they were bitterly attacked by the
mainstream of intellectuals the
Immortals of the uh
Academy forces
attacked these Raiders and artists who
dare to criticize their
marvelous institutions the Army and the
state and so on actually Amazon himself
had to flee for his life
three friends
that's the norm
there are which we're calling gen and
intellectuals around The Fringe but
they're not treated nicely
how badly they're treated depends on the
nature of the society we couldn't trace
this back to Classical Greece
when the
guy who had to drink the hemlock and
commit suicide was the one who was uh
disturbing corrupting the Youth of
Athens by asking too many questions well
that's the pattern through history
there's a fringe untreated nicely
so it's it's my perception and and uh
you were there that there was more space
for independent intellectual thought in
Academia in the Press uh you know public
intellectuals see right Mills and that
this space has closed over time I mean
your own work is often not included in
University
syllabi because it's considered too
controversial would you agree that that
space has narrowed uh and if it if you
do agree why do you think it's happened
and what are the consequences
I'm not sure that it's happened actually
we tend to forget what things were like
in the past now first of all there was
the whole McCarthy igerian which
had a cast a call over all the academic
fields
but if you look back say to the 1960s
you could hardly find a
a Marxist Economist let's say the
finding outstanding economists like Paul
Sweezy couldn't get a position uh now
you can find the scattering of Leicester
economists
the same in other areas I think
the the effect of the activism of the
1960s and it's aftermath
has had some effect and
opening up the media and the professions
there's more critical scholarship in
many areas than there was at the time
which is
not a high bar too yes I should say but
you can get a kind of a sense of this
right
looking at a journal like the New York
reviews books probably the main Journal
of
modern liberal moderately left
intellectuals
so starting in about 1967
and nickname about
1972 a couple of years there the journal
was open to critical intellectuals I
broke there
from Sherman Paul Lauder Florence Howe
Peter Dale Scott number welders well
they're closed off
early 70s mid 70s close to him
more recent years
began to open up in some some areas so
for example you just couldn't touch
anything having to do with Israel
literally nothing couldn't say a word
until about
mid 90s or so now you can have some
critical commentary mainly by people
living in Israel and that's makes it
easier and if you look at what this is
reflecting
it's reflecting the general
mood among
religiously review try to keep a little
bit to the critical side of the general
movement late 60s early 70s was a period
of considerable activism and engagement
so it was reflected in the review
died off in the mid 70s they shifted
with him
so it continues but I think all in all
over the years I would
say that there's maybe somewhat more
opening now than there was
back in the 50s when McCarthyism was
very tight and into the 60s when you
just barely began to get some openings
it's uh I think you can easily
understand the reasons but if you take a
look at the the
academias mostly
moderately liberal
but moderately lived World means almost
completely subordinate to an official
Doctrine and ideology
can't go
millimeter Beyond and two of these
occasional exceptions that's
a reflection of the pressures of
activism and engagement most of the
students
I want to talk about the role of
liberals uh you've pointed out that they
are tolerated by the ruling capitalist
elite as long as they do not question
the virtue of the rulers or the
structural and social systems that
sustain the elites
I wonder and of course they become the
attack dogs on those who do people such
as yourself uh deliberals do more damage
than good and can you explain how
they're used to discredit critics
it's very clear
take somebody like our gen
who had an enormous impact on the
consciousness of
modern generation just opened up doors
for them that that never seen before
he was hated by the liberal intellect he
was bitter attacks on him that is a very
good interesting book by David Detmer
called
xenophobia who runs through in detail
the uh bitter attacks on Zen by liberal
historians mostly and takes them apart
and shows that they're almost total lies
and distortion
but what's interesting is about the
Savage they recorded him as a real
Danger
and went after and your phrase is
accurate like attack dogs
didn't affect the his audience of young
people
which remained but it was a severe
attack others
some of the most outstanding Scholars
um
scholarship has to recognize their
contributions are still not part of the
curriculum people like Gabriel kalka for
example one of the most outstanding
Scholars of the Cold War period which
are trying to pretty hard to find these
books a lot of people Crypt from his
books because he does amazing
scholarships and you're unlikely to find
it on a reading list and that's pretty
common
liberal intellectuals are basically
saying we're the limit of criticism
these are all good a millimeter Beyond
this
if you do that's dangerous the one thing
it affects our standing as the
courageous critics we don't want to be
exposed as
sometimes called stenographers of power
people who basically accept the
reigning ideologies and repeat them we
want to be perceived as courageous
Defenders of right and just against
Power Systems
well you know better than I do because
it's your long experience but I have the
same impression about the media too just
to give you an example and
well you may recall that after the Tet
Offensive
Freedom House
launched a huge attack against the media
two volumes
Peter greystrom
condemning the media's food
being so anti-American that they lost
the Vietnam War
they were lying about it crimes
committed by the United States
and so on well I actually went through
the two volumes
probably the only person I've written
when the volume was documentation the
other was commentary
the commentary was almost total
fabrication
there was nothing to do with the
documentation
well there's a long section of my book
with Ed Herman on manufacturing consent
the last part goes through this in
detail
what was interesting to me was the
reaction of journalists they didn't like
it
they didn't like to be defended as
honest
courageous journalists who did their job
but within the framework of the
doctrinal system
so this is an atrocity in you slaughter
a lot of some videos it's a mistake it's
not it's a normal policy
they didn't like to be told you're not
uh you're doing courageous and honorable
work
contrary to the lies that are being said
about you but you're caught within a
doctrinal framework
my impression was they very much
disliked it's
got a lot of very little comments on
them well I think that you can tell much
better than I am in other words an
accurate perception but I think it's
pretty much true of the liberal academic
word
and you can you can see it not just in
the United States it takes a England
take a look at the attack on Jeremy
corbyn it's very striking I mean Jeremy
corbyn was trying to create a labor
party
that would actually be a constituent
party
with participation
of its constituents and Authority that
would answer to their needs
the whole establishments came down on
him like a ton of bricks led by its left
liberal component with the guardian they
hated this
concocted all kind of
fanciful tales about anti-semitism
a couple of this was just recently
exposed not in England by Al Jazeera you
know you know detailed study of
documents that were came out of the late
reporting barely discussed in England
couple of words I don't want to hear it
but here's and he was actually virtually
kicked out of the labor party on totally
fraudulent charges but mainly because of
this effort to undermine establishment
liberalism by creating a genuine popular
left party with participation they don't
want then well that's kind of similar to
LDC here
you're referring to the Al Jazeera
report the labor files which is really
brilliant and of course I think shames
the British media because that should
have been their job I want to ask
whether you with a motivation for these
liberals these figures in the media in
Academia do you think it's just Craven
careerism
it's that but I think it's
it's just it's a lot easier to accept
and conform than to attack power
for obvious reasons so it's just easy to
fall into it if you're in
it starts when you're a student
you get signals saying
no
don't do this I mean you get it in the
media I'm sure you've seen it uh young
reporter gets a little too critical his
editor says that it wouldn't you take a
job visit a police reporter for a while
and come down
too critical they don't run their stuff
you can form you can move ahead and it's
the same with the young academic
if you just hang on and don't give up
you're often kicked out people like
Norman Finkelstein for example just
Woodington form
great scholar wonderful teacher can't
get a job as a job as an agile
yeah those are the kinds of pressures
there are and it's just a lot easier to
conform to them I mean the people who
are giving you these this fatherly
advice or nice people you don't want to
offend themselves
and then you internalize it becomes part
of your own beliefs
that's I think
looks like the mechanism that I see when
as I say it's got a lot more experience
in the media but I suspect it's kind of
the same
well you were unofficially blacklisted
in the New York Times I remember the
executive editor Bill Keller at one
point
in a conversation with him using your
name as a with as a kind of derogatory
slur against people in The Newsroom who
might admire your work I doubt he's ever
read a word you wrote uh I want to talk
about uh and you've been very good Lloyd
I'm per maybe the only person with the
honor of being uh informed by NPR the
liberal radio station that I'm the one
person that'll never allow to be
interviewed
right
I want to talk about and you've been
very good I lived of course as you know
overseas for 20 years and I've been
acutely aware that the way most of the
world perceives us is not how we
perceive ourselves and of course the
danger is that so much of uh foreign
policy and our relationship to the rest
of the world
is founded on these false perceptions I
wonder if you could talk about how this
works and why it's dangerous
it's interesting
toy true
we see it right now for example I mean
let's give you a couple of examples
right this minute uh take a look at the
the current issue of Foreign Affairs
Maine establishment Journal
pretty liberal pretty open by media
standards as a major article by two
leading figures Fiona Hill onto the
stand uh on the Iraq Ukraine war of
course bitterly condemning Putin is the
worst person since Hitler and so on but
it also has a big attack on the Global
cells says that they don't understand
how Noble we are they refuse to go along
with us what's wrong with him
and then comes an interesting line it
says they even sink so low that they
Dare to Compare the Russian invasion of
Ukraine with U.S intervention in Iraq
and Vietnam
I mean anybody in the global South would
be fall off their chairs when they hear
them
yeah it's true they don't it doesn't
compare because it's absolutely nothing
like them
Vietnam I mean it's the worst atrocity
since the Second World War
right yeah
violent
murders the intervention was no
justification whatsoever
but how how come they can't see that
this these were just Navy's mistakes but
when Russia does it it's the most
horrible crime since the Holocaust well
that's what let me give you another
example
there's a lot of
Euphoria and commentary
claiming that India has finally broken
with Russia and the Prime Minister the
Modi condemned
Putin at a meeting in where they had in
summer and
and the criticism it's based on
half a dozen words
they did have a conversation in which
mode he began by saying uh war is not
the way we should look for peace that's
the part that is quoted
I took the trouble of looking up his
talk on the Indian government website
it's a love letter to Putin
saying war is not the way we should work
together for peace our relations are
very warm as they've always been we
honor and respect you and we'll work
with you forever and so on all of that
got cut out
that this has been noticed by
distinguished Indian commentators but
it's the way news gets filtered through
so we can't even see what other people
think of us but this happens all the
time now there was a yellow pole a
couple of years ago
International Calico which asked the
question which country is the greatest
threat to World Peace
nobody else was even close you know it's
it's a way to way below far below was
Pakistan probably inflated by the Indian
food
Iran China the rest of them not even
meant barely even mentioned well it
wasn't recorded in the United States
you know report things have been so yeah
we don't know what other people think of
this why is this important well
we go our own way
we were exceptional we're right
there's somebody in the rest of the
world doesn't like it there's something
wrong with that but mostly we don't even
hear of them
it's just of course everybody supports
us because me so obviously right that's
how you go on for an atrocity to
atrocity
that was part one of my interview with
Professor Noam Chomsky his new book his
notes on Resistance interviews by David
barsamian I want to thank the real news
