are you good to see
you to you
something nice down
that
definitely don't
want what's the purpose of Education in
current
Society you know say now in the United
States we live in the United States so
we know the cliches about what it's
supposed to be I'm not asking that
what's the real
purpose a lot of the purpose and this
has become it's always been there but
it's uh becoming quite striking in
recent years is just a training for
obedience and Conformity actually
there's been a substantial movement
since the
1960s in this direction uh which the60s
were very frightening to Elites liberal
right-wing whoever they didn't like the
fact that too many people were just
becoming too
independent and they kind of they
focused and the literature focuses on
the crazy Fringe which existed of course
but what it tries but what really
worried them was not the crazy Fringe
but the main stream of the activism uh
which was civilizing the country it was
Raising questions that were difficult
and un wasant you know War sexism all
sorts of things and but the real problem
was people were just becoming too
independent and in fact it was so
overwhelming that they couldn't even
keep quiet about it I mean there you
talked about this before but there's a
very important book which everyone
should read by the first publication of
the trilateral commission it's the
liberal
internationalist Elite from trilateral
was Europe United States and Japan and
that's the liberal side liberal
internationalists and they were worried
about uh uh what they called excessive
democracy uh groups of people who are
usually passive and apathetic are
beginning to enter the political Arena
press their on
demands too much pressure on state we
have to dampen it down we have to have
more what they called moderation in
democracy one of the things that
concerned them very much was students
and part of the proposed this comes from
Harvard University Professor who
contributed Samuel Huntington is uh that
the problem was that U that we've been
seeing the failure of the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young their phrase now that phrase
is usually not expressed it's sort of
kept Under Wraps but there was enough
concern so it came out the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young aren't doing the job schools
unities churches the young are not being
indoctrinated properly and we have to do
something about it now that was part of
a very widespread phenomenon now runs
over to the Law and Order efforts of
Nixon it includes the drug war which was
motivated by this to a substantial
extent including mythology that was
concocted about an addicted Army and all
sorts of other things uh it shows up in
raising tuitions
and other disciplinary techniques uh for
the young to try to indoctrinate them
better it continues right to the present
on and the Obama Administration for
example it's Obama has stiffened the
extended the bush proposals of what's
called No Child Left Behind which also
came from liberals you know Edward
Kennedy and others uh No Child Left
Behind is a kind of a ISM which means
train to
test uh don't uh allow children to be
creative inventive explore and so on and
so forth make sure they pass that next
test and in fact it's pressure because
the teacher's salary depends on it and
you know a lot of pressure so uh
evaluations and so on well that's all of
us you know anyone who went to a good
school like we do did got there because
we were obedient enough to do this
idiotic kind of stuff so yeah you have a
test coming it's all crazy you memorize
what you have to memorize two days later
you forget it and then you go on you do
what you feel like I mean anyone who
hasn't had this experience is pretty
unusual but now it's it's a it's the
framework for teaching and I think it
traces back to the concern about the
failure of the institutions to
indoctrinate the young actually I can
let me give you a personal example when
I was in Mexico I happen to give a talk
at UNAM the major university you know um
couple hundred thousand students very
high quality you know good campus you
know uh it's free uh I also gave a talk
at a City College
University uh which is not only free but
it's open anybody can go um a lot of
people aren't ready to go so there's
Preparatory courses and maybe you got to
weight and so on and so forth also quite
high quality I was impressed the City
University was established by uh loers
oor sort of leftist May but it's running
it's you know nice campus doing good
things research institutes and so on all
that's Mexico poor country from there I
just happened to go to California for
talks California is maybe the richest
place in the world uh it had a great
public education system best anywhere
it's being destroyed the uh in the major
universities say Berkeley and UCLA
tuitions are going up so high uh that
it's becoming like private universities
almost and furthermore they have big
endowments and like private universities
and very likely they'll be privatized so
the kind of jewels in the crown will
become you know Harvard and Yale big uh
Elite universities the rest of the
systems meanwhile being degraded so it's
going down to the very good State system
but it's being de degraded now that's
the richest place in the world the
Mexico is one of poorer places in the
world it's not for economic reasons uh
any more than it's for economic reasons
that the uh Mexico has maybe the only
independent newspaper in the hemisphere
and we don't have them except On The
Fringe these are social and economic
decisions there all kind of reasons for
them could look into it but uh uh but
they're worth consider considering and
the educational system is
being uh constructed consciously and in
fact you know the legis you can read the
legislation and the commentary uh so as
to essentially indoctrinate that's what
training to test means I mean I can tell
you personal examples from teachers I I
even see with my grandchildren but
teachers who I've talked to have told me
that and students or parents have told
me that you know my remember recently a
parent told me that her her daughter
like I forget what maybe sixth grade or
something was interested in some topic
that came up in class and asked the
teacher about it and you know wanted to
think about it some more and teacher
said I'm sorry we can't talk about that
because we have to make sure that on
this that doesn't come up in the test
and you got to pass the test yeah I'm
sure that happens all the time okay
those are forms of indoctrination
imposing discipline and so on they've
always been there in fact you know you
go back to the origins of the one of the
really impressive things about us
educational history by comparative
standards is that the US set up a mass
public education system way before
Europe did and in fact has big research
institutes research universities which
Europe didn't have and so on so was well
in advance and a lot of the economic
industrial success of the United States
is based on it uh but even at the very
beginning during this period a large
part of the purpose of the mass
education system was to turn independent
Farmers into disciplined Factory workers
which was a big change they didn't like
it these are huge changes as there was a
lot of battles and struggles about it uh
you go back to the 19th century you know
working people regarded wage slav labor
is approximately like slavery and even
Abraham Lincoln you know it's different
for From Slavery because it's temporary
uh that was a PR was the position of the
Republican
party and that was a very common view
and to try to drive that out of people's
heads and get them to be subordinated to
big uh corporate institutions in which
they're essentially cogs in a machine
that was hard and a large part of the
industrial of the education system was
training for that that's not everything
I mean you know there's creative
teaching too
so in this view the the current
educational system while there are holes
and there you know basically it's it's
um its aim is to um indoctrinate is the
word you're using is to take they used
borrowing it right is to take the
incoming classes um to acclimate them to
boredom to make them capable of enduring
incredible boredom um obey orders follow
discipline and so on um and to be and to
be skilled at the skills that are called
for by the system that they're about to
enter okay so if and in some cases that
means that there's a small sector of
people who are going to run the system
uh out there who are conveyed certain
kinds of skills that are associated with
uh thinking and um being open-minded and
so on they're going to be the
Masters okay if that's the picture of
Education as we suff for it I guess is
the right word in the United States and
developed world and so on um what is
good education what would be a system of
Education I mean take say graduate
education in The Sciences I mean take
where I am MIT one of the reasons I've
never dreamed of going anywhere else is
because I like the culture there uh it's
a science-based university it's kind of
research oriented uh students are
expected to challenge
they're not expected to copy down what
they were told if they can get up in a
class and say I I don't I think you're
wrong I got a better idea that's good
that's it doesn't work 100% but the you
know the kind of culture is that's what
you're supposed
to cultivate and in fact that's what
good education in The Sciences is I for
pretty good reason if it wasn't that the
Sciences would die I mean they survive
on challenge creativity you know new
ideas which often come from young people
you know I mean any faculty member has
got a Grace s functioning if they don't
learn from their students there's
something wrong with them you know and
that's what education ought to be in
fact it ought to be across the
board suppose uh I know you don't like
to give advice but nonetheless uh
suppose somebody's getting out of school
and they're thinking about um becoming a
professor a professor yeah and the
person says I want to do I want to be
socially relevant I want to be
responsible I want to contribute to
Justice um is becoming a professor a
good route to follow or are the uh
pitfalls and the dangers so bad that I'm
likely to
be dysfunctional and incapable of
carrying out my will U first of all
remember that uh no human being is
solely a professional you're also a
human being
so you can be an algebraic topologist
and do extremely good work social
socially relevant work I mean take say
MIT which you remember the faculty peace
groups you know which were not very
radical but by the standards of the day
were you know kind of like off the
Spectrum we mostly from MIT faculty and
mostly scientists professional
scientists Nobel laurates you know uh
the person's asking you about becoming
an economist a sociologist a psych olist
Etc but first thing is you know to be a
professor or a carpenter or whatever you
decide to be does not exclude being a
human being so there's plenty that you
can do but suppose you want to go into a
profession that has immediate human
consequences economics sociology history
and so on it's not excluded it's going
to be hard but there are people who do
it um could you names you know there are
people who go into those professions and
do extremely good work there it's not so
easy you know you do run into the
filters and the barriers regate the
question a little bit of course it's
possible I have friends but um what does
the person need to do to protect
themselves
from what occurs 90% of the time um
which is the loss of those desires and
the following out of you know the
instructions to advance what how does
the person protect against
that by just being honest and having a
thick skin I mean you have to understand
what the reaction is going to be that
people don't like to be challenged I
mean it's the same you know it even in
the I mean Sciences are better in this
respect but even there and uh in you
know other fields literary you teaching
languages whatever it may be uh being a
professor can be a very comfortable job
I mean you can be a professor in some
ivy league university and uh do nothing
but keep rewriting your thesis you know
with sort of you know more data or you
know you dug up some more documents or
something like that you don't have to
bother thinking you don't have to bother
seeing students they never raise any
interesting questions and and you're
you're well off you know much better
paid than because are much better paid
they ought to be incling me uh and uh
it's a nice comfortable life so uh uh it
and and they're going to like it if
they're going to be challenged and
furthermore if you're say A you know an
economist and you challenge it you got a
lot of forces pressing against you not
just the uh I mean I might say you know
take say right now Obama I mean when
Obama picked his economic advisors
we're in the midst of a huge crisis we
had to pick economic advisors who' he
pick I mean did he pick Nobel laurates
who raised a couple of questions like
Joseph stiglets or Paul Krugman or
others you know not flaming radicals but
they do raise some questions and they're
no bill laurates very respected in their
field I mean not even considered what he
picked is the people who created the
crisis uh Larry Summers you Robert rman
ruin the big advisor Tim gner okay
because
you know he's in the pocket of the
financial institutions I me the ones who
put him in the power so you know he
picked people who are going to do their
job actually it's kind of interesting to
see how that worked you learn a lot
about how the political system works
just by paying some attention to what's
you know again on the front pages so
Obama you know the financial
institutions which are now pretty much
the core of the economy since big
changes took place since the 70s they
preferred him to McCain they were the
core of his funding they sort of got him
in and he's expected to work for them
naturally and that's what the advisers
were that's what the policies are you
know you bail out Goldman Sachs by
picking up the debts of AIG and you know
the whole story well you know it led to
a lot of popular
anger uh a lot of the popular anger is
seriously misdirected but the anger is
understandable I mean here we are
bailing out blank fine and those guys
the ones who created the crisis and
they're making more profits than ever
and giving out huge bonuses and so on
after we bail them out not just tarp
that's a small part of it you know they
claim they paid back tarp it's a tiny
part of it uh but uh here those guys who
created the crisis are doing great
Meanwhile we're suffering you know for
manufacturing workers it's kind of like
the Great Depression like one out of six
unemployed so you know there's anger and
Obama is a politician he had to respond
to it so U he kind of responded by
changing his rhetoric so you know
started talking about greedy bankers and
they shouldn't have big bonuses and so
on uh he was taught a lesson very fast
uh within
days the bankers and financial
institutions and others announced very
publicly you read a front page story in
the New York Times you keep talking like
that that now we're going to destroy you
we're going to drop you know we've
funded you and other Democrats we're
going to not do it we're doing it to the
Republicans that's even people are
supposed to be his friends head of JP
Morgan Chase claimed a friend of his
advisor and so said forget it you know
you try talking like that you start
talking about regulation even if you
don't mean it we're just going to get
rid of you within days Obama conceded he
gave an interview to the business press
Bloomberg News which you then saw in the
world Street Journal and elsewhere in
which he said oh you know these Bankers
are really fine guys they're my best
friends he said I speak for the American
people when I say they deserve their
bonuses because we believe in the free
market I mean is that what the American
people are saying American people wants
to turn them the shreds you know but I
speak for the American people cuz we
believe that these are great guys and
they deserve their bonuses and
everything else cuz we believe in the
free market we doesn't believe in for a
minute you know the succession of events
was kind of like a caricature of the
critique of the harshest critique of the
political system all right so this leads
into the next uh large area that I want
to talk about with you which is uh the
economy or economics I have a sequence
of questions about Economic Institutions
structures Etc um start with the most
obvious prominent one that people talk
about in your view what's wrong with
private ownership of the means of
production well here I agree with the
American working people in the 19th
century I mean wage labor is
fundamentally no different from slavery
unless it's temporary which it was for a
lot of people in the 19th century uh we
should not have uh relations of
hierarchy dominance
ordination uh centralized control over
the means of life people who give orders
applies all that yeah w i if you have
private ownership of the means of
production it means that first of all
the people it's not just one person it's
a institution so you get like maybe it's
a corporation or private business or
something first of all internally it's
essentially a totalitarian institution
almost necessarily there's a group at
the top maybe a person or a group
they make the decisions they give
orders people down the hierarchy get the
orders transmit them at the very bottom
you get people who are permitted to rent
themselves to survive that's called a
job a wage labor and you get the outside
Community who's allowed to purchase what
you produce and of course they're very
heavily propaganda does to make them
want to consume it even if they don't so
that's the nature of the system it's
kind of about as close to
totalitarianism as you can imagine and
it gets even worse because when you get
to the corporate system these are State
created
institutions given great privileges by
the state meaning you know the public to
the extent that the uh system's
Democratic I mean you can argue maybe on
technical economic grounds that it's
worth giving them those privileges but
that doesn't change the fact so I just
take the very nature of Corporations and
corporations are based on Li what's
called limited
liability uh meaning if you're a
participant in a corporation and the
corporation say carries out mass
murder is limited liability the
participants aren't guilt guilty of it
so corporate manslaughter for example is
a huge phenomenon but it's almost never
punished I give some reference a few
references on it not studied very much
okay that's a big gift that and that's
just the beginning I mean after that the
state has given massive other uh
benefits to corporations I mean it's
it's now just embedded into American law
in fact we we saw a really dramatic and
striking example in January the Supreme
Court decision on Citizens United versus
Federal electoral commission uh the
Ultra right on the court they're called
conservative but nothing to do with
conservatism the ultra right majority
appointed by Bush uh managed to railroad
through with radical judicial activism
just what they're alleged to oppose they
managed to Ram something through which
in effect grants corporations the right
to BU elections I mean they were doing
it anyway but you do it all kind of
complex and indirect ways now it says
simple you can add advertise for the
candidate you like right to the end as
much money as you want I mean when it's
discussed it said corporations and
unions but that's a bad joke so it's
corporations uh and it was the U the
decision was supported by the ACLU they
were one of the groups that I think they
presented a brief in favor of
it and uh you know I kind of understand
it in a way I mean it's based on the
idea that goes back a century that
corporations are what are called natural
entities about a century ago the courts
and the you know courts and lawyers uh
kind of shifted to a view of
Corporations which had in fact been
articulated but it was kind of like in
the background uh but that that finally
became sort of formalized a century ago
and that is that corporations though
they are State created legal entities
are natural entities meaning persons so
they're identical with persons um humans
of Flesh and Blood well humans of Flesh
and Blood have say the rights of the you
know Bill of Rights so therefore
corporations do and this already been
happening like it didn't come out of the
blue but it became kind of
institutionalized furthermore a decision
was made also by the courts that
corporations are identical with the
managers
identical so the corporation becomes
like Nots work workers and Community
forget about them but not even
shareholders it just becomes management
which means the management of a
corporation is a person with all the
rights of persons uh okay now let's and
then in later legislation becomes much
worse so the so-called free trade
agreements which don't have much to do
with free trade uh give corporations
meaning corporate management rights that
go Way Way Beyond the rights of persons
we could run through them but that's a
core part of NAFTA and the World Trade
Organization and so on so here you have
these State created entities which of
course get massive support from the
public in all sorts of ways like most of
their research and development and so on
which have rights Way Beyond persons the
management does okay now comes the
Supreme Court in January
2010 and says you the management of
Corporations can buy elections directly
and the ACLU approves because that's
free speech after for all other persons
you know persons have the right of free
speech and so of course in in fact the
the actual majority decision was
extremely
interesting the Press has noticed this
or even legal commentators but the
majority opinion written by Justice
Kennedy includes the harshest critique
of the media that I have ever seen goes
far beyond any media critics I've ever I
know of far beyond any I would have said
or n Herman or Norman Solomon or anyone
else what Justice Kennedy said is look
he said media corporations like say CBS
have the right of free speech we don't
cens censor them so therefore why
shouldn't General Electric it's just you
know they should have the right of free
speech Free Speech means money you know
so they can that's quite interesting I
mean CBS is given massive gifts from the
government like access to the public air
ways and many other things in addition
to the normal rights of a corporation on
the condition that they fulfill a public
trust the public trust is you know
convey information honestly and you know
Give opinions and so on now they're
often criticized for not meeting the
public trust which they don't but
Kennedy is saying well he probably
doesn't even understand what he's saying
he's saying they don't have a public
trust I mean they're like General
Electric well General Electric by by law
uh has a commitment namely to maximize
profit if a executive of General
Electric deviates from that he's
actually breaking the law uh so what
Kennedy is saying is you know CBS New
York Times and so on have no public
trust uh they're not supposed to prevent
news or information or anything there
nothing they're supposed to do just make
profit I mean have you ever heard a
criticism of the media anywhere near
that Arch but it kind of passed and the
ACLU approved of it uh because they're
all caught up in some crazed ideology
about these how these State created
artificial institutions are persons of
Flesh and Blood I mean you know it shows
you how I'm just barely sampling what
happened it's actually much worse than
this okay well these are you know parts
of
the parts of what's this what's parts of
what's called a free enterprise system
it's a bad joke but going back your
question you once you have a private
ownership of the means of production
that's the way it's going to go uh
almost automatically in the United
States may be more extreme than other
cases but you know the United States is
a highly class conscious business class
there were marxists if you read the
business literature it's like reading
maice red book you know values may be
inverted but the terminology is the same
and they're fighting a bitter class war
constantly they never relax for a minute
and it makes a good sense you know their
job is after all to maximize profit and
power can't criticize them for doing it
in fact they're even legally bound to do
it so can't criticize them but uh I
these are just aspects of private
Enterprise Plus the fact that they're
just based on an intolerable principle
hierarchy and
domination okay
so in the economic system that we're
most familiar with we have the private
ownership we have the hierarchies of
decision making we have the
misattribution of Rights etc etc um but
then there was this thing that came
along called Socialism or 20th century
socialism um which still exists I guess
in some in some places but has in many
other places
disappeared um what was wrong with that
depends what you mean by it first of all
the Socialist movement that came along
no I mean the actual systems that were
established you mean like stop leninism
for yeah was just another form of
tyranny one of the first things that
Lenin he didn't hide it particularly in
fact in the early 20th century you know
before the years before the Revolution
lenon was pretty harshly criticized
within the Socialist movement because of
his doctrines in fact he was criticized
I think even trosky said this because
his Doctrine is that uh there should be
a dictatorship for the proletariat
Marxist notion which to Marx meant
something quite different you know
something like producers take over
production so there should be a
dictatorship of the proletariat it
should be run by the party which is the
Vanguard the party should be run by the
Central Committee and the Central
Committee should be run by me he didn't
put in those words but essentially what
it came down to and all for the best of
reasons uh when he had it if you look at
Lennon's writings he veers away from
this in early
1917 so say from around April 19170 this
is the course of the popular revolution
you know uh he became much more
libertarian so you read April thesis
State and revolution is particularly
Anarchist text uh uh then he got power
and he went back to just what his
Doctrine was and you know among the
first Acts
were dismantle
not totally destroy but take away the
power of the
Soviets the factory councils any of the
popular institutions that developed
during the Revolutionary period uh
dismantle the constituent assembly
because there were social
revolutionaries representing peasant
interests and so on and finally turned
the place into what was actually called
a labor Army and we got to drive them to
industrialization this was all very
Progressive I mean it all comes from a
particular reading of Marx not Marx's
reading but it doesn't matter uh the
proletariat is the a agency you know the
engine of social change to freedom and
Justice and so on but that can't happen
unless we have an industrial society of
course you don't have a proletarian uh
Russia was a backward peasant Society
kind of a third world colony of the West
almost big army and stuff so unusual
third world Colony but structurally
rather like that uh and uh uh Marx
himself was very much interested in the
Revolutionary potential of the peasantry
in his last years he worked a lot on it
but all of that was kind of suppressed
by the you know the urban socialist and
like that stuff uh but uh the picture
was well we have to industrialize the
country then we'll have an urban
proletariat and then the iron laws of
history start working and you get
socialism and communism and all kind of
wonderful things all very Progressive
trosky went along with it uh and what he
developed was a tyranny for good reason
you know for principled reasons uh
Stalin turned it into a monstrosity but
I think the basic structure was already
there uh okay that's that be that's what
was called socialism now you have two
major propaganda systems in in the world
uh the hugest one by far is the Western
propaganda system you know us Britain
and so on overwhelming there's another
propaganda system after 1917 uh the
bolic propaganda system nowhere near as
powerful but you had a lot of appeal
especially in the third world you know
they were industrializing seem be
intellectuals liked it for what kind of
reasons so it did have appeal now these
two systems disagreed on a lot of things
but they agreed on one thing namely that
this is
socialism and they agreed on it for
different reasons the West agreed on it
because they wanted defame socialism say
look it's just this tyranny uh the
Bolsheviks wanted it because they wanted
to kind of profit benefit from the moral
appeal of socialism which was real now
when the world's two propaganda systems
agree on something it's kind of hard to
disentangle yourself from it so okay
this became was called really existing
socialism fact it's probably the worst
blow that socialism ever faced maybe up
till Hitler you know uh you may remember
in 1989 or so 88 roughly then
when uh Russian system was finally
collapsing I was asked by a leftist
journal to write an article on you know
what does it mean when socialism
collapses and I wrote an article I said
this is small victory for socialism if
this goes they explained why they
refused to publish it it finally
appeared in an anarchist journal in
Montreal but uh I actually wrote
something like that for the nation in a
symposium they had I don't think anybody
understood a word of what I was saying I
even the people who were strong an
stalinists and so on but I think that's
true now you know out of the Marxist
movement there came another
strain U people like U well-known people
Anon panako
gu head of the second International
educational system Carl
kch others later here like
pratic strict marxists but they had a
different
position they're very opposed to
bolshevism in fact lenon had a famous
pamphlet about them they called the
ultral left infantile something or other
well that was U kind of left you know
kind of leftwing Mark ISM wasn't very
far from anaros syndicalism in fact it
was pretty close relation a lot of these
people were very much in favor of the
Spanish Revolution uh Anarchist
Revolution but U so there was that
strain they wanted workers control in
Factory and factories you know
elimination of the party hierarchy very
anti- leninist but that was although
that was some of the leading figures in
the Marxist movement I was dispiriting I
mean who just read paner
but U you know you have okay who but in
fact the stuff didn't even reach the
West until the 1950s but U uh the uh and
then there was of course the
whole you know left libertarian
movements anarchists Naros syndicalists
all sorts of other people uh but that
didn't become socialism well socialism
became Lenin or else social democracy a
German social democracy which you know
it was kind
of reformist parliamentary social
democracy which did do things for
workers rights and women's rights and so
on so but it's within the framework of
State capitalist
democracies so that's that was socialism
but the real socialist movement was
pretty much crushed what's the word
class mean to you or the concept what do
you think it refers to what what's class
it I it has a history but uh I mean what
I'm pretty simple-minded frankly if if I
can't see something in simple terms I
understand it in these areas it's not
like science uh if you take a look at
Society there are just different roles
that people play I mean there are people
who give orders and there are people who
take orders
actually and in fact it gets
institutionalized so for example you
know take say the corporate system again
that's very stri technically
institutionalized um there are the
directors and the banks who own them and
so on and so forth they basically set
the framework they're the managers who
sort of work out how to apply things
they have their own initiative and they
give orders and they go down the line
and then there people just take orders I
mean they're not totally passive like
workers can strike and all sorts of
other things but the array of decision
making and control is fairly sharp okay
those are CL
by virtue of the position and the
economy and the roles that people play
they have different interests the PO
interests Etc use different terms for
other kinds of hierarchy and domination
so let's take a patriarchal family so
maybe the father gives the orders and
the mother follows the orders and the
kids do what they're told okay we don't
call that class no but it but it's but
that's just a terminological point and
it's another illustration of the same
kind of structural relation does that an
economic and then okay is
classlessness possible in an economy
it's kind of like asking whether slavery
is necessary you go back to the
18 well you know 18th century if you ask
people how can you have a society
without slaves I mean can you they look
around and they see them everywhere
everywhere yeah what can you do and
furthermore it's benevolent in fact like
slave owners had arguments in fact good
arguments I don't think anyone's ever
given an answer to them so slave owners
argued that they're more benevolent than
Northern manufacturers for good reasons
I mean when you own a slave you have
capital and you want to take care of
your Capital you guys the northern so
we're nice to our slaves cuz we need
them uh you guys Northern
manufacturers you don't you just rent
people you have no responsibility for
you want to throw them out you throw
them out they throw them out you get
others in fact that revealed itself very
dramatically in American history in a
period that's kind of suppressed
although we have the information I mean
if you you T you taught in school that
CL slavery ended in the Civil War it did
for about 10 years by
1877 there was a compact made by North
and South uh that the South could do
what it felt like essentially so they
reinstituted slavery but they
reinstituted in a much more brutal form
what they did is criminalized black life
so if a black man is standing on a
street corner he can be arrested for
vagrancy if he looks at a white woman he
can be arrested for attempted rape you
know or something and it didn't matter
if you're you know you were in for a $10
fee you'd never get out because you
couldn't pay the corrupt judge and you
couldn't pay the lawyer and you didn't
have any money anyway so it was
essentially permanent
servitude these criminalized
blacks were then handed over to Industry
and that's a large part of American
Industrial Development uh there was big
Southern industrialization based on
mines you know steel us steel and so on
a lot of it's just based agriculture of
course they went back right back to the
cotton fields I mean this is a large
part of American indust economic history
that's Bas and it was worse than slavery
for exactly the reasons that the slave
owners had always argued when we own
these guys we take care of them when we
just pick them up from the jails we
don't give a damn about them you know if
they die of starvation fine we got more
from the jails uh so you had a period
worse than slavery it went up to the
second world war was not small big
impact on American industrial history uh
during the second world war you needed
what's called Free Labor you know you
needed them for wartime industry so okay
there was you know black sort of got out
of the criminalized slavery and then
there was a wartime post-war boom uh
mostly B based on the state sector but
it appear it took place like the 50s and
the 60s there was big economic boom and
there were jobs for you know black men
in Auto factories and so on they pretty
decent jobs you know get a car you know
a home and so on well by the 1970s that
was over uh there were social and
economic decisions made to De
essentially de Industrial iiz the
country and turn it into a financial
center so if you go back to say 1970
the the role of the financial
institutions in GDP gross domestic
product was I don't know maybe 3% and
now it's like a third and that's changed
all sorts of things a concommitant fact
was sending industry out of the country
I mean two years ago the head of
IBM gomy I think testified before
Congress interesting testimony what he
said is you know in the earlier years
what was good for American corporations
was good for the country because you get
jobs and so on and so forth he say now
it's not true anymore what's good for
the corporation is bad for the country
and IBM is a perfect example I think
they have like 70% of their employees in
India not not not just I mean the ones
that they hire themselves you know
they're overseas you can take a row Boo
and go out to your job and this is
striking in the case of I M because the
the corporation exists thanks to huge
public subsidies I mean that's how
computers were developed and on and on
so here they are a corporation that
exists thanks to Fantastic public
subsidies uh for their own economic
reasons it's better to move production
overseas you know uh dell for example is
one of the biggest exporters from China
and so it goes but uh so it's not even a
pretense anymore that what's good for
the corporation good for the country
okay all this happened the result is
that for say poor working people which
mean's heavily black later Hispanic
there's no jobs so what do you do throw
them to jail just like U after
reconstruction that's the main reason
the level of criminalization in the you
know of incarceration in the United
States is shot out of sight around 1980
was kind of like other industrial
countries now
maybe 10 times as high as most of them
it's mostly Black and Hispanic on sort
of drug charges you know kid was picked
up with a joint or something and they
become slave labor again uh they're
farmed out to corporations you know uh
in fact often private jails which is
against International regulations but it
happens anyway so it's kind of like a if
you take a look at the whole history of
African-Americans that's approximately
what it is well okay going back to the
question why be opposed to slavery no
that wasn't a question question is is
classlessness possible well was slavery
possible and was it possible to get rid
of slavery it was possible but there are
a lot of pressures that prevent it so
technically we didn't have slavery after
1877 but in practice we did upshot that
you want to communicate that while it's
maybe possible to get rid of
classlessness it's pretty much hopeless
I'm getting rid of getting rid of formal
slavery was progress I mean blacks are
better off than when they were slaves so
yes it's Improvement but the kind of
improvements you can make remember that
the people who own and manage the
society are going to fight back they're
not going to give up right so you got to
keep struggling can we eliminate class
in other respects sure why not why can't
workers run factories in fact live issue
right now these issues are just below
the surface right now so let's be
concrete
uh there's an economic crisis and
there's an environmental crisis and it's
agreed across the board that one way the
United States has to try to deal with
this is to overcome our hopelessly
backward infrastructure backward as
compared with Europe and Japan so we
have terrible trans transportation
system was designed that way it was
designed in you know like massive social
engineering projects after the war to be
highly uh inefficient in efficient from
the point of VI of moneymaking but uh
based basically on wasteful use of
fossil fuels that's why you have
suburbanization you know destroy the
railroads and so on and so forth major
State corporate projects all right
that's now kind of like can't go on you
know we got to sort of at least catch up
to the rest of the industrial world so
you need highspeed rail okay how do you
get highspeed rail well Obama sends his
Transportation secretary to Spain uh so
that he can use federal stimulus money
meaning taxpayer money to buy to make
contracts in Spain for Spain you know
it's like not some superpower to provide
us with High-Speed Rail at the very same
time Obama is continuing to follow the
de-industrialization policies from the
1970s you know closed down GM plants and
so on and so forth it's kind of like
couldn't couldn't imagine a
more massive criticism of the
socioeconomic system destroying a
factory doesn't just mean destroying the
factory means destroying the workforce
you know the community the community is
usually built up around the factories
and so on well there's an answer the
people in those factories could take
over the plants them themselves convert
them to High-Speed Rail production it's
a task but not an insoluble one like
conversion of American industry to
wartime production in the 1940s was a
far bigger task and was done very
successfully it might need some
Community Federal support okay a
fraction of what's paid to the banks so
it's it's barly
feasible uh it uh it has to at least be
in Consciousness you it has have to at
least be able to think about it and then
to proceed to do it and it's not
impossible there have been Ste there are
first of all there are examples of it
you know scattered through the country
there are such examples and there are
cases which came pretty close to working
the most important one I know is uh uh
in Ohio
Youngstown about 30 years ago I guess
Youngstown Steel the town was sort of
based around the steel industry it's
steel town us steel decided to move
somewhere else there were a lot of
protests I mean strikes you know I think
there were even sit Downs you know a lot
of community protest and finally uh an
effort led by ston Lind radical lawyer
uh it went to try to take it to the
courts so that to try to get the courts
to agree that the uh soal stakeholders
you know the community and the workforce
could take over the
corporate institution that was being
dismantled and I went to the courts and
they finally lost in the courts not for
any economic reason now they lost
because they didn't have enough public
support you know if they had enough
public support it could have won well
you know those things are you know
they're right they should be on
everyone's fingertips right at this
minute because that's what's happening
in the country I mean if we want high
speed rail and we don't have to go to
Spain to buy it with taxpayer money uh
American workers are have the skills and
the ability and the managerial capacity
and so on to do it themselves uh but
okay that would be a from some point of
view that's a reformist measure from
another point of view it's a very
radical measure it's a move towards
eliminating class
society and it you know it's not that
Utopia these things the biggest obstacle
is the absence of Consciousness
organization uh
would say that the biggest obstacle is
the other side is an obstacle yeah they
give away they're of course an obstacle
sure they're going to fight problem
they're going to fight to hold what they
own but that's true of everything I
that's why the business classes have
been fighting like mad to get rid of
something like say social
security okay
um do you have any I don't know whether
to call it advice what do you think
activist seeking a better economy might
usually Focus their enemy energies on
you just answered that in some sense as
one example
and you think any serious mistakes have
been made in left approaches to the
economy um that should be corrected well
the biggest mistake is
non-existence it's very hard to find
left approaches to the economy in any
like except for very small groups you
know or I mean sometimes large number of
people but you know not organized for
activism so yeah that these popular
forces have to be created I mean there
there's experience after all uh even in
American history like say take the
1920s in the 1920s the labor movement
was basically destroyed woodro Wilson
again the great idealist he played a
major role in destroying the unions
which he hated uh and uh but it was
pretty dead in fact there's a famous
book of Labor history by David
Montgomery one of the great Labor
historians called uh the rise and fall
of the American labor movement or
something like that and by the fall he
means the 1920s it was pretty much gone
so much gone that
right-wing Europe in British newspapers
couldn't believe how workers are
oppressed here they're killed and so on
well you know it changed in the
1930s big revitalization but not
fast the uh Depression hit in
1929 it wasn't until around five or 6
years later that you really got
substantial labor organiz in CIO
organizing for example and some
radicalization of the
AFL uh and you got to the point where
you had sitdown strikes sitdown strikes
are frightening sitdown strikes are one
step before taking over the factory so
as soon as that started
happening uh business got nervous uh New
Deal legislation got passed valuable
legislation but a large part of it was
just GR damp down what's going on
uh we're not five years into this
recession yet it could happen of course
there were things then existed that
don't exist now uh one of them which
we're not allowed to talk about was that
there was a Communist party uh now you
know the Communist party was all tied up
with Stalin worship but for most people
in the party here that didn't mean much
I mean I can remember it is my personal
experience now like my aunts and uncles
who were you know unemployed workers
were in the Communist party and they'd
say the right words about Russia but
they didn't give a damn what happened in
Russia they were interested in uh unions
and civil rights you know rights for
blacks workers rights and you know
getting a vacation and a union uh
establishment all that's what they were
interested in and in fact the Communist
party was right in the Forefront of
almost anything that was happening
whether it was civil rights you
know rights for black Union organizing
and so on well that was
crushed U we call it mcarthism but
started before that because the idea
that you could have a militant
radical worker-based force was
intolerable to American power liberals
conservatives anyway but uh and that
doesn't exist now but it can be
reconstructed some other terms without
worship of some foreign
power all right you want to take a a
pause
okay all right see you later
