foreign
first of all I would like to thank so
much
no Chomsky
for having making the time to talk about
Julian Assange with us it's of extreme
importance his voice
in particularly within Americans
but he has also inspired so many people
internationally like me from the middle
of nowhere of Brazil I have his books
and I know who he is so his voice is has
a enormous capularity and is a voice of
Hope for many generations very pleased
to be with you
so
um the first question that I have to ask
is
Julian Assange could be extradited
in a few weeks time
if the English Supreme Court refuses to
hear his appeal
Julian Assange has never been charged
with any crime in the UK
and its tradition treaty between the UK
and USA prohibits its tradition for the
so-called political offense under which
Assange has been charged
so Mr Chomsky how do you analyze the
role of the British courts in this
extraditions proceedings so far the
British courts have behaved
much as the British government has
throughout
basically from the demands of the United
States
there is a
if you want to get into the
legalistic details which I frankly don't
think are very relevant but if you want
to get into them then there is a
question technical equipment
question about whether he's being
charged with a political crime
or whether he's being charged with a
technical crime about
using a password illegitimately and so
on which is what of course the lawyers
will claim but the fact of the matter
quite apart from the legal maneuverings
which are the cover fling the fact of
the matter is he's being
charged with the S the charge is that he
released information
that major newspapers used but that the
U.S government wants to
impressed you can cloak that in all
kinds of
legalistic
chicanery but that's what lies at the
heart of it
there was no the British government had
no justification for effectively
imprisoning him for years
on the Ecuadorian Embassy
apparently what he was charged with was
a triviality not paying bill on time but
for that he was essentially locked into
it
an apartment which is what the embassy
is uh couldn't go outside
surrounded by police
all of this is outrageous behavior being
put in a top security prison it's
another outrage
the U.N repertoire on torture was quite
correct to call it the administration of
torture
so there's two those
on which you can do this one is the
technical level of the exact nature of
the crime for which the U.S government
charging him the other is what's really
happening it's the second that's
important
Mr Chomsky from your analysis do you
think
is there any chance for Julian Assange
to win this case legally in the British
courts depends how
narrow the
U.S charges or
so for example if he's charged under the
Espionage Act
then this basically is blatantly
unconstitutional
it has never come before the courts uh
to evaluate it s constitutional status
but for over a century it's been applied
freely extensively
uh President Obama went beyond all
previous
presidents combined and his users of it
to control the information
but it's
if there was a honest serious Supreme
Court
they would never allow it to be to stand
because it's so
blatantly in violation of fundamental
constitutional principles but that has
nothing to do with it whether it can
succeed in the courts
that was a separate matter
you know the law has its own ways of
proceeding and if the charges are framed
very specifically and narrowly by
careful legal experts they will try to
shape it so that it doesn't look like a
political crime technical matter like
using a password and it shouldn't or
something like that that's what lawyers
are pays for do you consider that the
case of Assange is a cage of law fair is
it a case of lawfare
security of using the technicalities of
law
in order to punish someone who has
committed
of releasing
to the citizens of the United States
information that they have a right to
have and should have and that the
government wants to keep Secret
that's the issue there's a background
issue it's been
stated in many ways over the years when
professor of
politic government at Harvard University
Samuel hunting power remains effective
when it is in the dark
exposed to the sunlight begins to
evaporate well
Julian Assange exposed power to the Sun
to the sunlight
powerful systems don't want to see their
power
evaporated so therefore they can cloak
this in legalistic language or two
uh distort what's happening but that's
the essence of it
and Wikileaks she editor-in-chief
Christine Robson he was received by
president-electa Lula less than a week
ago and had no excitations he called in
Assange previously as a hero and he
offered to WikiLeaks full support in
Assange scores
a day later
Prime Minister of Australia Albanese he
breaks his silence and for the first
time as a prime minister declares that
the persecution against Assange must end
so a breakthrough because Australia has
been very quiet so far
do you think it's a coincidence or those
two facts are related I think it's uh
not really a coincidence there is
a widespread
condemnation of the
uh where assassin has been treated and
of the impending extradition
so there are no voices speaking out
against it including the five major
journals which used
Wikileaks material extensively and I
must say have a pretty poor record
themselves as the way they've dealt with
this but they finally came out with the
joints
State not adequate but fine
case of openness is very significant
as of course is an Australian City
Australia has not stood up for his
rights as they should have all along one
leading Australian
strategic analyst political commentator
code
sub Imperial power subordinated to the
United States
doesn't step on the toes of the master
quoting
and there's a leading analyst and
political scientists in Australia but
finally of Vanessa made a mild statement
which is
better than nothing but should be much
stronger
Lula's statement is very important he
has
Prestige rightly and to throw his weight
into this controversy is a positive sign
so um I'd like to turn back over to
president Lula so we all know what these
elections means to Brazil it's the
possibility it's a turning point in
history where Lula has won a Hebrews
Warfare and there is the possibility for
the country to recover democracy again
so but I would like to know what you
think the Lulu's elections May mean for
a world where the far Riders are still
on the rise Brazil is
the most important country of Latin
America of course
so what happens in Brazil has much
broader implications but
do those
victory in the several examples of steps
towards
reversing the
right winged
motivation years
uh Pedro in Colombia is in other work in
Chiles and other the this election
and I think we'll strengthen their hands
so there is uh
Fernandez known of Argentina that's a
conflict is a constant conflict Latin
America and the days of extreme
importance in uh
carrying this forward
so I think
he's facing serious
obstacles and problems but uh the
his election
is a powerful significant
figured and I think he can make a very
positive contribution towards bringing
Latin America moving it in a more
Progressive Direction so my last
question to you Jay what do you think
would be the main challenges that Lula
May face at International level
internally we think it's the financial
Capital who already uses Global TV
to oppression the government but at the
international level what are the
challenges for Lula
in your view
there are plenty of internal challenges
or the
country is split
Brazil
almost 50 50. well there's strong
internal forces that are strongly
opposed to the passionately opposed
uh
large part of the population in the
Evangelical churches
includes working people in the
areas where illegal logging and
destruction of the Amazon is their
source of support
a couple of provinces that bolsonaro won
with were in class award uh destruction
of the Amazon is
total disaster for Brazil and
catastrophe for the world but uh poor
people who have nothing
accept the chance to make a little money
by cutting wipes from the Amazon don't
see it that way they don't want to
believe it they'll just go ahead they
were logging mining agribusiness
uh forces that are strongly opposed to
the other
Conservative Business
Community is
kind of split not like Lulu's policies
on the other hand they don't like full
scenarios and craziness which is
significant in the United States where
the investment community
basic capitalist community supports
the Republican Party policies but don't
like Trump is disruptive influence
they'd rather have somebody who
supports their carries through
interest in a in a
polite and on a disruptive Manner and I
think the same is true in Brazil That's
internally then there's internationally
the International Investment community
very much favors proceeding
Administration which was extreme
it is the minister economy very simply
is it just privatize everything I mean
give everything in Brazil away give it
away
a private Capital International Capital
so they can enrich themselves it's
called neoliberalism so naturally they
like them every work in the interest of
the poor the stock market collapses it
all goes down those are the same in
Colombia Saint Julie I assume anywhere
is there any popular any forces
concerned with the interopulational race
of their voices same in the west take
England all right talk what happened to
Jeremy corbyn soon
[Music]
Jeremy Corbin came along and tried to
turn the labor party into an authentic
political Authority formation of policy
and where the party policies would be
designed
in the answers of working people in the
poor
extremely successful 2017 labor under
his leadership had the biggest Victory
it's had in memory that the
establishment across the board all the
way to the guardian came down on him
but
I've been scraping the bottom of the
barrel and inventing ways to defame him
and destroy him they were simply not
going to tolerate the political
organization that actually responds to
the needs of working people in the poor
and is not under the control of
politically leads so they virtually
destroyed him in fact he's been
almost expelled from the big reported
for trying it
if this they were similar attacks
against Bernie Sanders in the United
States not quite as Extreme as managed
to survive that any
moderately
Progressive reformist force and we'll
face the latinarian in fact the rest of
the world
we're engaged in constant class war
constantly
the Masters never remained
of fighting that are class war that's
with neoliberalism is any attempt to
confront it from the concentration of
wealth and power in the ownership
investor class Professor Chomsky thank
you so much for giving you giving us
your time and to talk about Julian
Assange a political prisoner maybe the
most important political prisoners of
the west of our times we greatly
appreciate
that your support thank you so much
thank you pleasure to be with you
