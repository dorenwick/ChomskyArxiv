[Applause]
thank
you uh
there have been uh clearly quite
significant changes in Global Order
they're underway right now but before
turning through them I'd like to say
just a word about the fact that uh they
may not continue for very long there's
an unfortunate reason uh the reason you
all know I'm sure uh is that for the
first time in human history
we are facing U
realistic questions of species survival
at least in any decent form uh that
concern is not new but unfortunately
nothing much has been done about it uh
over half a century ago uh in July
1955 to of the greatest figures of the
20th century Bertrand Russell and Albert
Einstein
issued an extraordinary appeal to the
people of the world uh to face a choice
that in their words is Stark and
Dreadful and
inescapable shall we put an end to the
human race or shall mankind renounce War
uh Russell and Einstein were of course
thinking of nuclear war uh there have
been many very close calls since it's
kind of a miracle that
species has survived this far uh and
they continue in fact even in recent
weeks if there's time I may say
something about them uh and there's a
companion threat which they didn't
realize at the time but it's now
understood that's environmental disaster
it's meeting in Bon right
now that almost certainly will have no
outcome that is supposed to deal with it
uh the threat of environment disaster
was highlighted by a report last week
from the International Energy agency a
report was that the greenhouse gas
emissions had increased by a record
amount last year despite the recession
and that the chances are now quite slim
for holding global warming to a 2Â° cels
level that's considered to be the
threshold for for really dangerous
climate change and we may have passed it
I'll return briefly to both of these
matters uh merely noting that they cast
a dark shadow over any discussion of
Global Order well let's put those Grim
prospects to the side and consider the
evolving Global Order uh one major theme
widely discussed is what's called
American
decline it's real but I think it's
sometimes
misinterpreted it's commonly described
as another stage in a long-term shift of
global hegemony from east to west uh
crossing the Atlantic then now moving
across the Pacific to the rising Powers
China and India and their recent growth
is indeed spectacular
but I think this is an error of
interpretation and though there is a
significant Global shift I think it may
be different than this one
well proceeding to approach that let's
look back briefly to the evolution of
the Contemporary Global Order beginning
with World War II when it made a huge
change uh the changes and continuities
since that time are significant there
very real and they're quite instructive
it's worth thinking about them uh from
the outset of the war in
1939 uh Washington anticipated that the
war would end uh in with the United
States in a position of overwhelming
power there were highlevel meetings
right through the war 1939 to
1945 uh high level government officials
and
non-governmental foreign policy
Specialists they meant to lay out plans
for the post-war World they delineated
what they called a grand area that the
US was going to
dominate uh and it included the entire
Western Hemisphere the entire Far East
uh and the former British Empire which
the US would take over including
crucially its uh
Middle East energy
reserves uh as Russia began to grind
down the Nazi armies after
Stalingrad a grand area planning changed
the goals expanded to include as much of
Eurasia as possible at least its
economic core in Western Europe and
within the grand area there were certain
policies which still hold simply read
them within the grand area the United
States would maintain unquestioned power
with military and economic Supremacy and
it would ensure the limitation of any
exercise of sovereignty by states that
might interfere with its Global
designs uh these are doctrines that
still Prevail though the ability to
impose them has declined it's very clear
from the documentary record that uh
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the postwar world I'm
quoting the accurate assessment by one
of the leading diplomatic historians
British historian Jeffrey Warner one of
the major Specialists on the topic and
much more significant the uh careful
wartime plans were very soon implemented
in thoughtfully and in great detail
uh and it's not surprising that the US
had those plans at that time the United
States was in a position of historically
unprecedented power it had literally 50%
of the world's wealth at an incomparable
security controlled the Western
Hemisphere controlled both oceans it
controlled the opposite sides of both
oceans uh State Department planning
which was largely in the hands of George
Kennan the head of the State Department
planning staff uh it assigned to each
region of the world what they called its
function uh in Latin
America uh the function was to fulfill
the Monro doctrine of
1823 the doctrine announced that the US
would dominate the hemisphere but
couldn't be implemented at the time the
British were much too powerful but after
the second world war you could implement
me the Monro doctrine that was our
little region over here as the Secretary
of War Henry Stimson explained while
demanding that all regional alliances be
dismantled except for our own which
would be
expanded uh the function of Southeast
Asia was to provide resources and raw
materials to the former Colonial
Masters uh the United States had little
interest in Africa at the time so Kenan
assigned Africa to Europe to exploit
it's his word for Europe to exploit for
its reconstruction you could imagine a
different relation between Europe and
Africa in the light of history but that
wasn't considered uh as for Europe
itself it was to be
reconstituted but in a very specific way
it was to be reconstituted only after
Labor and the left were U suppressed
that's the core of the anti-fascist
resistance of course they had to be
suppressed and the traditional order had
to be reestablished including fascist
collaborators uh that sometimes required
considerable violence and large scale
subversion continued for many years in
Italy it continued well into the 1970s
uh for Germany uh it was necessary I'm
quoting to
veto uh um the major Union constitutions
to forcefully terminate social
experiments to Bar early codetermination
efforts and more generally to wall off
the Western Zone from the East that was
Canon's interesting phrase uh planners
were were concerned that they would not
be able to compete with social and
economic uh uh pressures coming from the
East so therefore Western Germany had to
be walled off uh that meant left labor
influences and they were very explicit
about it uh then later came the Marshall
Plan which doubtless aided European
reconstruction but it had other goals as
well uh in reality the Marshall plan if
you look at what happened it was very
largely a taxpayer subsidy US taxpayer
subsidy to us businesses most of the
money never left the United States and
that's appreciated by the uh
beneficiaries in the United States the
domestic beneficiaries so Ronald
Reagan's Commerce Department pointed out
that in their words the Marshall Plan
set the stage for a larger amounts of
private us direct investment in Europe
uh laying the groundwork for the rise of
multinational corporations at that time
almost all American uh Business Week the
main Business Journal described
multinational corporations as the
economic expression of the political
framework expressed by established by
postwar policy makers in which American
Business PR ered and expanded on
overseas orders fueled initially by the
dollars of the Marshall Plan and
protected from negative developments by
the umbrella of American power that's
1975 uh it was always recognized that
Europe might choose to follow an
independent course perhaps along gist
lines and uh NATO was partially intended
to counter that threat and that was seen
very clearly in uh when the in 1989 1990
when the official pretext for NATO
dissolved official pretext NATO's there
to protect Western Europe from the
Russian hordes no more Russian hordes uh
anyone who believed the propaganda of
the preceding years should have expected
that NATO would
dissolve uh on the contrary it was
expanded to the east in violation of
very explicit pledges but only verbal
pledges to Gorbachev who was pretty
upset when they were violated but the
Washington pointed out to him that the
pledges weren't on paper and if he was
stupid enough to accept the gentleman's
agreement that's his problem uh so in
violation of the pledges expanded to the
East and since then it's been expanded
well beyond it's now a uh officially a
us-run global intervention Force its
official task is controlling The crucial
infrastructure of the global Energy
System pipelines sea lanes and so on uh
nevertheless uh what's called American
declinism set in very quickly the grand
area began to unravel very seriously by
1947 uh with What's called the loss of
China which is an interesting term it's
the term constantly used debates about
who's responsible for the loss of China
and the phrase is worth thinking about
that you can only lose what you possess
and legitimate ownership of the world is
just taken for granted uh it's not
surprisingly given given the scale of us
power uh southeast Asia began to go the
same way
first in Indochina but much more
seriously in Indonesia much more
valuable prize uh in
1958 President Eisenhower carried out
the largest
intervention uh in post in since World
War
II uh the goal was to support a military
Revolt over throwing the government the
idea was to split off the outer Islands
that's where most of the resources are
that failed but in
1965 there was a us-backed military coup
in uh
Indonesia which uh installed the
dictatorship of General
suara uh it carried it out with a
staggering
bloodbath that was a gleam of light in
Asia in the words of the New York Times
hundreds of thousands of people were
slaughtered mostly landless peasants and
the country was thrown open to Western
exploitation Euphoria in the West Was
virtually
unconstrained uh years later MC George
Bundy who was the National Security
advisor for presidents Kennedy and
Johnson he
reflected uh in retrospect that the
United States should probably have
called off the Vietnam War in 19
65 since the major objective had been
achieved uh the major objective we know
from Declassified documents was to
prevent What's called the virus of
independent nationalism from spreading
contagion to the rest of the region uh
possibly even Japan was called the super
Domino by the eminent Asia historian
John Da the fear of
contagion from the virus of independent
nationalism that's the terminology later
of Henry Kissinger Nixon Administration
that's a leading theme of post-war
history one of the major themes in fact
well our little region over here Latin
America that posed similar dangers early
on in
1954 uh the United States overthrew the
first democratic government in Guatemala
installed a brutal dictatorship that
carried out horrendous crimes ultimately
a virtual genocide of the Mayans and the
highlands is still fleeing to the United
States all with the strong support of
the Reagan
Administration but the contagion
nevertheless spread uh in
1962 President Kennedy shifted the
mission of the Latin American Military
which of course the United States can do
that shifted the mission from
hemispheric defense which was a kind of
a hold over from World War II to
internal security internal security has
a very definite meaning means war
against the population brutal War and
the consequences are described by uh
Charles meling he's the man who led
counterinsurgency and internal defense
planning in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations now he described
Kennedy's 1962 decision I'll quote him
as a shift from toleration of the
rapacity and cruelty of the Latin
American Military to direct complicity
in their crimes to us support for the
methods of hinr himmler's extermination
squads uh just recently Cambridge
University press published a academic
history of the Cold War uh Latin
American one of the contributions is by
Latin American Scholar John John
coatsworth and he wrote writes that from
that time the early 60s to the Soviet
collapse in
1990 quoting the numbers of political
prisoners torture victims executions of
nonviolent political denters in Latin
America vastly exceeded those of the
Soviet Union and its East European
satellites U all supported sometimes
instituted by Washington that included a
long series of religious Martyrs and
Mass Slaughter as well the last major
violent Act was
uh a week after the Berlin
wallf brutal assassination of six
leading Latin American American
intellectuals Jesuit priests uh the
perpetrators were an elite Salvadoran
Battalion which already had left a trail
of thousands of brutally murdered
victims they had just come from renewed
training at the John F Kennedy School of
special
Warfare uh and they were acting on
Direct we now know on direct orders of
the high command of the US client state
which was in always close contact with
Washington while the consequences of
this hemispheric plague uh still of
course
reverberate uh from the wartime years in
fact since the dawn of the oil age back
during the first World War uh control of
the Middle East was regarded as a very
high priority in President Eisenhower's
judgment the Middle East was the most
strategically important are of the
world uh it was a stupendous source of
strategic power probably the richest
economic prize in the world in the field
of foreign investment that's the
Judgment of the state department in the
1940s and that was a prize that the
United States intended to keep for
itself and its allies in the unfolding
New World Order of that day well
problems also arose there very early in
in the oil producing regions in
1953 the United States and Britain uh
overthrew the Parliamentary regime of
prime minister mad in Iran installed the
data dictatorship of the Sha and the
general reaction of liberal intellectual
Elites was expressed very clearly by the
New York Times
editors uh quote underdeveloped
countries with Rich resources now have
an object lesson in the heavy cost that
must be paid by one of their number
which goes perer with fanatical
nationalism uh it's too much to hope
that Iran's experience will prevent the
rise of madex in other countries but
that experience May at least strengthen
the hands of more reasonable and more
farseeing leaders
who will have a cleare eyed
understanding of the principles of
Decent Behavior Decent Behavior means
you follow us orders and you don't try
to take over your own resources that's
the liberal Progressive end of the
spectrum go to the right gets
harsher uh consequences of that are too
well known to review well that's the
mest sketch of implementation of grand
area policies in What's called the
global South the preferred version of
the post-war era era is quite different
it's actually expressed quite well by
the lead article in the current issue of
Britain's Prime foreign policy Journal
International Affairs it discusses I'll
quote it the Visionary International
order of the second half of the 20th
century marked by the
universalization of an American Vision
of commercial
Prosperity well there's something to
that account but it does not quite
convey the perception of those who are
at the wrong end of the
guns uh and that's typical of Western
ideological pronouncements called
scholarship and journalism and so on uh
Grand area Doctrine restricts the
sovereignty of others but it grants the
United States unrestricted rights among
these is the right to carry out
unilateral military intervention at will
and that Doctrine has repeatedly been
articulated for example by the Clinton
Administration uh it explained that the
US has the right to use military force
unilaterally to ensure I'm quoting
uninhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources and the
US must maintain military forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
shape people's opinions about us not by
handing out chocolate bars and to shape
events that will affect our livelihood
and our security and notice that that
the Clinton Doctrine was considerably
more extreme than the Bush Doctrine the
Bush Doctrine received a lot of
criticism but more because because of
the style and the content that Clinton
presented it politely pleasant words and
so on the Bush Administration presented
it with extreme arrogance and European
leaders don't like to be insulted they
don't mind the doctrine in fact they
accept it but uh present it to us
politely please uh the same principles
uh governed the invasion of
Iraq uh after a few years it was
becoming quite clear that the United
States was unable to uh impose its will
in Iraq and at that point the actual
goals of the invasion couldn't be
concealed any longer behind the usual
pretty rhetoric in November
2007 the White House issued what they
called a declaration of principles which
insisted that US forces must remain
indefinitely in Iraq free to carry out
combat operations and that Iraq must
privilege American
investors two months later January 2008
President Bush informed Congress that he
would reject legislation that might
limit the permanent stationing of us
armed forces in Iraq or Us control of
the oil resources of
Iraq very explicit all of this of course
had been concealed before you know nice
rhetoric about democracy the usual these
were demands that the United States had
to abandon uh in the face of Iraqi
resistance that was another step in a
major defeat it's quite unlike Vietnam
where the US did achieve its major aims
that as was recognized by MC George
Bundy for
example well throughout these years
despite many successes American
declinism continued uh by
1970 the US share of global wealth had
declined to about
25% still enormous but much less than
the post-war height of 50% of the other
industrial Powers had recovered with
considerable assistance from us violence
so the Korean war was a major stimulus
to Japan's recovery uh and U the Vietnam
War gave it another significant boost U
it also helped to spark South Korea's
remarkable development from the level of
a poor African state to a leading
industrial power substantial share of
south of Kore South Korea's Foreign
Exchange in the 1960s came from
mercenaries vicious brutal mercenaries
that they were Supply providing for the
American war in Viet viam hundreds of
thousands of them uh
decolonization was proceeding following
its agonizing course uh by 1970 the
industrial world was described as bipol
tripolar three North America Western
Europe and East Asia at that time Japan
based and already beginning to become
the most dynamic industrial region of
the
world well one revealing index of the
decline of us power is vetos at the
United Nations until 1965 there were
none the world was under control and the
UN in fact could be used as a weapon
against the Soviet Union uh since
1965 the United States is far in the
lead in vetos on a very wide range of
issues Britain is second and no one else
is even close
uh in the
1970s there were also quite radical
changes in the entire State capitalist
system with the twin processes of uh
financialization of the economy and for
the US the offshoring of production
these effects have been substantial and
they've contributed to a
self-inflicted acceleration of American
decline I'll return to that uh decline
has continued in the New Millennium very
dramatic developments have taken place
in our little region over here in the
past decade for the first time in 500
years since the days of the European
conquerors the countries of South
America have begun to deal with their
terrible internal
problems uh ruled by a small
europeanized often white elite with
enormous wealth these are just little
islands and a sea of miserable poverty
uh they've begun to deal with it uh and
they've also begun to move towards
integration that's a prerequisite for
Independence that the US has been
expelled from all of its military bases
in South
America uh one symbol of the uh current
developments is the formation
of an organization celac which includes
all states of the Western Hemisphere
apart from the US and Canada that would
have been Unthinkable before its first
meeting is scheduled in a few weeks and
if it becomes operational that'll be
another step in undoing the Monroe
Doctrine well control of Latin America
was always considered a Cornerstone of
global dominance
uh one dramatic moment was under the
Nixon Administration When It Was
preparing for the overthrow of Chilean
democracy the National Security Council
planning board observed that if the
United States could not control Latin
America it could not expect to achieve a
successful order elsewhere in the world
that is to control the rest of the world
uh Washington's credibility would be
undermined Henry Kissinger put it he was
planning the overthrow of
the democratic government the concern as
Kissinger explained was that others too
might separate themselves from us
control if the Chilean virus was not
destroyed before it could spread
contagion his phrase he was actually
concerned with southern Europe he
thought that was the period of what was
called
eurocommunism kind of Social Democratic
movements in Spain and Italy and
Kissinger was concerned that the Chilean
virus might spread contagion there he
didn't expect the Chilean Army to land
in Rome but he was afraid that the model
might Inspire others actually bref
shared that concern at the time for
other reasons uh therefore parliamentary
democracy in Chile had to go that
actually happened on what in Latin
America is often called the first
911 September 11th
1973 that's gone from history in the
west that though in terms of the
consequences for chile and the whole
region it far outweighs the terrible
crimes of what we call 9/11 September
11th
2001 well important as um Latin America
was for World control
it paled alongside the Middle East I've
already mentioned some assessments of
its significance at the dawn of the
post-war age uh despite all the changes
since it's there's every reason to
suppose that today's policy makers
basically adhere to the Judgment of very
influential Roosevelt advisor AA Burley
who observed that control of the Inc
operable energy reserves of the Middle
East would yield substantial control of
the world and
correspondingly uh notice that that
doesn't mean access to the resources in
fact they didn't much care about that
that's control very different matter uh
correspondingly the loss of that control
would threaten the project of global
dominance that was very clearly
articulated during World War II and has
been sustained in the face of major
changes in World Order ever since that
day but that's being threatened too
right now us dominance in um in that
region is under severe threat that's the
Arab Spring uh the Arab world is
beginning to move in the same direction
as Latin America in the uh past decade
uh that's the Democratic uprising of the
Arab Spring and and the US and its
Western allies are sure to do whatever
they can to prevent authentic democracy
in the Arab world it's very important to
understand and to understand why it's
sufficient to uh take a look at the
studies of Arab public opinion these are
conducted by the most respected uh us
polling agencies in the United States
they not reported at all barely
mentioned elsewhere you can tell me
whether the reported here but they're
certainly known to
planners uh they reveal that by
overwhelming majorities uh Arabs regard
the United States and Israel as the
major threats they face uh 90% in Egypt
most important country in the region now
there are some in the Arab world who
think of Iran as a threat
10% uh opposition to US policy is so
strong that a majority in the Arab world
believe that security would be improved
if Iran had nuclear weapons to deter the
United States in Egypt that's 80% of the
population and other figures are pretty
much similar well the conclusion is that
uh if public opinion were to influence
policy as would happen if there's any
serious move towards democracy then the
United States would not only not control
the region but it would be expelled hel
from it along with its allies that would
undermine fundamental principles of
global
domination uh the contempt of elite
opinion for democracy was revealed very
dramatically uh in the reaction to the
Wikileaks exposures the ones that
received most attention euphoric
commentary were cables reporting that
Arabs support the US stand on Iran the
reference was to the ruling dictators
the attitudes of the public were
unmentioned uh so it's enough if the
dictators support us doesn't matter the
public is radically opposed and there is
a guiding principle that was articulated
pretty clearly by the Middle East
specialist of the Carnegie endowment
Marwan moer it's formerly a high
official of the Jordanian dictatorship
the principle is there's nothing wrong
everything's under control in short if
the dictators support us and they
control the population nothing else can
matter that's the Western conception of
democracy very clearly
exhibit uh the Maser Doctrine is
rational and very venerable to mention
just one case that's highly relevant
today and ought to be taught to everyone
in schools in the west uh there was was
internal discussion in 1958 President
Eisenhower and Eisenhower expressed
concern about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not by governments but by
the people and the National Security
Council issued a memorandum explaining
it they they said that there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports dictatorships and
blocks democracy and development
and we do it in order to ensure control
over their resources and furthermore
they said the perception is basically
accurate uh and that's exactly what we
should be doing relying on the mher
doctrine long as the dictators can keep
the population are control doesn't
matter what they think if there's a
campaign of hatred who cares uh after
9/11 uh there
were you may recall that George Bush
president natively pleaded that they
hate our freedom echoed by many
intellectuals the government actually
carried out a study and it confirmed
that they do not hate our freedom they
hate our policies and with good reason
namely the ones that the National
Security Council described in
1958 uh the truth of the matter is we
hate their freedom and with very good
reason uh we being the governments of
the West and Elite opinion in the West
well in Egypt uh though the old regime
Still Remains pretty much in place there
have been important victories the Press
is far more free labor organizing which
was brutally crushed under the Western
back dictatorships it now proceeds
effectively and the struggle for
democracy is unabated it's going on
constantly uh now poses serious threats
to the United States and it's Israeli
client for the first time in 30 Years
Egypt has allowed Iranian ships to
Transit the Suez Canal into the
Mediterranean which is supposed to be an
American Lake actually just yesterday
you may have read uh was reported that
Iranian submarines were allowed to
Transit uh into the
Mediterranean uh Egypt is also planning
to exchange ambassadors with Iran for
the first time uheg Egypt has partially
opened the Gaza
border that precedes it breaks the US
Israeli Siege which is designed to keep
the people of Gaza at the barest level
of survival Egypt has also brokered an
agreement between Hamas and fat two
major Palestinian factions that
interferes with us Israeli policies that
go back 20 years to separate Gaza and
the West Bank it's an explicit violation
of the Oslo Accords but the purpose is
to undermine the prospects for a viable
Palestinian State well there's something
more threatening in the
background uh the Egyptian public is
strongly opposed to the way the
1979 Egypt Israel treaty has been
interpreted by the us back
dictators uh
articulating the Western interpretation
of the treaty the New York Times
describes it as a Cornerstone of the
Region's
stability that's true only if we
understand the term stability in a the
technical sense of foreign policy
discourse it means Conformity to us
demands that's a standard usage in
reality it's a Cornerstone of the
Region's
instability it was under stood at once
uh by uh uh that the effect of the
Egyptian defection as it was called
would be to free Israel to sustain
military operations against the
Palestinian or organizations in Lebanon
as well as settlement activity in the
West Bank I'm quoting one of Israel's
leading strategic analysts of n Yaniv
and it's obvious you remove the Egyptian
deterrent the only major deterrent in
the Arab world can proceed to do what
you like uh and in fact Israel at once
prepared to invade Lebanon as it did in
1982 with strong support from the Reagan
Administration killed maybe 20,000
people destroyed much of the country it
sought to establish a puppet regime uh
didn't quite succeed uh and the purpose
was to consolidate control over the West
spank and that was frankly admitted
there was no security concern uh also
settlement in the occupied territories
all illegal proceeded very rapidly uh
and the problem is that further progress
in toward democracy in Egypt might
seriously threaten the form of so-called
stability that the US seeks to
impose well as I mentioned Arab public
opinion strongly supports an Iranian
nuclear weapons program but that doesn't
mean that we should do so could be
extremely dangerous and if you read the
foreign policy literature even the Press
it's full of proposals as to how to deal
with this Potential Threat uh one
proposal is studiously ignored the one
that's very strongly favored by most of
the world namely establish a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East now
that issue regularly arises
at the uh regular meetings the
conferences of the nonproliferation
treaty conference every five years last
one was at the UN headquarters in New
York last year uh at that point Egypt
was the chair of the 118 nations of the
non-aligned movement it's most of the
world uh they proposed that the
conference call for negotiations on a
Middle East nuclear weapons free zone
that had been formally agreed by the
West including the United States at the
1995 review conference but didn't do
anything about it well International
support last year was so overwhelming
that the Obama Administration formally
had to agree uh while saying fine idea
but not now uh furthermore they insisted
that Israel be Exempted and of course
the US is self-exempting Ed from
International obligations in quite
interesting ways which are not well
understood uh Washington informed the
conference uh that no
proposal quoting it now no proposal can
call for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the offices of the
international atomic energy agency and
no proposal can call for release of
information about is Israeli nuclear
facilities and activities including
information pertaining to previous
nuclear transfers to Israel well so much
for a nuclear weapons free zone uh
that's one of the many ways in which the
threat of nuclear war is being Advanced
right now it's worth bearing in mind how
isolated the United States and its
allies are on Iran
the non-aligned countries again most of
the world for years they've been
vigorously endorsing Iran's right to
pursue the uranium enrichment the Arab
world as I mentioned even wants them to
go onto nuclear weapons the most
important country in the region turkey
is improving commercial relations with
Iran a very natural trading partner and
it's announ announced plans to Triple
its relations the most respected country
of the global south Brazil has also
strongly supported Iran's position
that's most of the world well the United
States can tolerate Turkish and
Brazilian Disobedience though with
dismay but China is harder to ignore the
Press warns I'm quoting the New York
Times that China's investors and Traders
are now filling a vacuum in Iran
as businesses from other countries
especially in Europe pull out the Europe
is obedient to us orders but China isn't
these sanctions have absolutely no
status those are unilateral us sanctions
China does observe the UN sanctions but
that's because they're Toothless the
issue has to do with the unilateral us
sanctions uh in particular China's
expanding its dominant role in Iran's
energy industry well Washington is very
upset and they're reacting with a touch
of
desperation the state department issued
a warning to China that if it wants to
be accepted in the International
Community that's another technical term
like stability the International
Community means the United States and
anybody who happens to be going along
with it at the moment uh so if they want
to be accepted in the International
Community uh then China must not skirt
and evade International
responsibilities which are clear namely
follow us orders uh as I said China does
accept the relatively toothless un
sanctions but it ignores the unilateral
us sanctions it's therefore undermining
stability in the technical sense it's an
illegitimate exercise of sovereignty in
violation of grand area principles that
need not say that China's quite
unimpressed by the stern mning their
picture is we've been around for 3,000
years disregarding The Barbarians and
will
continue and and that's very disturbing
to the United States well the hegemonic
doctrines that were formulated during
World War II they still Prevail but the
cap capacity to implement them is
declining as the world is becoming more
diverse more independent but there are
also as I mentioned there are domestic
factors contributing to America's
decline the society is being quite
consciously undermined at home by the
people who Adam Smith called the masters
of mankind those who control the
economic system no time to go into the
details but since the uh sharp economic
shift
towards financialization and offshoring
of production in the
1970s a variety of factors have
converged to create a vicious cycle of
radical concentration of
wealth mostly in the top
1% one tenth of 1% actually uh of the
population such a small group it's not
even picked up by census figures that's
where the heavy inequal extreme
inequalities coming from now that means
uh CEOs you know directors of
Corporations hedge fund managers and so
on uh their activities are of little if
any benefit to the economy they probably
harmful to it uh uh but that's where the
economic power is concentrated and
concentration of economic power
translates at once to concentration of
political power it's another Point
emphasized by that dangerous radical
Adam Smith who we're suppos to worship
but not read too dangerous to reading uh
he pointed out that in his day speaking
of England the merchants and
manufacturers were the masters of man
kind and they were also the principal
architects of policy they made sure that
their own interests were very well
served no matter how Grievous the effect
on others including the people of
England well that was the 1770s and that
principle
remains uh the concentration of uh
economic and with it political power has
led to State policies that are designed
to increase the
concentration uh fiscal policies rules
of corporate governance
deregulation uh a lot more uh meanwhile
the costs of electoral campaigns have
skyrocketed that has a very clear effect
it drives both political parties deeper
into the pockets of concentrated Capital
increasingly Financial capital and for
the Republicans this is
reflexive the Democrats are not far
behind what are there's a lot of
commentary about The Disappearance of
moderate moderate Republicans that's not
quite accurate they're still there
they're not called Democrats uh
everything has shifted so far to the
right that uh old-fashioned moderate
Republicans are now the leading
Democrats in fact if Richard Nixon were
in Congress now he'd be caucusing with
half a dozen people on the far left
that's not a joke
incidentally uh well while wealth and
power have narrowly
concentrated for most people in the
country the real incomes have stagnated
and they've been getting by with
increased work hours by now far higher
than Europe even Japan uh debt which can
only go on for so long and asset
inflation
like the EXP the bubble the housing
bubble is the most recent case and these
uh bubbles are repeatedly destroyed by
the financial crisis crises that began
to occur uh in the Reagan years uh as
the regulatory apparatus was dismantled
the effect is that the country is being
severely weakened well none of this is
problematic for the very wealthy in
particular for the financial
institutions by their share of corporate
profit arose to an astonishing
40% in 2007 right before the crash that
they caused and the major players
benefit from a government insurance
policy which is called too big to fail
and as one commentator equipped too big
to jail and they can get away with any
crimes they like they can
uh the result is that with the
government insurance policy they can
make and do make very risky
transactions which mean Rich
rewards uh uh while adhering to a a
basic Market principle
that you ignore externalities in a
market system make a transaction you
ignore the effect on others what
economists call externalities in this
case the externality is systemic risk
the risk that if one of your
transactions goes back bad the whole
system May collapse well the system
inevitably crashes it's happened over
and over again since the Reagan year is
each time more serious than the last but
that's not a problem because they can
can run to the 90 state that they
nurture and ask for a taxpayer bailout
and meanwhile they clutch their copies
of Hayek and Milton Friedman and Ein
Rand in their hands uh and that's been
the regular process since the Reagan
years uh uh it's each crisis more
extreme than the last for the public
that is right now the real unemployment
is the levels of the Great Depression
for much of the population but the main
architects of the crisis are bigger and
richer than before uh that's what
happens when you control the state
Goldman Sachs for
example the biggest criminal they've
just quietly announced
$17.5 billion dollar in compensation for
last year for executives with the CEO
Lloyd blank fine receiving a .5 million
bonus and his base salary was tripled uh
in appreciation for having crashed the
economy and much the same is true among
um among its
colleagues England is pretty much the
same well these developments contribute
to American
decline but not as often argued to the
shift of global global uh Power to China
and India the world's becoming more
diverse but despite their rapid economic
progress these two great Asian powers
are hardly poised to assume a dominant
role in the world uh one illustration
you can look it up in the internet uh is
the United the United Nations human
development index kind of measures the
health of the
society uh China now ranks
89th right next to the Dominican
Republic and El Salvador two pretty poor
countries uh India ranks
115th it's next to cap Verde and Timor
leste extremely poor countries uh each
of these two Asian Giants also suffers
from extreme
inequality about the same as the US uh
that means that the large majority of
the population ranks even lower the CIA
estimates that China's uh gross domestic
product per capita at about 20% of that
of the rich countries Europe for example
furthermore they both have huge internal
problems ecological and human India is
torn apart by Major internal Wars China
by severe repression and very wide labor
unrest tens of thousands of Labor
actions every year according to official
figures reality is probably greater uh
China's also facing a severe demographic
problem it did have spectacular recent
growth but that relied very heavily on
the availability of a young and
productive labor force that's a nonre
repeatable historical phenomenon China
scholar Wong Fang observes that
favorable Democratic demographic
dividend is expected very soon to
disappear and in fact to reverse sharply
with significant effects on labor
productivity and also on social life uh
in particular ability to care for the
growing elderly
population social system that formerly
existed is collapsed also there's an
effect on the of the sex selection there
a illegal but there's a very definite
sex selection policy it has led to a
vast excess of males over females uh in
the population under 20 and that could
have extremely severe social
effects China is indeed a huge
manufacturing center but it's not like
Germany uh China is basically an
assembly plant it's an assembly plant
for the advanced industrial societies
surrounding it Japan South Korea Taiwan
they provide the parts and the
components and the advanced technology
as incidentally does the United States
and other rich countries of the West uh
everyone talks about the US trade
deficit with China but when it's
properly calculated as has been done by
a couple of
economists uh namely estimated in terms
of value added how much is produced
literally produced in each country well
it turns out that the deficit with China
declines by about
25% and the deficit with its Asian
suppliers increases by about
25% uh so this is not the kind of export
economy that Germany is quite different
sooner or later China will presumably
climb the technology ladder but it's not
going to be an easy path there is in
fact a very noticeable and significant
Global shift of power but a different
one
not from the West to the agent Giants
but from the global Workforce all around
the world to the very rich that's
happening everywhere the tendency is
implicit in what are called free trade
agreements which have little to do with
free trade and certainly aren't
agreements at least if people are part
of their countries they're mostly
opposed uh but what are called free
trade agreements uh with um
they're designed to set working people
in competition with one another globally
while protecting wealthy professionals
and providing investors with
extraordinary rights among other
benefits for investors these agreements
allow free movement of capital but they
firmly reject Adam Smith's principle
that free circulation of Labor is a
foundation of free trade and many other
ways too they violate basic free trade
principles and these Tendencies are
exacerbated in very ugly Ways by growing
xenophobia in the rich
societies notably in Europe the picture
that's developing is very aptly
described in a brochure for investors
that was produced recently by City Group
it's a huge bank that once again is is
feeding at the public trough as it has
done regularly for 30 years in the
course of a cycle of risky loans huge
profits and bailout when it crashes uh
the and like Goldman sacks they've
gained from the crisis that they helped
create the bank's analysts in this
brochure they describe a world that's
dividing into two blocks the one block
they call the plutonomy
uh that's the very rich globally and
they're the ones who power the growth
and they're the ones who largely consume
the growth then there are the non-rich
the majority those are now sometimes
called the global
precariat precariat is a Workforce
proletariat living in a precarious
existence that's increasing status of
the global Workforce uh in the United
States the precariat is uh subject to uh
Global working insec worker
insecurity that's Alan Greenspan's words
when he was testifying to Congress about
the success of the economy he was
managing he said it's based on growing
worker insecurity which is the basis for
a healthy economy any Economist can
explain if workers are insecure
don't ask for rights they don't ask for
wages they don't make any protests you
can harshly exploit them uh the city
group analysts advise investors to focus
on the very rich where the action is
they have what they call a plutonomy
stock basket you know investment advice
aimed at the very Ridge and they point
out that that plutonomy stock basket has
greatly
outperformed the world index of
developed markets since
1985 that's when Reagan Thatcher
economic programs of enriching the very
wealthy were really taking off well that
that's a shift of power and a very
significant one I've barely skimmed the
surface of these critical issues enough
I hope to suggest things you can think
about but I don't want to end without
mentioning another externality that's
dismissed in Market systems that's the
fate of the
species uh if you're a corporate
executive your task is to maximize
short-term profit and u u market share
that's in fact what your salary is based
on if that happens to endanger the
species that's an externality you don't
pay pay for it you don't take account of
it in a market system uh in the
financial system systemic
risk main externality that can be
remedied by the taxpayer but nobody's
going to come to the rescue if the
environment is destroyed and that it
must be destroyed comes pretty close to
being an Institutional imperative so us
Business Leaders us is the most business
run Society in the world
so significant in this respect us
Business Leaders are quite openly
conducting energetic propaganda
campaigns to convince the population
that uh anthropogenic global warming
human contribution to global warming is
just a
hoax uh and they're having some success
by now probably 2third of the population
doesn't believe it uh well these same
people who are running the campaigns
they're just like the rest of us they
understand very well that the threat is
grave I mean in their private lives
maybe they're contributing to you know
Sierra Club or something but in their
institutional lives they have a role uh
they have to maximize short-term profit
and market share uh if they don't do it
they'll be thrown out and somebody else
will come in who will do it meaning the
problem is institutional it's not
individual hence it's much more severe
now this this is another vicious cycle
and this one could well turn out to be
lethal if you want to get a sense of how
grave the danger is simply have a look
at the new Congress in the United States
which is propelled into Power by
business funding and
propaganda almost all of the new people
in Congress are climate deniers climate
change deniers don't believe it and
they've already begun to cut measures
that might mitigate Environmental
catastrophe uh so for example they're
trying to get rid of the Environmental
Protection Agency introduced by Nixon
the last liberal president and now they
want to get rid of it and much else uh
we're still some of them are really true
believers for example the new head of a
subcommittee on the environment he
explained to the press that global
warming cannot be a problem because God
promised Noah that there wouldn't be
another flood
so takes care of that
well
actually one shouldn't laugh I mean if
this was happening in some small remote
country okay then you could laugh but
not when it's happening in the richest
and most powerful country in world
history and before we laugh uh we might
also bear in mind that the current
financial and economic crisis is
traceable in no small measure to a
fanatic faith in certain
dogmas uh such as What's called the
efficient market hypothesis and in
general to What U Nobel Lau Joseph
stiglets 15 years ago called the
religion and it is a religion that
markets know
best the religion made it unnecessary
for economists and in fact the Federal
Reserve the Central Bank made it un
necessary for them to notice that there
was an $8 trillion housing bubble it's a
lot of money $8 trillion housing bubble
no economic fundamentals no relation to
anything that in the economy but they
didn't have to notice it because uh the
market knows best efficient markets
devastated the economy when it burst
that's a serious religion and interest
incidentally that religion has been
reconstituted almost without change
after the total collapse of
this uh edifice this intellectual
edifice it's a remarkable event in
economic history in fact in intellectual
history it's useful to think about
what's being done in the richest country
the richest most powerful country in
human history and what's going on in the
poorest country of South America uh in
the United States Congress is taking the
lead uh in and the Obama Administration
is going along in undermining any hope
for preventing catastrophe and as I
mentioned it's driven by deeply rooted
institutional factors uh poorest country
in South America is Bolivia they are
have taken the lead in the world in
efforts to protect the environment their
most recent effort is to pass
legislation granting rights to the
Natural natural world well sophisticated
westerners uh ridicule such naive T but
unless we gain some of the sensibility
of the indigenous majority in Bolivia
the last laugh is going to be on us well
all of this and a great deal more can
proceed as long as the muasher doctrine
prevails as long as the general
population is
passive apathetic diverted to
consumerism hatred of the vulnerable as
long as that goes on the powerful can do
what they please masters of the
universal have their will and those who
manage to survive can contemplate the
ruins
[Applause]
thanks um I would like to quote you um
in an article on capitalism Europe and
the World Bank about a court case that
um that urged corporations to carry out
benevolent activities or else an aroused
public May figure out what corporations
are up to and take away their
privileges now given that um how you on
different occasions quoted John dwey
government is the shadow cast by
business over Society thus court cases
like Dodge versus for affect the
behavior of politicians does what uh
court cases like Dodge versus for um the
behavior of politicians and if yes uh
which methods are at the disposal of
small and Reginal operating initiatives
to make politicians aware of the
existence of an aroused public SE well a
business can't ignore the it's I quote
John dwey but I also quote Adam Smith
who said the same thing uh the U and
many others uh business can't ignore
what the population is doing actually
that's true of totalitarian States as
well so for example the Nazi leadership
could not ignore public opinion if you
look back they provided benefits to the
public to try to keep them quiet uh and
the same is true in every totalitarian
state and certainly in more free and
Democratic societies that's true and you
can see it happening so let's go back to
the Great
Depression uh the there was President
Roosevelt who was unlike the current
leadership he was fairly sympathetic to
Social Democratic measures but at one
point he told labor leaders who were
pressing for him to do various things he
basically told them you make me do it
what he meant is get out in the streets
protest in the factories carry out sit
down strikes organize and if there's
enough public pressure I'll do it uh but
I've got to face down corporate power
well that's basically the right advice
and that's exactly what happened uh the
depr Great Depression is an interesting
case it it began in
1929 but the measure the New Deal
measures actually began about 6 years
later took a while and by that time
there was massive
public protest that was the period of
great Labor organizing the CIO the great
industrial Union was being organized and
they were moving on to sitdown strikes
the sitdown strikes are extremely
frightening to the masters of mankind
because a sitdown strike is just one
step before saying we don't need the
bosses we'll run the place ourselves
okay at that point you get a major
concerns actually those are the concerns
that uh in the early post-war period
animated us and British planners in
places like Germany they were concerned
that that was going to happen under
pressure this pressure from the East
that they were worried about it's one of
the reasons they wanted to wall off
Western Germany and the same elsewhere
so these are constant concerns and it
runs from factories to protest in the
streets uh so for example and it has
effect during the 1960s the next great
in the United States the next major
period of U sort of Social Democratic
activism on the part of the government
that was clearly motivated by the uh
mostly youth at that time activism in
the N you know which you know about the
radical activism in the 60s and in fact
the business world was very upset about
it and the liberal intellectuals were
were very upset about it if you haven't
read it there's a important book to read
it's called the crisis of
democracy uh published by the trilateral
Commission in around mid-70s the
trilateral commission is liberal
internationalists from Europe the United
States and Japan three major industrial
countries that to give a sense of their
complexion they're they're the people
who staffed The Carter Administration
that's kind of the liberal extreme you
go over to the right it's much harsher
so what was the crisis of democracy that
they were concerned about they were
concerned that the population was
demanding too much democracy the people
who are usually passive and apathetic
what they call the special interests uh
are getting out in the streets and
protesting insisting on their demands so
who are the special interests the Young
the old women workers farmers in fact
the population the population of the
special interest if you notice there's
one you read the book you'll find
there's one interest that they don't
mention corporate power and there's a
reason for that because they're the
national interest by definition so they
can never ask for too much they're
supposed to get everything but the rest
of the population which is supposed to
be obey the muasher doctrine supposed to
be pass apathetic diverted to something
else they were getting out and demanding
things and there were changes and in
fact these changes ran primarily in the
Nixon in the Johnson Administration but
also in the Nixon Administration he as I
mentioned was the last liberal kind of
Social Democratic president well that's
from the pressures and that happens over
and over all the time that's just a
continuing aspect of modern history so
there's there's a lot you can do in fact
almost anything in a you know free
societies like like ours there very few
limits maybe it might be hard you know
you might lose a job or something but
you're not going to be tossed into a
torture chamber you know it's not like
the global south or totalitarian States
so sure this everything's open um
exactly what to do depends on the
circumstances in the issue a lot of it's
going on right now in say Spain
uh with very significant protests
underway it went on in the United States
uh in the industrial Heartland Wisconsin
right at the same time as the Arab
Spring also very significant if that
reaches enough of a scale uh the people
who run the place have to pay attention
in fact if you read the business
literature uh after the
1930s New Deal measures uh they were
terrified they business literature talks
about the hazard facing industrialists
in the rising political power of the
masses I'm quoting the need to fight the
Everlasting battle for the mind of men
to indoctrinate people with a capitalist
story or else we'll be in trouble you
know if this sounds like a little red
book uh it's it's because it is uh the
business classes are vulgar marxists and
with they're always fighting a bitter
class war and uh values Happ to be
inverted but it's just what you read in
you know malice tracks or something like
that so they understand constantly at it
and if the population gets out of
control have you have to do things uh
plenty of examples in fact modern
history is full of them that's why we
have more freedom and more rights and so
on it's not given as gifts from above
[Music]
As I understood you it's upon us as
Citizens to change the system uh do you
think the Democracy as we have it at the
moment is enough for that or do we need
forms of direct democracy or new forms
of
democracy
I mean in principle we've got
institutions that could work but you
have to make them work it's like roselt
said make me do
it and there are big barriers to
democracy so for example there's a
fundamental Contra contradiction between
capitalism and democracy you can't
overcome that contradiction uh so
it's uh you know capitalist system has
changed over the years but still divided
between people who give orders and
people who take them uh and as long as
that goes on well that's a plainly a
barrier to democracy uh if the masters
of mankind Adam Smith's phrase if they
get too much power then the barrier is
very high uh if they can be controlled
then barrier goes down incidentally to
quote John dwey again that John Dewey
was not a particular r IAL he was the
leading social philosopher in the United
States in the late 20th century 20th
century throughout his position was not
only that what you quoted that U
um democracy is the shadow cast by
business over Society he also went on he
said this he went on to say that this
isn't going to change until you have
democracy everywhere meaning industrial
democracy in the the workplace worker
control of production and popular
control of every other institution as
long as you don't have
that policy will remain the shadow C
Cast by concentrated power over Society
so yeah there should be if you really
want functioning democracy it's got to
go to institutional changes significant
[Music]
ones hello my name isio from radio
station fos aopa Dear Mr chsky I have
two questions you were speaking about
the Arab Spring uh how do you analyze
the uprisings now masses of people in
Spain and especially now in Greece going
the streets rejecting the party system
and uh demanding direct democracy and
you were referring to the nuclear
Ambitions of Iran how can you do that
without mentioning the slaughtering of
people in Iran from the regime there uh
people who are was struggling for
Freedom the last years in Iran for
democracy in Iran in Iran yes yeah well
um first of all Spain and Greece um
quite important things are H quite
important things are happening in Iran
and Greece but they're different uh you
got to look at these things in their
particular
circumstances so uh in Greece there's
massive public protest against the
austerity programs that are being
imposed by the central
authorities and those are very
destructive programs now I think for all
of Europe my own feeling I think us what
you need at a time of recession is not
austerity you need stimulus in this case
I tend to agree with the Obama
Administration though they do much too
little of it but in Greece it's harming
them very badly I they have real
problems but the programs that are being
rammed down their throat by the European
authorities
are very likely going to destroy the
economy so people are protesting but if
you look closely they don't seem to be
protesting for
anything not much at least there aren't
it's hard to find any positive calls
coming out they're opposing what's
happening and they should be but what do
you do well you know there are a few
options not very many but talk about
them in Spain uh there's major protests
and there are programs but if you look
at the programs they are sensible but
mildly reformist so mildly reform
they're needed uh but the even the Press
points out Spanish press well these are
feasible mostly they're calling for
political reform like change in the you
know electoral system to allow more
participation and so on those are things
it could be instituted uh without you
know the Masters objecting much so it's
very important and may go on may go on
beyond that but right now it's a
significant call for limited but
essential reform that's Iran and Greece
roughly uh in the United States
Wisconsin which was a big Uprising tens
of thousands of people in the streets
day after day occupying the state
capital and so on they went well beyond
and not just young people all they were
calling for something else namely
defense of rights that are being
destroyed uh there's an effort by the
rightwing to eliminate the last limited
residue of Labor rights collective
bargaining and there's big popular
Uprising to protest that
uh you mentioned Iran there's very ugly
regime highly repressive but
unfortunately it's not unusual in the
region like Saudi Arabia is
worse um nobody talks about Saudi Arabia
because it's a u it's a western client
so they can do whatever they like uh
there was an effort in Saudi Arabia to
join the Arab Spring you have a day of
Rage protests on Friday the security
presence was so extreme that people were
afraid to go out in the streets nothing
happened and there's no protest in the
west the same in quit loyal dictators
are given the right to do anything they
want uh disloyal ones you got to do
something about U Iran nothing much that
the West can do so you know just they
scream about it but can't do anything so
sure we ought to talk about it we ought
to try to help the protesters and try to
protect them but uh the means are quite
Limited in contrast the means are very
great where the West has influence
substantial influence as with the
U Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain Egypt
elsewhere so yes you're right but what
would you suggest
doing hello um what do you uh please K
you explain the meaning of nation
building of
nation building nation building
yes it's just another fraud you know
it's like I mean
uh I mean there are there are real cases
so the cases that are always presented
in the literature are the success in
nation building in Western Europe and
Japan after the second World War
but take a close look at what was done
first of all the these were societies
that had already been
functioning like if you go back to the
1920s let's say Germany was considered
the you know most Democratic Society in
the west also the peak of Western
civilization in many ways you know
Sciences arts and so on major industrial
power was all in people's heads so to
rec there was no real Nation building in
Germany it was just allowing the local
forces to act within limits and you
should it's important to understand the
limits there's good scholarship on this
I was quoting some of it uh the effort
the primary effort in Germany and the
rest of Europe was to restore the
traditional order and to crush the
anti-fascist resistance which was
largely labor-based so they got to be
crushed traditional order has to be rein
restored uh that started right away as
the British and American forces
were beginning to enter Europe that
started in Italy remember Sicily then up
through the Italian Peninsula
1943 one of their first tasks was to
restore the fascist order uh and a
traditional business rule and to destroy
the resistance and the resistance was
pretty significant uh the Italian
partisans they were holding down six
Nazi divisions and they had pretty much
liberated the northern part of the
country before the British and uh
Americans got there the British and
Americans had to destroy the democratic
system that had been developed by the
left movements left labor movements and
to restore the uh traditional order then
well I won't go through the details but
subversion in Italy goes right on until
at least the 1970s it's when the record
runs dry to try to prevent those forces
from emerging in Greece it was the same
uh Britain tried to suppress the uh ad
Adin naazi resistance they weren't
powerful enough to do it they called in
the United States uh in
4748 there was a major Civil War in
which maybe 150,000 people or so got
killed torture Terror so on ENT
restoring the
traditional quasi fascist order driving
out the partisan movement the left and
so on and it happened everywhere same in
Japan same in Korea that was a postwar
policy so yes there was a kind of nation
building but nation building in accord
with grand area principles uh not the
pleasant mythology that people are
taught in school uh so yeah it can
happen but uh um the other places where
there have been economic and social
successes it's been over the objections
of the West there's pretty good
scholarship on this
incidentally uh so it's the nation
building is kind of like democracy
promotion it's another
term used the same way and there's very
good scholarship on it it doesn't
penetrate the intellectual Community it
doesn't reach the media and so on but
it's there if you want to look into it U
speaking of the United States a very
good source is the work of a man named
Thomas
kurs he's a True Believer
he's he was an official in the Reagan
Administration Insider working on na on
nation building you know democracy
promotion in mostly Latin America but
he's written about it all over the world
he was the head of the uh law and
democracy project of the Arie endowment
you know big prestigious institution
written several books right up to the
mid couple of year years ago and he
points out that uh he's a good scholar
an honest scholar he believes in it but
he says that uh you he's speaking about
the United States same with everyone
else uh he said us leaders are
schizophrenic they support democracy if
and only if it Accords with social and
economic
objectives and he takes say the Reagan
Administration which was full of talk of
democracy promotion and he was in it he
was working within it he said they were
sincere but they uh if you look at the
progress of democracy he said and in the
Western Hemisphere it did occur but it
occurred in the regions where the United
States had least influence so if you go
down to the southern cone Southern
countries of the Western Hemisphere
there was progress in democracy and as
he pointed out Reagan tried to prevent
it and support the dictatorships he
couldn't manage so there was some
democracy promotion but if you come to
the Regions near the United States where
US influence was overwhelming this is
essentially no moves towards democracy
and he gives the reason that the United
States was willing to tolerate only
top-down forms of democracy in which
traditional uh ruling groups remain in
control and remain subservient to the
United States those are approximately
his words well he considers this kind of
like a pathology so the leadership ought
to be sent to for psychoanalysis because
they're schizophrenic there's a much
simpler explanation plainly but that
one's ideologically unacceptable and the
same is true of nation building so for
democracy is fine for the West in
Eastern Europe great so you hail what's
called democracy in fact it's
interesting to look at why they Hil it
they go back to the business press in
1990 they're very enthusiastic about the
r the separation of the Eastern European
satellites from Soviet control the
reasons were uh it would enable Business
Leaders to undermine the quoting the
luxurious lifestyle of Western workers
because there's a new labor force that's
healthy
educated blonde and blue-eyed they
didn't say that but that's implicit uh
that can be exploited very brutally
exploited and that'll undercut the
Western labor movements so it's terrific
democracy in Eastern Europe is fantastic
but not democracy in other countries
that we want to control like not in the
Middle East for example because it would
be a disaster as I said just look at
public opinion um so that's nation
building and democracy promotion very
hard to find an
exception um maybe
there's space for one last short
question because we have an invitation
then to dinner with the recor and I
think we have
to uh and I think it's worthwhile yeah
and um um yeah who is who is who is here
close to a to to a microphone
um no
no Kristoff just give a microphone to
someone you're
not
yeah
so German press we have in the German
press we have periodic reminders that
the European monetary Union is on the
brink of collapse on the one hand
because like our payments to Greece and
Portugal and Ireland of course always
with xenophobic undertones um and on the
other hand that the um dollar is also
very volatile I'm not sure I'm really
skeptic about what this these uh
announcements have for a function but do
you believe that these currencies are
really on the um brink of collapse and
if that would happen what effect would
that have on the global
order I don't think that the the Euro
and the dollar and the end or not on the
brick of collapse I these are very rich
societies with all the problems they're
having historically speaking it's pretty
rich that's not there there're suffering
but not at the style of the South there
are
problems uh Europe is it is Rich enough
to bail out the countries that are in
trouble but it's not at all clear that
that's the right approach I mean why why
should Europe follow the recommendations
of the central bank that say the
solution to recession is
austerity that's been tried that's
Herbert Hoover in the United States you
know yeah his position was we got a big
depression let's go to austerity well
you know what happened economy totally
collapsed and there's pretty good reason
to suspect that that will happen again
if austerity is just not the right
response to
Unemployment uh um recession what's the
right response is essentially in a state
capitalist syst I me there more radical
responses but keeping to the
institutions the right responses
probably K's response which worked
stimulate there's a shortage of demand
demand stimulated and that's got to come
from the government it could lead to a a
a deficit and debt and so on but that
can be overcome with growth that's the
way to overcome it but furthermore the
main problem all over the Western World
Is Not uh de debt it's unemployment
unemployment is an extremely severe
problem for one thing it's very harmful
to the people you know so just on human
grounds the people the families the
communities they're suffering uh but
furthermore even on just narrow economic
grounds
unemployment means unused
resources these are this there working
people who want to work their things
that have to be done but the system is
so irrational it can't put uh un
eager uh needed work into the hands of
eager people well that's a real social
economic problem and it's not solved by
uh increasing U austerity program PRS if
you look at the particular countries
that you mentioned they're all different
so Ireland for example actually had a
surplus Spain too had a surplus uh in
Ireland the economic crisis came
primarily because the government bailed
out the banks I mean the banks destroyed
the economy uh they came up they come
came to the public and say okay bail us
out and yeah they did there's another
approach and that is say it's your
problem I mean suppose we anybody really
believed in capitalism nobody does but
if they did uh if uh investors let's say
Banks make risky loans a lot of profit
and then it crashes it's the problem of
the investors it's not the problem of
the community if anybody believed in
capitalism so that's another approach
they could have taken okay you made the
Investments you made the profits uh now
it's your problem uh you take the losses
uh but the masters of mankind don't take
the losses they expect the public to
bail them out it's pretty much was
happening in Spain Greece is a somewhat
different problem uh but I I don't
doesn't you know all of these things are
debatable it's not 2+ 2 equal 4 but I
think there's good reason to think that
the programs that are being pursued are
not well adapted to a situation of deep
unemployment unused resources you know
human costs and uh deficit which is a
problem that can be overcome with growth
if demand is increased the United States
is an interesting case actually United
States kind of leads led the way in this
but if you look closely at the United
States the deficit which is the big
problems the only issue discussed in
Washington is the deficit practically no
discussion of of the fact that
unemployment is at depression levels for
much of the population what's the
deficit well this has been well analyzed
in the United States about half the
deficit comes from military spending
military spending in the United States
is out of sight you know it's as about
as much as the rest of the world
combined it doesn't provide security in
fact it provides insecurity uh but it's
there for its own reasons
basically Grand area reasons in fact I
quoted Clinton as saying we have to keep
uh forces forward deployed in Europe and
Asia in order to ensure that people do
what we want okay not for the American
population so that's roughly half the
deficit the other half the deficit comes
from the completely dysfunctional Health
Care System the US Health Care system is
an international scandal
it's about twice the per capita cost of
other industrial countries and has some
of the worst
outcomes and the reason is not hard to
discover it's the
only
privatized unregulated system and the
private sector is extremely bad at
providing public goods like Health
highly inefficient a lot of
administrative
costs profits bureaucracy and all kinds
of things uh so sure it's extremely
expensive uh drugs in the United States
cost about twice as much as comparable
countries and the reason again is very
straightforward in the United States and
I think it's the only country in the
world least that I know of the
government is not permitted by law to
negotiate drug prices they can negotiate
anything else but not drug prices so big
surprise drug prices are out of sight
you know this is incidentally over the
objections of about 85% of the
population uh there are ways to deal
with this which are not utopian in fact
if the US had the same kind of Health
Care system as other industrial
countries you know not utopian there
would be no deficit in fact there would
actually be a surplus but you can't
touch that because that's getting to the
centers of power the financial
institutions big pharmaceutical
institutions they won't allow it to be
discussed since they basically run the
government uh you have a huge deficit
well you know you take a look at other
countries you can find ways of dealing
with the deficit problem differs from
country to country and the big problem
is lack of demand and lack of jobs and I
think that's even you know so the system
doesn't have to collapse I mean maybe it
will if the wrong policies are followed
but doesn't look
likely
thank you very
much
