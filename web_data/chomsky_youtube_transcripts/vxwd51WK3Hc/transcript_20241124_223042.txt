[Christmas Music]
[ Yanis] Hello, I'm Yanis Varoufakis, with
a very warm welcome to all of you
on this episode of DIEM TV's 
Another Now.
An end of year, end of 2021 wrap up
of a very strange, weird,
and pretty awful year.
Within which I trust, and I hope you 
managed to extract some joy and some hope.
In this very special episode,
made special,
because I have a very special guest
in Noam Chomsky, no less,
we're going to be talking about the
top issues, the top threats
as well as glimmers of hope that have
managed to shine through
this very dark cloud of the pandemic,
of the developments that have depleted
many of the opportunities
that our species has had.
Here's a preview of some of the things
that Noam and I discuss.
By the way - please forgive us
for a very rough edit,
different camera angles,
different sound qualities.
This interview took place in the middle
of the night for me
late in the afternoon in Phoenix Arizona
for Noam.
I hope you recognize that DiEM TV,
thankfully, is not a professional outfit.
We shall remain amateurs to the very
last moment of our existence.
So, as you will see very shortly,
I kick off the discussion with Noam
by asking him to pinpoint
the radical lessons from 2021.
Naturally, 
Noam talks about the pandemic.
The lessons we have learned from
the handling of the pandemic
by the powers that be, 
by those in authority
and links it skillfully
- with Noam's usual skill -
he links the lessons from the pandemic
and the influence of corporate capital
of financialized capital
of concentrated capital
on the mishandling of this pandemic.
He links it to the other 
existential threat that humanity is facing
and which made a turn for the far far
worse in COP26 in Glasgow.
The pivotal moment, supposedly, 
where the great and the good
from around the world would meet
in Glasgow in the fall
in order to give our species a chance,
a chance of ending its vandalism
of the planet,
a chance that we missed.
And it is
interesting how Noam connects
the way in which 
the capitalist world order,
or - I call post capitalist
but it doesn't matter -
mishandled the pandemic and the way
in which it wasted
a fantastic opportunity
this year in Glasgow.
At some point, I decided to play
devil's advocate and put it to him
that we progressives are
a bunch of losers
going from one perpetual defeat
to the other.
It is interesting how Noam Chomsky
responds and a great source of hope.
Turning to more specific geographic,
national in the economic bloc regions,
Noam doesn't mince his words
regarding the United States.
He explains meticulously
- with his usual analytical skills -
why and how the United States
is a political economy
that is going off the rails
with terrible repercussions for Americans
and non-americans alike.
Then he turns his laser-sharp focus
on the European Union,
is equally critical, 
particularly of the subservience
of European leaders
to the United States's hegemonic forces.
And then together we make a segway
to the oncoming threat of a new cold war
which is being built up by Washington DC,
by certain forces
within the security apparatus of the West,
in Europe, in Australia
and, of course, in North America.
But I also ask him the question:
how can we fight against the new cold war?
How can we stop as a movement, as the
Progressive International, for instance,
a process where the cold war may become
a hot war,
and, certainly,
how we progressives - led by
Progressive International, of course -
can put an end to this new cold war
without being apologists
for the atrocities committed
against peoples, against dissidents,
against certain segments of the population
within Russia, within China,
within those economic and political
blocs that the West's oligarchy
is trying to engage in hostilities
in a new cold war.
Then - and I have to tell you that this
is I think
my favorite part of the discussion
with Noam.-
I bring up the question of safe spaces
in universities in particular,
but more generally within movements,
a concept that has emerged recently
but powerfully within the scheme
of identity politics within our
movements, within our academy.
I think that part of the discussion has a
great deal of utility for progressives
and, of course, at the very end,
I asked Noam
to deliver a message regarding 2022.
Before we start,
let me use this opportunity
to plug the mέta dialogues.
The dialogues that our mέta center,
the Center for Post-Capitalist 
Civilization of DiEM25,
will be planning throughout 2022
between members of the
advisory board of DiEM25,
like Noam Chomsky, like Guy Standing
like Caroline Lucas.
These dialogues are going to bring two
members of our advisory board together,
in a discussion like the one that I'm
having today with Noam Chomsky
but far more targeted to the issues
of, you know:
'What is exactly that we're
fighting against?'
'What is the system that we are
fighting against?
'Is it capitalism? Is it something worse
than capitalism?'
And 'What system do we want
to put in its place?'
This is the plug for the mέta dialogues.
Watch this space and the DiEM25
and mέta websites.
They promise to be intriguing 
conversations throughout 2022.
Without further ado,
let's go to
my discussion with Noam Chomsky.
Covid19, to quote Monty Python:
'What has it done for us?'
"Has it contributed anything
to progressives, to humanity?"
"Has it taught us any lessons
that we can draw from?"
"Has it accelerated the decline of
the system of capitalism?"
- call it what you will - 
that progressives must challenge?"
"Is there a silver lining
to the Covid19 cloud?"
What have we learned in 2020,
Noam Chomsky?
[Noam] We learned more forcefully,
things we already knew.
Take Omicron, it's perfectly clear
why this happened
and why it will happen again.
The rich countries have monopolized
vaccines for themselves
and have insisted on preserving the
outlandish property rights agreements,
patent rights, assigned to the
basically monopoly pricing rights
assigned to the pharmaceutical
corporations
in the mislabeled free trade agreements,
which means that, for example,
Moderna, which was a small company,
was able 
to use extensive government funding,
government research, 
to develop a very effective vaccine.
Propelled several of the management up
into the super billionaire category.
But they will not permit South Africa,
which has a pharmaceutical industry
to produce their vaccines.
It means that South Africa could not
vaccinate the population sufficiently
to withhold the ongoing mutations.
It means that in the unvaccinated South
there's a potential for
a mutation
which can lead to serious consequences.
Of course, will
spread back to the West.
The wealthy and the powerful are - who
recognize all this, they understand it -
are willing to place the profits
of the major pharmaceutical corporations
and their prerogatives,
- given in the improper
trade agreements -
place that above the lives
of many millions of people
and even the welfare 
of their own populations?
It's an interesting value system.
It generalizes to something much more
important: global warming.
We just saw the outcome
of the COP26 fiasco.
There were two events taking place
inside the halls of the great buildings,
the men and women with their
suits and ties and jackets, and you know,
fancy dresses and so on.
So John Kerry
- the American negotiator - was euphoric
about the fact that we now have the market
on our side.
How can we lose?
The big investors have committed
themselves to working for our cause,
so with the 'holy' market working for us
we're racing ahead.
He was referring to the commitment by,
to comments by the head of Blackstone
Larry Fink, that the investment 
community is now ready
to commit 130 trillion dollars to solving
the crisis: we're in business!
Until you look at the footnotes, which was
actually done by Adam Tooz,
a fine political economist who pointed out
that there's a little condition attached:
The investment community is willing
to invest the money
IF they are guaranteed to be risk-free
by the IMF.
So we're perfectly happy to jump in
and help you as long as we
make money from it and there's
no risk involved.
Yes, the market's on our side.
That's the way the market works,
the market structured 
by the rich and the powerful
in their interests.
So we've learned that or
we should have learned that.
We should have also learned that 
while these meetings were going on
within the stately halls,
there was
also another event outside
tens of thousands of demonstrators,
mostly young, saying that:
we want a world, a decent survivable world
for ourselves and our children,
we want you inside those halls to use
the means that are available,
and you know are available
to overcome this crisis,
to lead the way to open the door
to a much better world.
And that leaves us with
the standard question:
Which of these forces is going to prevail?
Here's where the Progressive International
has its main function:
To ensure that the demonstrators
in the street will prevail.
And it's the same on Covid:
serious problem,
but not at the scale of global warming.
That means the end.
If we don't deal with it, 
it's finished.
But Covid, pandemics, 
this is probably not the last.
They will be deadly and destructive,
but not total destruction.
Those are the choices we have.
[Yanis] It seems to me from
what you're saying
that the real lesson we're learning
is that concentrated capital
concentrated corporate power, knows
how to take advantage of a crisis
of a humanitarian crisis,
whether it's Covid19
or it's a crisis of the climate breakdown,
they know how to marketize it.
They know how to make use of the state.
There is no conflict between 
the state and the market.
There will be no market without the state.
The state creates the circumstances
for capital accumulation
for profit maximization, so they know how
to take advantage of that
effectively undermining humanity's
collective interest
or the interest of the majority.
You're right. 
These are the two forces.
The forces within you know, the corridors
and the rooms of power in Glasgow
let's say, and the demonstrations
outside the walls.
But is it not really?
- let's not beat about the bush -
isn't the lesson of 2021 that so far
the forces within the corridors and
the rooms of power
are winning hands down?
You know, we've had demonstrations,
we had the World Social Forum,
we had Bologna, we had Seattle,
we had the Occupy Wall Street,
we had the Aganaktismeni hearing
in Greece,
we had Indignados in Spain...
But in the end our resistance follows
a sign wave,
goes up and down,
but it doesn't affect the capacity of
the inside light to ride the coattails
of a catastrophe,
making it worse
for humanity for the majority
while maximizing their own returns.
[Noam] I don't think it's
perpetual defeat.
There's slow steps forward, not enough,
but some.
So take the protests.
The International protests, 
the Global Climate Strike,
Extinction Rebellion.
All of these things have had an effect.
It has compelled the rich and
the powerful to recognize
that they have to do something to indicate
that they are on the side of the public.
Now, of course, they find their own
ways of doing it.
They'll do it rhetorically, 
they'll do it by greenwashing.
They'll do it by saying 
"Yes, net zero emissions!"
But of course we mean
"No, no elimination, 
only innovation!"
That's the phrase out of the Exxon Mobil
playbook repeated by Joe Manchin,
the Democratic senator
who's essentially
working with the fossil fuel companies
to ensure that nothing happens,
"No elimination, only innovation
and we're on your side!"
We want to go to net zero emissions,
but make as much profit
as we can along the way, okay,
which of course means 
that it's finished.
They'll find their ways to...
that's class war:
You find your ways to achieve your aims by
whatever method you can,
but that doesn't mean you always win.
In fact, there are steps forward.
They're halting steps.
Not enough, 
but there are some.
Take the United States,
the Biden administration,
put forth a climate program
which is inadequate,
but well beyond
anything that preceded it.
Right now in Congress,
it's being cut back
to virtually nothing
by 100 percent Republican opposition and
right-wing Democrats like Joe Manchin,
who happens to be a coal baron himself
and the leading recipient in Congress
of fossil fuel funding.
So, he's blocking it.
But at least something is there.
There is
a resolution in Congress
initiated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
and Ed Markey
senior senator from Massachusetts,
which does spell out in some detail
the well-known feasible means to deal with
and overcome the crisis.
It's reached the level of a resolution.
Well, that tells you what you
have to do next:
increase the pressure until it
becomes a legislative option.
It's a step, 
not enough of a step.
If it hadn't been for the demonstrations,
the pressures and so on,
we would just be essentially in
the Trump era:
"Race as fast as possible, 
quickly as possible toward the precipice."
Well, neither is good, but one
is worse than the other.
So in some ways
the activism
has fended off the worst,
but left plenty of room 
for the class war to continue
One of the lessons we should learn
from 2021
is what is happening to the most powerful,
wealthy state in world history.
It's going off...
literally going off the precipice.
There was recently a study of attitudes
of Republican voters
on many issues, 
a comparative study,
comparing them with European parties.
The results are pretty grim: 
they rank with parties like
Alternative for Deutschland
the right-wing neo-fascist parties.
It is one of the two major
parties in the United States,
the party that is very likely 
to take power next year and in 2024
because of various manipulations and
shenanigans that they're carrying out.
They won't win the vote,
but they may very well 
probably win the election.
Now if the AfD was taking power
in Germany, we'd be concerned.
It's much more dangerous when it's
taking power in the world dominant power,
history's most powerful state.
That's a lesson to learn.
It's not a small point.
If you take a look at the attitudes
of Republican voters
during the four Trump years:
Concern for global warming
declined by about 20 percent.
That's four years 
of propaganda.
There are ominous signs of worship
of a semi-deity
- we're both old enough 
to remember that -
from somewhere else.
These are not pleasant developments
and it's going to be very tricky
to overcome them.
Massive popular protest is necessary
and it has to be backed in Europe.
Another lesson of 2021 is that Europe
is unwilling or incapable
of taking its the role in the world
that it could play.
Take Germany, which was in the lead
in protecting the rights of Big Pharma,
to keep the process patents
for themselves.
Germany may be the most civilized country
in the world right now,
was in the lead.
That shouldn't be happening.
Right now, the Iran negotiations
are collapsing, largely because Germany
and the rest of Europe, 
refuses to play an independent role
in world affairs.
When the United States pulled out
of the agreement
- in violation of international law,
if anyone cares -
it's in violation of security council
resolution,
Europe strongly protested, said: 
We don't like this. We oppose it.
We oppose the extra sanctions you're
imposing, but will obey because we obey.
As long as Europe follows that policy
of subordination to external power, 
to US power,
the outlook looks quite grim.
That brings us to another crucial issue:
what's called the China threat.
What exactly is the China threat?
Actually, the former prime minister
of Australia, Paul Keating,
a distinguished international diplomat,
had a pretty good definition of it.
He wrote an article in the Australian
press running through the various claims
about the China threat, showing,
debunking them
and said the China threat is real.
It's China's existence.
The existence of a power that will not
be intimidated by the United States
the way Europe is and will not be
pushed around the way Europe is
but insists on pursuing its own interests.
Plenty to criticize about China,
but that's not the reason
for the China threat.
The reason is: it's there.
It's refusing to be intimidated,
it's continuing to expand its,
what are called, soft power policies,
expanding its influence through Central
Asia, obviously with the intention
of reaching Eastern Europe,
Central Europe, Africa,
will bring in Afghanistan now
and it's establishing vocational schools
throughout the world
throughout Southeast Asia 
and Africa,
where students 
will study Chinese technology.
What the United States is trying hard
to prevent the world from accepting.
Fine, they can't stop the US,
but they'll do their method.
They'll bring in large parts of the world
to be trained in, 
later using Chinese technology
as they spread their influence.
Well, for the United States,
that's intolerable!
You cannot have a force, a counterforce,
that can't be intimidated
and that's a major threat to survival.
It's leading to provocative actions
which might explode
and could lead to a terminal war.
This is another threat.
Similar things are happening
in the Ukraine, other lessons.
There are ways to deal with these things.
Diplomatic options are open.
Negotiation is possible.
Negotiation's are not going to lead to the
world the way the US leadership wants,
but it can lead to a viable world,
a world in which we can move forward.
Progress beyond.
We could even imagine in Europe going
back to something like Gorbachov's vision.
In 1991
- time of the collapse of the Soviet Union -
there were two options on the table:
Gorbachov's vision of a unified Eurasia,
Brussels to Vladivostok.
No military organizations,
just a peaceful Eurasia.
US vision was different: expansion
of a hostile military alliance,
NATO under US control
as far to the east as possible.
Well, but there were moves to invite
even Ukraine, into NATO,
something that no Russian government
would ever tolerate.
And it's leading, it's one of the factors.
There are many leading to what could be
a highly dangerous crisis.
Well, these things can be overcome.
Here again, an independent force like
Progressive International
can play a major role in mobilizing public
opinion and taking particular actions
in case after case.
There have been some successes.
It's a long haul.
It's the only way.
Only way in which you can avert
catastrophe which is looming
on many fronts.
[Yanis] Let me share a concern
that I have.
I have been,
- along the lines of what you've been saying -
I've been struggling in various fora
to maintain a balance between
warning progressives against falling prey
to the new cold warriors
of washington DC, from Brussels,
from Britain who are persecuting
a new cold war against China,
and also they are looking forward
to incite some kind of long-term
simmering conflict with Russia
in Eastern Europe and in the Black Sea.
How to not fall prey to this,
not demonize China,
understand what Paul Keating said
in the press club in Canberra,
which you quoted.
Well, I thought this was a very apt
and brilliant intervention
by Paul Keating at the time.
While at the same time, maintaining
vigilance and a critical stance
towards the authoritarianism of
the Chinese communist party,
of what they're doing to the brave
students of the Hong Kong Polytechnic,
the Uyghurs, similarly, the
authoritarianism of Putin.
this balance seems increasingly
difficult to maintain.
I find it personally very trying that I
have simultaneously to suffer
the slings and arrows of those who
accuse me of being an agent
of the Chinese communist party, and
you know, some people
who are supporting the Chinese
communist party,
who are portraying me as a stooge
of Western imperialism.
Yeah. How are you handling this?
Do you have any hints?
[Noam] Our priority, always any moral
human being, your priority is:
one should be what you can hope
to change and influence.
I can't change the crimes
of Genghis Khan.
I can protest them,
but I can't change them.
I can protest, and do protest, the brutal
authoritarianism and cruelty
of the Chinese government,
but I can't do much about it.
So the persecution of the Uyghurs
in concentration camps
can certainly condemn by provocative
acts against China.
We only increase the repression, but
we can certainly protest it.
We can cooperate with elements within
China which do exist,
that are seeking amelioration and reform
to the extent we can.
So we can do everything that is
within our reach.
There are other things we can do within
our reach that we're not doing.
So what's happening in western China
is bad enough.
How about what's happening in Gaza?
In China a million people, Uyghurs,
were sent to concentration camps,
detention camps, treated very badly.
In Gaza, a million children are living
in such virtually unsurvivable situations.
Water is poisoned, constant attacks,
sewage systems destroyed,
power systems devastated,
military attacks, any time Israel wants
to do it with US weapons.
Well, we can do something about that.
A lot, we can end it, okay,
So that should be our priority.
Incidentally, we all understand this
very well with regard to enemies,
So take say, Ai Weiwei.
I don't care, you don't care whether
he criticizes US policies.
If he wants to okay, if he doesn't
want to, doesn't matter.
His role is to be concerned with what
he can influence to a limited extent.
China's policies, same with East European
dissidents under the Soviet Union.
We didn't care what they said about
western crimes.
We didn't even care when they
supported western crimes,
as they often did, sometimes in
very ugly ways,
but didn't bother us and
shouldn't have bothered us.
Their job is to deal with the crimes
of their own society,
things they can do something about.
When we can do something to help others
under distress and oppression
should certainly do it, but the main
priority is the main decision
of any moral person is:
What can I influence?
That's what should be my priority.
That's just elementary morality.
I mean if a crime say: suppose I read 
about a crime in, you know Siberia.
I can't do anything about it.
Suppose I read about criminal acts
in the town where I live?
Well, I can do something about it.
Even if the crime in Siberia is worse,
the moral position is the one
you can affect somehow.
That's elementary morality.
As to the slings and arrows,
sure they come with the turf
you disregard them.
[Yanis] Just add one more example to
the ones you gave: Kashmir.
What the Indian government,
the Modi government is doing
to Kashmiri Muslims today, is conspicuous
by its absence from any narrative
of western concern about
human rights of Muslims.
We have this category of
fashionable victims juxtaposed against
the category of unfashionable victims,
depending on the interests of
you know, our great and good leaders
of western imperialism,
to put it differently.
Let me take you to another
completely different setting.
A setting closer to, you know, 
our university background.
I remember back in the day the 1970s
and 1980s in Britain.
I remember I encountered for the
first time the term 'safe space'
and 'safe space' back then, and I
was reminded of that
by a great comrade of ours, from DiEM25:
Rosemary Bechler.
A superb fighter and comrade.
I mention her because she passed away
two weeks ago and left us
feeling like vessels caught up
in a storm anchorless.
But she reminded me some time ago
of what 'safe space' meant back then.
It meant a place where you would bring
supporters of the IRA and Unionists
in one room where they would have
an opportunity
to make each other uncomfortable
through the power of words and arguments.
A remarkable institution, small-scale
institution, but today,
safe space, means something quite
different in our universities,
especially in North America and
in some parts of Europe,
a safe space which causes a
great deal of concern.
Your view?
[Noam] Should cause concern.
Universities should not protect students
from views they don't want to hear.
You can understand the
sensibilities of people.
Like I wouldn't want to have to go
to a lecture which is condemning
kikes for trying
to destroy the Aryan race,
But I wouldn't ban it.
I think if some group of students
wants to invite those people, good,
invite them, set up a counter meeting.
Use it as an educational opportunity
and expose them
and bring students to understand
where that's coming from,
what it's meant, what our attitudes
should be towards it.
That's the way to deal with it, not
creating a space where you can't hear
views you don't like.
That's very effective.
In fact, if you do it, they don't come.
It's shown over and over
or if they do come,
they run off campus, defeated
and students have learned something.
The pressure for safe spaces
is understandable.
The student's sensibilities are real,
it's not invented, it can be overblown,
but it's based on real things.
However, you have to ask what is
the right way to deal with it?
We should also recognize
something else:
the universities have been safe spaces,
safe from the Left that goes way back,
keeping the university clean from the
subversion of people like you and me
who are sometimes tolerated, but kept
very much at the margins.
Take a look at say, economics
departments in the United States
and ask: - until a couple of years ago,
when things eased up a little -
ask how many Marxist economists
could you find?
Could you find Paul Sweezy at Harvard?
Certainly, a qualified economist.
Wrong ideas, got to keep a safe space.
I could mention names, but I won't,
of left economists who kept
their views silent until they got
tenure then, started writing.
That's keeping safe spaces.
It was not just the economics department,
all across the board.
There are people who, former Harvard dean,
McGeorge Bundy,
national security adviser for Kennedy
and Johnson,
people who he called:
'wild men in the wings'.
'You got to keep them
out of the universities'.
He didn't say that, I'm saying it,
but it was done.
The wild men in the wings are those
who go beyond criticizing
US power for tactical errors and
talk about more deeper crimes.
That's wild men in the wings.
He was writing that in 1968,
when people were daring for the
first time to criticize the worst crimes
since the second World War,
US wars in Vietnam.
Saying they're more than mistakes,
they're crimes, gotta stop that.
Well, the universities cooperated and,
in fact, the reaction when the 60s
began to open the door slightly,
is very revealing, very revealing.
So in the early 70s there was an
extremely interesting
important publication, very revealing one:
the first publication of
the Trilateral Commission
- that's liberal internationalists, 
Europe, Japan, United States -
basically Carter administration Liberals.
Carter administration was
drawn from their ranks,
so the kind of liberal international
intelligencia.
They were very concerned about
the activism of the 60s.
They said it was pressing too far.
It was what we would say it: People
were asking for too much democracy.
They were pressing...
- that's their term incidentally -
We need more moderation in democracy.
You shouldn't be pressing for your
rights in the public arena.
Young people, old people, women,
farmers, workers, just keep,
keep to your place, don't press too hard,
too much pressure for democracy.
In particular, they were concerned
about the universities.
They said the universities
are failing in their responsibility
of indoctrination of the young
- their phrase -
not enough indoctrination of the young.
You're not keeping safe spaces, you're
letting these people out there
who are calling for women's rights,
opposing the war in Vietnam,
calling for African American,
American Indian rights.
'Let's ensure better indoctrination
of the young.'
Those are the safe spaces that have
reigned as far back as we want to go,
certainly since the second World War, 
but long before.
Plenty of examples, so the universities
were kept safe, had safe spaces.
It's now an issue because young students
are asking for safe spaces
for something else: safe from racism,
misogyny, anti-semitism, violence,
aggression and support for aggression
and so on.
They don't want that.
Well, it was wrong, then, when it was
overwhelmingly the powerful doctrine.
It's wrong now and it's at the margins.
Always wrong in principle and
tactically ridiculous.
For the left to take over the
tactical devices of the powerful
is both wrong in principle and suicidal.
First, it will be turned against them.
Secondly, it's a gift to the far right,
a wonderful gift.
In fact, the Republican Party
is now running on it
as their main campaign program.
The main campaign is true
for the Republicans
they think they found a winning issue:
is CRT, Critical Race Theory.
Nobody has a clue what it is,
but it's a cover term
and explained as a cover term
for everything we don't like:
women's rights, Native American rights,
opposition to White Supremacy.
All of these things are critical race 
theory, and then you demonize it.
You mobilize parents to say: 'Look what
these anti-American commie Democrats
are doing. They're forcing your innocent
little white child to believe
that he or she is an oppressor
because of her skin color.'
How do you show that you know,
you find some thing that happened
in some county somewhere and
turn it into a national operation.
It's working, you can mobilize
people on that again.
We've had examples.
We've had examples of people...
I don't have to give the examples,
they're obvious enough.
Let's give the example: take Adolf Hitler.
Germany in the 1920s was the
peak of western civilization.
The arts and the sciences is
considered a model of democracy.
American political scientists looked at it
as by Marx: the real model of democracy.
Ten years later, Germans were enthralled
to a maniac who convinced them
that they have to subject themselves
to his ideological commitments
to carry out some of the worst
atrocities in human history.
Same human beings, 10 years.
10 years later, starting to become again,
maybe the most civilized
people in the world!
Well, can happen elsewhere.
Can happen in the United States.
It can happen in Europe and in fact,
as I mentioned, it's happening.
Right now, the Republican party is
concentrating on that as the means
to try to regain what might be
virtually perpetual power.
It's not a small...
It's not an exaggeration.
Not just my opinion.
You can read that in the most respectable,
sober, world journals
like the Financial Times, for example,
Martin Wolf,
their highly respected economic,
political correspondent warned recently
that the United States is in danger
of collapsing as a democracy
and falling under authoritarianism,
more accurately, a kind of proto-fascism.
Well that can happen, but going back
to safe spaces, you're helping that
when you carry out, when you
go overboard,
when you do things that are too much.
They'll be picked up and turned
into propaganda weapons
which will facilitate the forces that
you think you're opposing.
That's what happens.
You can see it before your eyes.
Tactical choices are not trivial matters.
They are matters on which human life
and human society depends,
and you have to take them
thoughtfully and carefully,
often not being done and give examples,
you can give examples.
These are things to be
very concerned about.
Often the - I say almost always -
the motive behind them may be
very decent and very honest, but you
have to be careful what you do.
Not act in ways which are wrong in
principle and provide weapons
to the oppressors and that they're
waiting for, it eager to leap on it.
[Yanis] Lastly, a message for 2022.
[Noam] A message for 22 is
the same as for past years,
was made famous by Gramsci.
'You have to keep pessimism of the intellect,
optimism of the will.'
And there's reason for optimism.
There are opportunities.
Things may look grim, but there are
ways out and we know the ways out.
We simply have to reach enough people,
get them energized enough,
so they'll join and
take over what they can.
[Yanis] And in any case, struggling and
not ending up compromised is more fun
than submitting and ending up compromised.
[Absolutely]
[Laugter]
[Yanis] Noam, thank you so much for
being with us today.
[Noam] Good to talk to you.
[Yanis] It was wonderful talking to you.
And this concludes our discussion
for 2021.
With Noam Chomsky, I bid you farewell.
I implore you to be active within DiEM25,
to stay active in DIEM25
to participate in our campaigns in the
scripting of our new Manifesto.
2022 will prove beyond the reasonable
doubt that DIEM25
has never been as necessary as it is now.
