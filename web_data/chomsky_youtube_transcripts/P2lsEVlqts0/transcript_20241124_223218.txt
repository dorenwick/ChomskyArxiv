Mr Tonky that impotance of Voters that
angry impotance as you talk about
presumably you'd say that is what is
responsible for the rise of Donald Trump
is
it it's pretty clear What U is
responsible for the rise of the support
for Trump and there's General agreement
about it if you take a simple look at U
economic statistics the primary support
for for Trump is coming from uh mostly U
white working class poor people who've
been cast by the wayside During the
neoliberal period they've lived through
a generation of stagnation or
decline real male wages are about what
they were in the
1960s there has been it's also been a
decline in uh functioning democracy the
overwhelming evidence revealed that the
their even their own elected
representatives are barely reflect their
interests and concerns contempt for
institutions uh especially Congress has
just uh increased skyrocketed it's down
single digits often these are people who
U meanwhile there has of course been
wealth uh wealth created uh it's gone
into very few hands Prim mostly into a
fra ction of the top 1% indeed enormous
opulence yes indeed and how dangerous do
you think this all is in terms of Donald
Trump for example I mean he has been
toning down some of his most extreme
pronouncements recently he may if he
ever got anywhere near power he could be
held in check by Congress I me how
dangerous do you think he is to
America well the greatest danger that he
and indeed every Republican candidate
poses is barely mentioned it's kind of
reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes's dog
that did not bark uh the greatest danger
is the there are two huge dangers that
the human species faces we're now in a
situation where we have to decide
whether the species survives in any
decent form one is the rising danger of
nuclear war which is quite serious the
other is environmental catastrophe now
on these issues Donald Trump and the
other Republican candidates are
basically uniform and do you believe the
threat of nuclear and do you believe
that Hillary Clinton the Democratic
front runner would Champion those issues
in a way that would satisfy
you not in any way that would satisfy me
but at least she recognizes that uh uh
climate change is going on and that we
have to do something about it every
single Republican candidate denies that
it's happening with the sole exception
of Kasich who says sure it's happening
but we shouldn't do anything about it
and that's having an impact uh the Paris
uh uh negotiations last December were
aiming at a treaty uh uh they couldn't
reach it for a simple reason the
Republican Congress would not accept it
so it's a voluntary agreement which
means even the weak standards that were
proposed uh will be barely maybe it
undermines the likelihood that even they
will be met uh every Republican
candidate including Trump wants to
eliminate the Environmental Protection
Agency Richard Nixon's Legacy uh to cut
back regulation to race toward the
precipice as quickly as possible on
militarism every one of them wants to
raise the huge military budget already
uh over half of discretionary spending
uh leading right now it's one factor
leading to confrontations which could be
extremely hazardous and briefly I think
this is not being discussed indeed well
I'd suggest one thing perhaps that you
might agree with Donald Trump on uh
would be about the EU I mean he talks
about the fact that the UK may leave the
EU uh you've railed against European
Union bureaucracy could you agree with
him on
that no I don't in fact I actually have
no real strong opinion on brexit but
I've haven't my my concern about it
would be that it would weaken the
European Union but it would also
probably leave Britain even more uh
don't want to use too strong a word
subordinate to us power than it is today
which I don't think would be a good
thing for the world or Britain what in a
nutshell is the answer to who rules the
world
now there are as I try to discuss in the
book there is no simple answer we
usually think of States when that
question is raised and with regard to
States uh there's no doubt that the
United States despite its decline for
many many years is still overwhelmingly
more powerful than any state or group of
states but that's only one factor uh
states have internal structures an
internal distribution of P of power in
the United States power is
overwhelmingly an increasingly in recent
years in the hands of a very narrow
sector of U corporate wealth private
wealth and power so that's and they have
counterparts elsewhere who agree with
them who interact with them largely and
that's another dimension in who rules
the world and there's also the public
the public can have sometimes does have
enormous power we can go back to David
Hume first major modern work on
political philosophy foundations of the
theory of government pointed out that
force is on the side of the governed
those who are governed have the force if
they are willing to and eager to and
recognize the possibility to exercise it
sometimes they do that's a major force
in who rules the world but when it comes
to state power you don't buy the idea of
China as the next superpower the
imminent superpower
China I mean China H China's plays a
very important role in the world
undoubtedly if you take a look at say
per capita income it's far behind the
United States States and other developed
States it has enormous internal problems
demographic
ecological uh resources and so on and
it's uh undoubtedly going to play an
important in military terms it's not
even a fraction of the United States and
Western Powers so it's yes and
economically it's significant but bear
in mind that a good deal of Chinese
production is actually fore unowned
uh Apple world's major corporation
happens to produce in China largely uh
but that's us production uh which
happens to use Chinese uh uh facilities
labor and uh and other facilities so
China is a growing developing power in
some domains in fact it's gone quite far
even in uh high technology industry so
for example it production of solar
panels China's in the lead not just in
mass production but also in Innovation
and high-tech development and all of
this is significant but is by no means a
power on the scale of the United States
in fact take a look at the
confrontations between China and the
United States now there are serious
confrontations uh are they in the
Caribbean are they off the coast of
California no
they're in waters around China where
China and others have territorial claims
those that's a symbolic reflection of
the uh nature of state power well you
describe you're scathing about the
United States no one will be surprised
to hear that um you describe it as a
leading terrorist state I'm just
interested how you'd describe
Russia how I describe Russia
authoritarian brutal
harsh uh carrying out ugly actions in
its own region uh the United States on
the other hand carries out such actions
all over the world in fact again look at
the there are serious confrontations
between Russia and the United States and
once again are they on the Mexican
border the Canadian border no they're on
the Russian Border in fact right at the
point of the uh traditional Invasion
route uh through which Russia has been
virtually destroyed several times in the
past Century Also earlier history again
that's no apologetics for what Putin may
be doing but it's uh should lead us to
to have a a rational perspective on the
relationship between the forces in the
world as for the us being the leading
terrorist State I should say that's
hardly just my opinion uh so for example
I noted when I was introduced uh the in
the person who was introducing me said
that uh I regard the United States as
the gravest threat to World Peace that's
not not exactly it's a little
misrepresents the situation there are
international polls run by the Le
leading us polling agency Gallup its
International affiliate Gallup win and
one of the questions they ask is which
country is the gravest threat to world
peace and the United States is first by
a huge margin far behind in second place
is Pakistan that's undoubtedly inflated
by the Indian vote and others have
slight mention so that's Global opinion
and I should mention that uh uh this is
was not even reported in the United
States happened to be reported by BBC
but wasn't reported in the United States
uh as for being a terrorist State uh
President Obama's uh Global
assassination campaign drone
assassination campaign is an
extreme terrorist War I mean if Iran
let's say was carrying out a campaign to
uh assassinate
people around the world Who would
thought might be planning to harm Iran
uh we would regard it as terrorism for
example if they were bombing the
editorial offices of the New York Times
And The Washington Post which publish op
EDS by prominent figures saying that we
should bomb Iran right now not wait so
obviously they want to harm Iran suppose
Iran was assassinating them and anybody
who happened to be standing around uh
all over would we regard that as
terrorism I think we would well let me
put a few questions to you from people
online um people are sending in
questions via Facebook um first Gary um
says what are the dangers of
ttip of
Putin the dangers no no sorry what are
the dangers of
ttip of T the transatlantic trade and
ship TTI
TTI oh TTI oh yeah oh they're pretty
extreme in fact uh Green Piece a couple
of days ago released uh 280 pages of uh
internal documents on this so-called
trade agreement and U they spell out
details of what all of us should know
the so-called free trade agreements are
not free trade agreements in fact to a
large extent they're not even trade
agreements these are investor right
agreements there's a reason why they're
kept secret from the public and as soon
as you look at them you see why notice I
say secret from the public not secret
they're not kept secret they're not
secret to the corporate lawyers and
lobbyists who are writing the detailed
regulations of course in the interests
of their constituents not doesn't happen
to be the public of the world of their
own countries so these are highly
protectionist uh for the benefit of
private power so-called intellectual
property rights uh uh raise uh
effectively raise tariffs they're called
patents but very which which have an
enormous impact on economies great uh uh
wonderful for pharmaceutical and media
cor conglomerates and others uh the uh
the right the
the investors corporations are given the
right to sue governments something you
and I can't do but a corporation can to
sue governments for harming their future
potentially future profits you can
figure out what that means and such
cases are already in the courts for
they're not in the courts they go to
private trade uh adjudication groups
made up largely of corporate
Representatives they're already going on
with the NAFTA and we can expect more of
them there are uh Provisions that
undermine efforts at U regulation
including incidentally uh regulation of
environmental uh uh dangers and rather
strikingly the phrase climate change
does not appear in these 200 180 Pages
uh which are illustrative of the whole
uh structure so these they have almost
no I should say these these agreements
so-called Pacific and Atlantic have
virtually no effect on tariffs tariffs
are already quite low among the major
trading partners when you read the
propaganda about it it says oh yeah sure
Vietnam's going to have to lower its
tariffs yeah almost no effect on trade
the major trading partners already have
uh agreements that have reduced uh
tariffs very substantially there's a few
exceptions not many so these are Bas we
should disabuse ourself of the illusion
that these are free trade agreements
anything but and to a large extent not
even trade agreements uh we have the
experience of others like NAFTA many
years of experience so take say NAFTA it
has all of the uh aspects that I just
described but even more uh consider even
what is called trade interactions across
the US Mexico border they've increased
substantially since NAFTA so economists
will tell you trade has greatly
increased but have a look at them uh so
for example suppose that uh General
Motors produces Parts in Indiana uh
sends them to Mexico uh to for assembly
and sells the car in Los Angeles that's
called trade in both directions but it's
not it's interactions internal to a
command economy it's as if uh during the
uh days of the Soviet Union uh parts
were made say in Leningrad sent to
Warsaw for assembly and sold in Moscow
we wouldn't call that trade that's
interactions internal to a command
economy well Nome CH chsky thank you
very much for being so generous with
your time and for staying on to have
that live online discussion thank you
