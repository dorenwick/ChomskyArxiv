um
welcome again everyone we're going to
get started in about 30 seconds with our
event
oh
so we'll begin today's event by
welcoming our distinguished guests and
panelists and all of you to this
important virtual discussion
of a book that was released last year
called the united states southeast asia
and historical
memory which is edited by mark pavlik
and carolyn luft
and has chapters authored by our
panelists
that have joined us today for this
discussion my name is brian eiler
i am the director of the stimson center
southeast asia program
and um also the chair of the simpson
center's war legacies working group
which i'm going to introduce it
very quickly um uh in a moment but first
i want to talk about this book this book
sheds crucial new light
on the us engagements in southeast asia
after world war
ii and and that those engagements still
shape the lives of so many in cambodia
laos and vietnam
and in the united states today i read
this book last month in preparation for
this event and i found it extremely
timely even though a majority of the
events the book
explores happened more than 40 years ago
and every time i'm
reminded of the facts that the u.s
dropped more bombs on vietnam
than it did during the world war ii
theaters
um many of those bombs hitting
non-military targets my
inner core is really shaken and then
this book goes on to remind us that
that same statistic was reached um in
cambodia and laos and that is that
that the us bombed cambodia and laos
with more bombs each
than what the the bombing was the us
bombing was
undertaken in world war ii laos is the
most
bombed country on the planet of the
earth and all of it was done
secretly without ever declaring war on
laos
totaled together the number of civilian
casualties uh in these three countries
and across the conflict were in the
hundreds of thousands if not millions
and the book gets into uh to some of
these details
by tying together the vietnam war and
later the 2003
and and afterwards invasion of iraq
along a common thread of unilateral
military aggression the book helps us
think through how far
u.s foreign policy has evolved from the
days when presidents could carry out
secret wars of aggression in cambodia
and laos
and for years doing this with zero
accountability and use their staffers
and their powers to escalate conflict
putting more and more american lives at
risk for little or uncertain gain
last week i listened to an economist
podcast which linked the aggressive
military incursions of the vietnam war
and the iraq war and suggested that the
proponents of
aggressive military action might have
now disappeared from the washington
stage in the post-iraq
post great financial crisis era
noting both the anti-war popularity of
first barack obama
and then also interestingly donald
trump's anti-war campaign so-called
anti-war campaign
as factors that got them elected over
their opponents who were much more
hawkish
and so do we now know that our foreign
policy is absent of
mcnamaras and kissingers and rumsfelds
or do those with the ambitions for
unilateral aggression still walk the
streets of washington dc
and this is something that the book
helps the reader think through
when you read this book the statistics
about the deaths the injuries the
remaining victims of
the conflict affected by unexploded
ordnance and agent orange exposure are
really staggering
and they remind the reader that the us
still has so much to do to reconcile
in this post-conflict era more than 40
years on
and administrations rightfully since the
mid-90s have done much to reconcile with
these countries and help these countries
heal
from the legacies of war but when i read
these statistics i
can't be helped be reminded of the
indifference that americans tend to take
towards statistics like these noting
that now we live in a time of
the coronavirus when more than 227 000
americans have died from the pandemic
and our current leadership
plays down and spins these numbers for
their own political advantages
the stenson center has a long history of
working to address the impacts of
conflict on civilians and
build practical and creative solutions
for more sustainable
and a peaceful future founded in 1989
the stenson center has a 30-year track
record of
working with a broad range of issues to
protect people preserve the planet
promote security and prosperity and
analyze grand strategy in pivotal places
our southeast asia program which i lead
began work in 2018
on the war legacies working group which
seeks to build partnerships throughout
the united
states and southeast asia to address the
consequences of the vietnam war
including unexploded ordnance agent
orange and mine clearance
addressing these consequences of war is
not only the humanitarian thing to do it
creates opportunities for mutually
beneficial partnerships among former
enemies the u.s vietnam relationship
notably one of them we're honored today

so welcome professor noam chomsky
um you have the floor thank you
uh it's now 45 years
since the end of the
vietnam war at least the official end
it's not the end of the war for the
victims
so there are still hundreds of thousands
of
people suffering from the effects of
human uh u.s chemical warfare
in south vietnam that was one
horror that north vietnam was spared
it was the chemical warfare initiated by
john f kennedy in 1961
62 as part of his sharp escalation of
the vietnam war
against south vietnam at that time the
u.s air force was commissioned
to start bombing south vietnam
south vietnamese rural areas under
south vietnamese markings but no one was
fooled
chemical warfare to destroy
crops and livestock part of the
program of trying to drive the
rural population into what amount at the
concentration camps
called strategic hamlets surrounded by
barbed wire to protect them
from the guerrillas the south vietnamese
guerrillas
who the u.s intelligence knew very well
that they were supporting
that was in fact the problem the u.s
internal analyst said the problem is the
south vietnamese
national liberation front what we call
the vietcong
was fighting a political war and they
could do that
because they had the support of the
population we
had no support so we had to fight a
military war
military war was escalated sharply by
kennedy
then more in later years expanded
to the rest of indochina by the late
1960s
the in
laos as was just mentioned the most
heavily bombed the area rural areas
far from anything having to do with the
indo-china war
including the famous ho chi minh trail
were bombed so extensively that to this
day
uh children are being killed by picking
up the
cluster bombs designed
to designed for to maximize civilian
casualties
as strewn all over loves
and in cambodia people are still
suffering
the long-term effects of henry
kissinger's order
50 years ago in which he transmitted
nixon's wishes to the air force
with the words massive bombing campaign
in cambodia anything that flies
against anything that moves but a
challenging uh exercise to try
to find anything in the archival record
that is such a clear call for mass
genocide anything that flies
against anything that moves one of the
consequences was
to turn the khmer rouge from a small
guerrilla group to a substantial army of
enraged peasants
look their revenge and comes more
that's cambodia north vietnam
was so intensively bombed that the
southern part
of north vietnam where people don't
visit was
essentially turned into a moonscape i
happened to visit the
northern part which was bad enough well
that's
peace after the war
at when the war ended in 1975
of course everyone had to write a
commentary on it
uh not quite everyone excluded
were the people who george bundy
the national security adviser for
kennedy and johnson
are the people that he described as wild
men in the wings
that was in a article in 1968 in foreign
affairs where
he said of course there's a lot of
debate and discussion about vietnam but
we'll exclude
the wild men in the wings that is people
who actually
question what we're doing don't say it's
just a mistake
uh or incompetence but actually go on to
question what we're doing
so we'll exclude them but aside from the
wild men and the wings
a whole range of people were able to
produce their judgments on the war and
it was an interesting range
it ranged from what we call hawks to
those
the hawks said we were stabbed in the
back
by the peace movement uh we lost our
nerve
if we fought harder we could have won
that's
the hawks uh ronald reagan was one
leader then that's at the extreme end
you get the doves
probably at the far extreme so i'll keep
to that
is anthony lewis of the new york times
strong left probably as far
to the left as you can possibly go in
the mainstream spectrum
uh he wrote an article in which he said
the vietnam war began with
blundering efforts to do good
why to do good because it's an axiom
you don't have to have any evidence for
it the u.s
was involved so it was an effort to do
good
because it's an axiom that everything we
do is an effort to do good
okay so we don't he needed no evidence
for that
it's just obvious why was it a
blundering effort
because it failed by 1969
he said uh it was clear
that the war was a disaster
that our effort to bring democracy to
south vietnam
could not be achieved at a cost
acceptable to us so that's why it was a
disaster
that's the extreme dovish end okay
then there's other groups like the
population
of the united states there is there are
careful studies of u.s public opinion
on international relations the most
respected ones are the chicago institute
of uh
international affairs council on foreign
affairs
they do annual careful studies of
people's attitudes on foreign affairs
1975 of course one of the questions was
what do you think about the war in
vietnam the answer
70 of the population said the war
was not a mistake it was fundamentally
wrong and immoral so there are
wild men in the wings seventy percent of
the population
are excluded along with the wild men in
the wings who said there's something
wrong with
destroying three countries
that question kept being asked in the
polls
of the chicago council for about 15
years
and the numbers remained about the same
roughly
two-thirds or so said not a mistake
fundamentally wrong and a moral finally
at the end of this process the director
of the program
asked an obvious question what do people
mean when they're saying that
well it would have been possible to put
in a polling question to ask
but that didn't even occur to anyone
because the answer is so obvious
he told us the answer is they think it
was too costly for americans
maybe there's another possibility
maybe this order was fundamentally wrong
and immoral
not a mistake but that's a view that
it can't even be contemplated so of
course that wasn't asked
uh well that was popular attitudes
uh does it has changed like take the
iraq war
there are criticisms like president
obama is uh
greatly respected because he described
the invasion of iraq as a strategic
blunder
okay a wonderful statement
he should be put on mount rushmore now
what he was doing was uh
quoting uh nazi generals
after stalingrad who said two front war
was a strategic blunder should have
knocked out england first
okay that's the
top most respected position uh there are
people who think it was
fundamentally wrong and immoral in fact
a war of aggression of the kind that
uh nazi war criminals were hanged for
but they're out of the discussion they
remain
wild men in the wings uh the
there are retrospective uh
studies of the war by some of those
involved
the most interesting and important is
robert mcnamara's book
mcnamara contrary to what a lot of
people think was
at the dovish end of the spectrum one of
the few people in
power who actually had serious regrets
about what they were doing
all the way through and in retrospect so
reading him is a little bit like reading
anthony lewis
we're seeing as far to the critical end
as you can go
and in fact he was criticized for being
too forthcoming
too concerned with the victims and his
book is quite interesting
he cites lots of american intelligence
and one outside expert bernard full
the most respected military historians
vietnamese historian the one figure who
us intelligence took very seriously so
he quotes full
and here's what he says he says in 1965
when the war was really taking off
sharply uh bernard fall wrote
that the war is directed against south
vietnam
it's killed 150 000 people
uh south vietnam is being devastated
uh but it may not
it's uh the american
attack is sharply escalating with
high technology war against the civilian
population
mcnamara writes that this was
encouraging news
because fall was optimistic he was
thinking
that the u.s force could overwhelm
the civilian population in south vietnam
so that was encouraging two years later
right before his death in combat bernard
fall wrote something else
he wrote that vietnam as a cultural and
historic
entity is threatened with extinction
well in the south the countryside
literally dies
under the blows of the largest military
machine
ever unleashed in an area of this size
mcnamara writes that this was no longer
encouraging
uh because fall no longer felt that
u.s technology could prevail so this was
he had become pessimistic he was
optimistic
when he was describing a hideous
massacre and denouncing it
but said it might succeed so that was
optimistic
but now he's describing maybe the death
the total extinction of the south
but he doesn't think it's going to work
so this is
uh he had become pessimistic now that's
the interpretation of the dovish end of
the spectrum
has it changed well take a look at
u.s relations with vietnam
have a look say at the wikipedia entry
on this
today points out doesn't give the whole
story but
i'll add a little uh the us
imposed an embargo on vietnam to punish
it
for not having been totally destroyed
under the blows of the largest military
machine
ever unleashed an area of the size so we
had to punish it
intensive embargo began to relax a
little with
president bush the first george h.w bush
his view was we're a magnanimous people
so we will agree to somewhat relax
the punishment of vietnam
though we will never forgive the
vietnamese for what they did to us
okay that was george h.w bush
then comes the clinton administration at
that point
john kerry and john mccain senators
both veterans of the war
they began to push towards some kind of
normalization
but there were problems the clinton
administration
had a problem one of the problems was
the infamous letter that
clinton wrote in 1969
when he expressed opposition to the war
and that
infamous letter makes it difficult for
him to make the next step
towards relaxing the punishment
but there were moves towards
normalization
but as h george h.w bush
said the statesmen like bush we can
never forgive the vietnamese for what
they did to us
whether the oceans or others who we
massacred and destroyed
and nor can we forgive the iraqis for
what they did to
us so what's historical memory
just add one little element to it
uh the there's a media specialist at the
university of massachusetts
sutchali runs the communication center
does a lot of public opinion studies a
couple of years ago he did one with
students at the university of
massachusetts amherst this is the
star university with the elite students
asked the many questions one of them was
to estimate
vietnamese casualties during the vietnam
war
the median estimate was a hundred
thousand
that's about five percent of the
official figure probably two or three
percent of the
actual figure that's not counting the
ones who've
been dying after the world well
that's historical memory if you have a
well-disciplined propaganda system
called intellectual culture scholarship
media and so on these are the attitudes
you get
nevertheless 70 percent of americans
thought that the war was fundamentally
wrong and immoral
not a mistake we don't know exactly what
they meant
because the polling experts couldn't
even dream of asking that question
because it's so obvious as lewis pointed
out
that we were involved in blundering
efforts to do good
trying to bring democracy to south
vietnam
by destroying it and overthrowing every
government that didn't
obey our commands but that was what we
were doing
that's the official story and the real
question is
can the population become civilized
enough
to overcome official stories hulk to dug
and try to look at the facts of what
happened which are amply
reported in official documents
in reports by
scholars and analysts people like the
late fred brantford
who brought the love story to our
attention
including some pretty astonishing fact
it's facts that range alongside in my
view of kissinger's
order anything that flies against
anything that moves
the bronfman discovered fred discovered
that
in congressional testimony the top u.s
officials and laws explained why they
were devastating
the rural areas of northern laos the
plane of jars with
massive bombing from which children are
still dying
they had a reason there was a bombing
pause in north vietnam
and they had all this equipment around
in the air bases
with nothing to do so they had to have
them do
something so what they had them do was
devastate
the plane of jars in northern levels
scattered villages where half the people
didn't even know they were in levels
no war going on but we have all these
all these planes around
you can't just let them sit there in the
airfields
so there's that there's anything that
moves against
anything that flies against anything
that moves uh chemical warfare to
destroy crops and livestock
all blundering efforts to do good and
bring democracy to the people
okay if we allow that official culture
to remain unchallenged the future is
very dim
thank you so much professor chomsky for
that
incredible comprehensive overview um
now i want to give our panelists um our
four other panelists a chance to give us
a three to five minute of opening
remarks i'll start with you professor
long
you're on mute
yeah okay uh and speak a little bit
about my piece
uh uh the reason why i wrote my piece
was because
the editor uh mark pavlik
asked me to write a post postscript to
professor
jonesy's piece uh professor james
piece was first published in
a quarterly that i published
and so that's the reason for my piece
now i picked up where professor
chomsky left and that was where his
article
left with the manuals incident
uh in cambodia and
so i picked it up uh because on the very
day
that kissinger was talking about the
mayor was incident and what to do in
cambodia and so forth so on
he somehow found the time to recommend
to the department of the treasury by the
treasury department
to uh impose a very strict
straight embargo on vietnam and the
effects of that
trade embargo went for many many years
later so that's why i mentioned about
that the second thing that i mentioned
was the fact that you know after the
before long before the war and after the
april 20th the vietnamese
both in the uh authorities both in the
north
and the south uh said that they wanted
vietnam
to be reunified but only
in stages maybe in 10 years maybe in 15
years
so therefore they sent two delegations
to united nations
and applied to be two separate nations
christina you know and you know
his advisors and other people wanted to
uh uh basically veto the vietnamese
uh um application
and they went around in a very sneaky
way that i described in my
in my uh chapter so i i won't go into
that
but uh in the end what happened is that
by
september 30th on 1975
the united states vetoed the two
vietnam's application
and what that did was that it it
enabled the hardline people in vietnam
to force
the reunification of vietnam
then the
[Music]
state embargo in vietnam caused
tremendous
economic problems and so the so the
government
of vietnam carried out what was known as
the beginning of the cooperativization
program
that again caused tremendous problems in
vietnam
all the way until about 2000 or so
so these are two very important things
here
then of course the co-optivization
program
got accelerated because of uh
the so-called post-war war which was
uh the war that united supported against
vietnam
uh from 1975 until
the chinese invasion of vietnam and the
chinese invasion of vietnam
first was was stopped uh but
it continued until 1985-86
many people don't know about that so
anyway my pleas
talk very quickly about what happened uh
and so
uh a lot of people see very visible
things but you know things that are not
visible
they don't see uh and
even though and affecting vietnam as
well as flowers and cambodia
continue until way into the mid
2000s uh 2005 to be exact
of course american individuals like
charles minority
and many others helped in vietnam
but u.s policies in vietnam didn't
change
until around 2005 2006
my peace ended with 2005 when the united
states
began to change its its following policy
against vietnam
thank you so much professor long i'll
definitely have some follow-up questions
to that
um uh before i allow
our next panelist to give some opening
remarks i want to remind our audience
to please you know if you have questions
submit them now because we will have a
few
um we will have 30 minutes of q a from
the audience side
so next up um i'd like to invite elaine
to give some opening remarks please
okay we were actually going to start
with tron bobbitt
i can go ahead and um i
as you mentioned sarah i went to laos
for the first time in 2006 as i was
researching
the novel i was writing and i went to
san juan and i was on the plane of jars
with the guide and we heard explosions
going off
and i had no idea that there
that the area was littered completely
with these cluster bombs i
i had i had never learned about that
before and i
was i was there during the war i was in
college during the war so i
i couldn't believe that i didn't know
about it and to be there and hear those
bombs going off was
a very emotional experience for me
and so i went home and i um searched
around because i wanted to do something
to
help with the situation and luckily i
came upon
legacies of war in china and she said
great
drew me in and i got involved as a
volunteer
and then sat on the board as you
mentioned
so um i wanted to help in any way i
could but i
wanted to use my writing skills to help
the group was getting organized and i
wanted to help
write written materials that would be
useful
and so um chanapanai came up with the
idea of writing an
article that would help um
reach a little broader audience because
we felt like there was
not there was very little available
about laos and what had happened
there were history books but a lot of
them i had looked at
didn't even mention the unexploded bombs
and so
we wanted to present something that
would put it all in context
and provide excerpts from
studies that were available and the
information that was was available at
the time
and so we wrote our chapter and i i
started with a brief history so that we
could understand
where how how it laos gotten to this
point that it was
in this war in the civil war and um
because it was so overshadowed by the
war in vietnam
and even in cambodia that no one knew
what had happened in laos
so we started with that and then tried
to
consolidate all the information that was
available
and it was published in 2009 and at the
time
the main studies were from humanitarian
organizations like
humans rights watch and handicap
international and since then quite a bit
has happened and
and new information has become available
so which we did
update considerably for the chapter
in the book so um i think i'll stop with
that for the moment and let
john obasa talk about it thanks elaine
um i just first want to thank uh
legacies and stimson for putting this
together and
for caroline at haymarket uh the
publisher
as well as mark you know we owe him such
a
gratitude for over really 10 years in
the making
to pull all the chapters together and to
do follow-up interviews
so i'm really grateful um for your
perseverance mark
and i'm also really honored to share the
panel with dr long
who um i've come to learn you know in
the
late 60s helped to
translate a lot of the information that
was in vietnamese
only available in vietnamese to a much
broader american public
which is a source of inspiration for me
for your efforts to increase and broaden
the narrative
around the war from different
perspectives and of course charles i
we crossed paths at ford um and then of
course professor chomsky
who i first heard um had traveled to
laos from fred branfman
one of my earliest conversations with
him he had brought of the fact that he
had hosted
you know dozens of journalists um to
meet with the refugees that had fled
from from san quan and he
shared that of all the journalists that
he took to
the sites to meet with the refugees only
two
wept and it was flora lewis of the new
york times
and you professor chomsky and that was
early on before legacies was even
started
and it was really a source of
inspiration
to learn that so many americans had
cared
so many americans had tried to stop the
bombings and to stop the war
um and you know this was in the 80s when
i was
growing up you know none of this
information was available
to me and i was only eight years old and
growing up in a refugee community you
know you
really don't talk about the past your
parents don't talk about the past
um and so there wasn't a lot that we
knew in the broader context of why we
came to the us
the when people did speak it was
about their personal history and often
that was quite fragmented
and so we didn't understand how our
personal and family histories were
connected to this much broader american
context
and so when i met fred it was really
eye-opening because
it gave me an opportunity to look at
things that were happening before i was
even born
um and voices from the plane of jars was
a
source of of inspiration and influence
in wanting to learn more
um but we also you know realize that was
testimonial from civilians you know from
the 60s and 70s
and that we needed to update the
information because people were still
being
killed and maimed but we didn't know to
what extent
and so when elaine and i started talking
about
how we could better educate the american
public today
we had to dig back into not only the
history but to get as much information
as possible about what was being done
so that we can continue to be helpful
in this history and in this process and
so that's how the chapter came about
so in 2009 as elaine mentioned
when this was first published the u.s
was providing merely
about 3 million and then in 2010
there was tremendous congressional
leadership through senator leahy
and his staff tim reiser
as well as on the house side um
congressman honda and fellaini vega
helped to host the first congressional
um hearing on uxo in laos
which was which really helped to educate
and document and have in congressional
you know records uh what was happening
today and
along with folks like meg and others who
helped to testify
and as a result of those efforts um and
in addition former us ambassadors from
laos
engaged by writing a letter to then
secretary clinton
employing her to support to do for the
u.s to do more to support the uxo issue
and so that was the first time that then
funding
um was designated to laos and it went
to 5 million so it was from 3 million to
5 million
and then at that time the lao government
was developing
a national plan to help
address the uxo issue and so there were
collaboration and and and will
to want to address this issue both here
in the u.s as well as as in laos
obviously and then after that we
continued to have congressional
leadership
um in you know 2011 and beyond
money went from 7 million to then 9
million
and then in 2014 it was 12 million
and during those years not only was laos
seen an increase in funding but funding
for demining in cambodia
and vietnam also received increased
support and so there was a recognition
of not only laos but a regional effort
to try to address war legacies and then
of course in 2016
with president obama's visit he made the
90 million commitment which was the
first multi-year commitment and doubling
the funding from 15 to
30 million and so our hope um
when we in the end of the chapter was
that
we that are that legacies and the
partners
um continue to look at
sort of what we consider the principles
for reconciliation
and how we would move forward and these
included
accepting responsibility joint
commitment
from both sides a comprehensive plan
uh continued collaboration and
partnership not only
amongst governments but also ngos and
then
and then transparency of funding and
decisions that were being made
and so that continues to be the
principles by which we
track the progress um of
the the funding and and hopefully
bringing
um you know a sense of peace and safety
uh to the people of laos uh for for
future generations
i'll stop there sarah thank you so much
for that um
elaine charles i'd like to invite you to
um please share some opening remarks as
it relates to agent orange
oh you're you're also mute charles
well thank you sarah and many thanks to
all the previous speakers particularly
professor
chomsky who expresses things in such a
clear and forceful way
i first went to asia at the height of
the vietnam war as a peace corps
volunteer in nepal
and i'd been there in a remote hill
village teaching agriculture
one day i was showing the sixth graders
how to use a
knapsack sprayer and some 10th graders
came along and said
oh that's just how you americans are
killing all the forests in vietnam
i was stunned i couldn't believe it
30 years later almost to the day i'm
in vietnam in the central highlands and
areas that indeed
were still showing the signs of the
terrible devastation
and i recalled this incident and i said
boy they were right in any event that
um agent orange was first my evening job
with the ford foundation
then it became my daytime job
i particularly appreciate the chance to
talk about this excellent book
of the essays on america's indochina
wars
um professor tuang wien's chapter is
about asian orange it's very useful and
i'm going to give you a short
update on agent orange in the u.s
vietnam relationship today
and i want to make three points first
the two countries
remain directly deadlocked in agent
orange for 21 years
from the establishment of diplomatic
relations in 1995
until a break breakthrough occurred in
2006.
second u.s assistance to vietnam and
agent orange began a year later
in 2007 thanks to senator patrick leahy
who made this his personal commitment it
still depends on him
and third while there is progress on
agent orange just
a lot remains to be done the dioxin in
agent orange has
indirectly impacted several hundred
thousand young vietnamese born
and living with severe disabilities they
are the victims
of agent orange well about the deadlock
before
and after diplomatic relations in 1995
the u.s u.s just wouldn't talk about
agent orange of the vietnamese
and when they finally did begin to talk
about 2000
2002 it just led to further
recriminations
and serious ill feelings on both sides
the real breakthrough came in 2006 when
a canadian study
funded by the ford foundation showed
that residual dachshund
dioxin was at threatening levels it's
just a handful of former american air
bases
they could be prioritized for cleanup
both countries accepted these
findings now about the assistance u.s
assistance began in 2007
and since then our aide has walked
forward on two legs helping the
afflicted
and cleaning up the contaminated air
bases
from 2007 to today u.s annual
appropriations for agent orange in
vietnam have totaled 350 million dollars
a quarter of it for disability
assistance
and three quarters for air based cleanup
disability assistance is currently
running at 13 million
a year and usaid is channeling these
funds to eight provinces which were
especially heavily sprayed
in central and southern vietnam within
those eight provinces that give priority
to selected vietnamese
with severe physical and cognitive
disabilities
but there's another issue unlike funding
for unexploded ordinance
successive administrations from bush to
obama to trump
have never put funding for agent orange
into the president's annual budgets
they have left it to senator leahy to do
so in the annual appropriations process
after the president's budget reaches the
congress
leahey's commitment and seniority it
would be a tricky business to keep it
going
and finally my third point uh we're
really just at the beginning we just
started
so what do we need to do now we need to
build ask and advocate
we need to build water support among
appropriators in both the
senate and the house we need to ask
usaid to show
success in its disability assistance and
we need to advocate for sharply
increased annual appropriations for
disability assistance
so that it reaches far more vietnamese
victims of asian orange
we could easily double or trouble the
current allocation of 13 million dollars
a year
and it would still be decimal dust in
the federal budget
thank you
thank you so much charles for that um so
in the interest of time i know that
there's been a number of questions
coming in
directed at professor chomsky and
professor long on vietnam
so um what i like to do is just ask
two questions before i hand the mic over
to brian
my first question elaine and jennifer
you're gonna be in the hot seat um again
um i wanted to ask uh
we know that there were 580 000 bombing
missions
that flew over laos that's equal to over
2.1 million
tons of bombs equaling a plane load a
bomb
for 24 hours a day every eight minutes
for nine straight years
what can we as americans learn from the
experiences in laos that might help us
prevent another secret war
so whichever one of you would like to
take a stab first
oh wow how many minutes or hours do we
have
we had the whole day
you know i think you know what was
interesting was when
when legacies were started in 2004
um it was in the midst of
the iraq wars right and
and we were able to
share the long-term impact of
war in laos to try to prevent
other u.s conflicts
and i think what
the case of laos has has taught many who
uh read about it or learn about it
is just how devastating and for all of
southeast asia
and the wars there it's just how long
term you know it's not
it's not just physical it's the
emotional toll of war
and it cuts across generations
um and you know for
for us who are part of the refugee
population
and communities who have resettled here
in the u.s
you have millions you know of of
americans now
who still remember or
have heard from their parents what what
happened
and are now i think are in positions to
be engaged politically right whereas
when we first came to the us
you didn't get involved with politics
you stayed away from politics because
that's what got us into this
but i think what's been remarkable is
through the generations
um you know the activism
is now being rebirthed
and amongst the now you know refugee
community now immigrant community now
americans now citizens
um and so i think there's a lot of
that experience of coming from war
to hopefully influence um
elections and policies that will
[Music]
improve i think i say american foreign
policy
in a way that
does less harm around the world
let me talk about
uh there's a what apparently is a
historical universal
or very close to it if a country
isn't defeated its
cultural institutions never
concede or recognize the atrocities
they've carried out
you go to england
british triumphalism has reigned
in the school system the scholarship
until very recently it's only recently
in the last few years
that britain has been started barely
to come to terms with atrocities that go
back
centuries france
almost nothing about the you don't read
about the
french you read about france's
civilizing myth admission
in africa if you're french but you don't
read about the
orders of the french commanding general
in around the 1880s
to to exterminate everyone
because they're rising up against france
uh country after country is the same
the united s you you've all seen i'm
sure the
1619 project at the new york times
which caused great backlash how dare you
that they were commemorating 400 years
of vicious slavery the worst in human
history
an aftermath of horrible repression
lasting until today an awful legacy
finally did it why
because public consciousness and
pressure
had increased took 400 years
but it's there we saw it burst out after
the
george floyd murder and maybe that can
happen maybe the united states can be an
exception
maybe we can reach a level of
civilization
which allows us to face the crimes and
atrocities
for which we have been responsible maybe
there's some hope the younger generation
shows
signs of it and i think that's the
optimistic side of this
grim and sadistic story
thank you professor chomsky um on that
note um
i do have a question to follow up to
that um
you know i know that during during the
war
in southeast asia and afterwards
people have worked and are still doing
so to resolve some of the lasting
negative impacts that uxo and agent
orange
has posed on the three countries that
we're speaking about today
um what can today's social movements
learn from the protests that happened
during the war
and what are other ways that groups like
ours the war legacies working groups and
the u.s campaign
to ban landmines u.s campaign u.s
class domination coalition cluster
munition
due to make lasting change
there aren't any magic keys
the answers are always the same whether
it was
abolitionism women's rights
uh opposition to
aggression environmental crisis
whatever you pick is the only answers
are
in front of us nothing new
education organizing
taking actions which can't that are
appropriate to the situation
that judge the circumstances and ask
what will be effective
over time it has an effect let's take a
look at the united states
not your memory but easily mine
in the 1960s uh what was the united
states like
well the united states had laws
against miscegenation which were so
extreme
that the nazis refused to accept them
they only
accepted a watered-down version of
federal laws barred
blacks from federally supported housing
not because the legislators wanted that
but because that was the only way to get
any
public housing through congress the
southern democrats would kill anything
that gave anything to blacks
social security has been a very
successful
project except that 40
of american workers were excluded from
it namely those
in employment where it was mostly black
domestic service agricultural workers
they had to be excluded again any social
security
40 percent of the workforce that was the
60s actually that still is
women were not regarded as peers having
the rights of
citizens didn't happen until 1975.
they were of course anti-sodomy laws
lasting until this century
that's the united states not many years
ago
a lot of this is just unspeakable today
why did it happen because of the wild
men in the wings
those who were bitterly condemned at the
time
of finally had an
impact took time but it did
and the same is true now this has been
true throughout history
it's the wild men in the wings who've
made a difference
thank you professor chomsky um you heard
it folks
advocate continue to meet and gather
and very important in this upcoming
election to vote um
i have one last question before i pass
it off to brian
and this one is actually for you
professor chomsky again
um i know you were in laos as well as
vietnam
and in the region during uh 68 69
with icc or international control
commission
and um there in fred's interview he
mentioned
you rode on a motorbike with him in the
back seat
did he ever allow you to be in the front
seat
oh i said um during 1968 to 1969 you
were part of icc
you took a trip to laos cambodia vietnam
with the international control
commission fred mentioned in his
interview
that you both rode on a motorbike did he
ever allow you to take the wheels
on the back of his motorbike hanging on
for dear life
i wouldn't come here near the wheels
i was there for in laos for a week very
informative
the reason i was in laos was because the
indian bureaucrat who supervised
the weekly trips to north vietnam
was bored out of his life and the only
way he could amuse himself was by
making life difficult for people who
were trying to
do something standard bureaucratic
procedure
so he could delay there was a weekly
trip from
from vientiane to hanoi it flew through
a
u.n special airspace when a propeller
plane
when you were flying through it you saw
a jet plane
zooming around all over the place but
this was a protected corridor
and so i had since he wanted to delay us
i stayed in laos which turned out to be
very useful
when i landed at the airport fred was
there i hadn't known it
but we met each other we spent
practically the whole week together
and i found out all sorts of things
which were available
to anybody who wanted to find out it
wasn't
deep secrets it was all on the surface
i should say that the week i was there
laos
vientiane was flooded with international
reporters leading journalists from major
journals all around the world
why because richard nixon had made a
speech
in which he said that north vietnamese
tanks
were approaching vientiane and were
north vietnam was going to conquer the
country so the whole
international press corps flew in i
don't know if you've ever
dealt with the international press corps
but in a country and say vientiane there
are two hotels
where foreigners could would be so
and if the journalists were all in these
two hotels
most of the time they spent in the hotel
bar
talking to each other then at five
o'clock
they would all go to what was called the
five o'clock follies
where you would go to the american
embassy and get the official news
north vietnamese tanks coming to
vientiane
write the articles go back to the hotel
have a drink in the bar and laugh about
how ludicrous all of this is because of
course none of it's happening
and they all knew it but they reported
the
things i remember one morning i was at
the london
hotel i got up at six there were
a group of uh men there
americans blonde blue eyed tall
kept to themselves uh came
six o'clock in the morning came at
breakfast disappeared
came back in the evening had a drink
disappeared every journalist knew who
they were
they were pilots for air america
the pilots who were flying the murderous
missions
i don't think a single journalist ever
talked to or asked or reported about
them
it's uh fred took me to the refuge the
refugee camps were about
30 kilometers outside of vientiane
not a long trip we made it on his
motorbike
but uh the only journalist who came with
us
was a stringer for the far east economic
review
they were all there that's the story of
what was happening in the plane of
george
i mean there were actually one or two
journalists who went on their own
but the press corps just wasn't
interested that's not the story
i've seen the same in other countries
journalists do their work with courage
and integrity but they're not looking
for the things
that'll tell the wrong story so that's
why nobody knew about it
i mean there were a few harrison cells
very reported
one or two others but almost nothing
so most people just didn't know and if
you don't know
you can't protest and you can't update
it's
much the same in other cases well thank
goodness for those who spoke up
um well thank you so much for that and
it is now time for me to officially pass
the mic back to brian
for audience q a thank you sarah and
um professor chomsky it's just
fascinating to listen to you
channel us back to uh the late 60s to
your visit
uh to laos um
i i'm going to keep us in history a bit
and also ask a question
i'm gonna combine four questions and
pose it to
professor chomsky and also invite anyone
else to answer afterwards
um to this broad question which then has
three kind of detailed follow-ups so you
can see how they're all going to fit
together
a question comes from marianne mendoza
of what approaches should we take to
ensure that our students who are
increasingly further away in time
from the war each year adequately learn
about what happened
during this time and then there are
three kind of sub-questions that come
with this one is that someone asked why
didn't the governments of these
countries of
lao or cambodia do anything about the
bombings why didn't they try to stop the
bombings
another question is is we've read that
um the us offered early in the 50s and
then later
considering the first offering the use
of atomic bombs to france
to end the the war um in the 1950s in
vietnam
and then perhaps considered it later um
what's
what is there any truth behind this um
and then third the question is is you
know could these
these corrupt puppet governments that
were set up by the united states at the
time
um actually be transitioned to
successful governing bodies and that
were democratic
um i'll turn this to professor chomsky
first and then see if anyone else would
like to answer
well let's take laos actually one of the
things that
i did with fred when i was traveling
around laos
was to meet with
cabinet members of the government it was
a right-wing government installed and
backed by the united states
that one of the cabinet mentors
he didn't want me to i wrote about him
but he didn't want to be referred to by
name
so i just described him as a urban
intellectual
that's how he wanted to be but he was
actually the minister of urban affairs
a rich landowner uh talked to him
quite frankly he said he hoped
that the pathet lao the guerrillas would
win
he hated them they were going to kill
him
they were going to steal his land take
his lands he's a rich landowner
but he hoped that they would win because
that's the only way
that laos could be preserved as an
independent country
really an independent culture in society
okay that's the cabinet we met with
savannah puma who was the uh
technically the in charge the rich uh
landowner of right winger we asked him i
was there with a couple of
friends also going to north vietnam
we asked him what do you think about the
bombing in
northern laos intensive bombing he said
it's not happening
that's all there's nothing to say about
it it's not happening
it's just that the air is being invaded
by north vietnam
but there's no bombing okay now you ask
what are they gonna do about it
first of all they're in the pocket of
the united states but suppose they were
independent
take a look at the current world right
now in front of your eyes
okay let's take
u.s sanctions against iran murderers
sanctions designed to torture the people
of vietnam
of of iran killing who knows how many of
them
what does the rest of the world think
about this they're opposed to it
the united states just went to the
security council of the united nations
requesting that the security council
renew u.n sanctions against iran
total opposition not a single
u.s ally agreed total
so what happened secretary of state mike
pompeo
went back to the security council and
said
sorry folks the sanctions are
reinstituted
germany uh france
other european countries are strongly
opposed
are they doing anything about it no
the world is run like the mafia
if the godfather says something
you're in trouble if you don't obey in
this case
the united states can throw them out of
the international financial system
so they observe the sanctions the u.s
has had
murderous sanctions against cuba for 60
years
entire world is supposed to look at the
there's annual
votes in the un general assembly
you can't have it in the security
council or the us v dozen
but in the general assembly they have
annual votes
hundred percent opposition
israel is the only country that votes
with the united states that's because
they have to
does it matter no we impose the
sanctions
the whole world adheres to the sanctions
because if they don't
they'll be punished and punished
severely
okay now when you ask why don't small
countries stand up to the united states
why didn't poland stand up to russia
when it was occupied by russia i mean
you know
maybe they wanted to but what happens if
you do
well that's most of the world now that's
one of the things that americans ought
to learn about
this recent power play at the
security council that'll be front page
news in a free society
let's learn about ourselves we're a
society which
can pick up the bludgeon smash anyone in
the head
and they say thank you okay we should
know about that
thank you dude do any other panelists um
want to comment on
what can we do today to as the distance
increases from
the end of the conflict uh to remind our
youth
about the legacies of war
i would just mention that um i've
spoken at a number of high schools and
when i look at their textbooks
and i see what they have in there they
like
have this little short section on the
vietnam war
and it it may be one sentence that
mentions laos
the kids have absolutely no idea what
happened there
what went on and you know they
they can't put it into context to what's
going on in modern
in their their lifetime so i i think
there should be a real emphasis
on trying to improve education at the
high school and college level
to have materials that are
i'm sure at the college level they may
be better but
certainly at the high school level there
needs to be a real
change in how the textbooks and the
teachers are
presenting all of this so that they can
understand better just my thought
i should say that it's an experience
that i
have very often and when i talk to
classes or
students or others about these things
the first thing i do is
think to myself when i was a
college undergraduate how would i have
felt
if some professor came in and started
telling me about his experiences during
the civil war
that puts you in the right context
we're gonna go to some more pointed
questions now um
uh about agent orange and um uxo
uh uh clearance and contamination at
first i think this one goes to those of
you who are working on
on um increasing u.s remediation
of agent orange and and finding the
bombs
and and and clearing the bombs um
it has to do with the you know how this
is kind of pitched
often that the american public
they appeal to disability
and what disabilities look like so the
question is
that typically this is couched or framed
in terms of
grotesqueness or discussed uh how can we
move past this mobilize activism around
the issue and i think agent orange also
continues with this
without fetishizing disability
i think this is a question for chanapa
or charles or elaine
yeah i think um it's increasing and
expanding the narrative
about who gets to tell the stories right
who gets to talk about the experiences
of what
what is happening in laos or cambodia or
vietnam
and one of the things that legacies did
several years ago was actually bring
a survivor as well as a d minor
to the u.s we did a 12 city tour
17 events around the country where
americans
could hear directly from those who were
living
and dealing with these issues and you
know and that's
that's the most important voice you know
frankly
um and so for us
that helps to
um to humanize
not only humanize right but also
it doesn't weaken right the perspective
of those who are directly affected
and so you know legacies in
my mind when we created this was to
diversify the voices
around the legacies in southeast asia
and to help support and provide a
platform
to empower those who are directly
affected
because i think for so long
we know that the west dominates the
narrative
individuals here dominate the narrative
the press here dominates
the narrative but if we can help
to provide a platform to bring other
voices that are often not heard
from i think that will help
um in not seeing those who are on the
ground as
victims but those who are also capable
of determining their own destiny and
future
for their families and communities and
country
and so um i think that's you know one
strategy that we've always implemented
through legacies and i hope will
continue to do so
may i say something about the effect of
asian orange
and other chemicals here uh we
at the present time uh tend to stress
the birth defects and things like that
but one of the biggest effect of the
so-called defoliation program in vietnam
was to strip the forest of its
vegetation and kill a lot of trees
we have a lot of floods in vietnam right
now especially
in the central part of vietnam some of
that
of course has to do with the cutting
down of the forest and see
recent years some of that has to do with
climate change but a lot of that had to
do
with the deformation program uh i
used the military map maker in vietnam
from 1959
to 1963 and during that time
the the prime for us went all the way
down
to the railroad and to highway one
and any of you who want to do research
you can look
at the u2 aerial maps which is run over
forty thousand
and you can see that this is a fact
after the war ended when they returned
to vietnam
most of the hillsides were renewed
so in the in the past when you had rain
it took two weeks for the rent from the
mountains
to go down to the lowland
after the war it took only six or seven
hours and although the vietnamese tried
to reforest
a lot of the of the denuded areas of
course as i said they
cut the plan for us and this is the
reason why every year
we have a lot of flash floods and we
have a lot of people killed by the flash
floods
so those who are uh interested in
and ver environmental damage can also
bring this thing
to the public let me just add
uh very good points thank you professor
long and
china let me go back to this question of
brian's on how to pitch it uh some years
ago i
um i organized and we funded a
national survey of what people knew
about agent orange in the united states
and we found
several things very briefly one that
nearly eighty percent of the respondents
across the country
knew about it sixty percent correctly
identified the phrase with vietnam
and about one percent knew that it was a
current problem
and this has continued to uh be the case
as i try to get
major media to focus on the
um some of the current stories uh about
it
um it's very hard i would say over in
over a decade of trying
uh no major media there's always
second-tier regional publications
uh radio or tv or podcasts
and i think that's reflected also in the
uh
what is now a sort of a split in the
path
uh with within the state department in
the us government
on the one hand uh the department of
defense is now
helping to fund the clean up of the
massive dioxin spills at the bienwa
airport
along with the state department
and they see this is promoting mill mill
cooperation
and this is good for a variety of
obvious reasons
on the other hand the disability
assistance has been
it's now been 13 years and we
people continue to drag their feet or if
they don't drag their feet they get lost
in the details
of what should be fairly straightforward
it's not rocket science
a thousand dollars per family would
transform
the life prospects of many people
so i think it really comes down to um
you know
does u.s foreign policy uh in any way
respond to what
americans think professor chompki's
point
and i think that we're not there yet i'm
not sure when we will be there
there are still many people who are hung
up on this question of causality
or are somehow stuck in the past there's
been progress
but it's uh it's a tough sledding to get
this
uh the prospects and the possibilities
and the
need indeed the moral imperative for
helping agent orange
victims squarely before the american
people
charles i want to follow up on this with
asian orange victims
and one of our attendees had asked about
how um agent orange impacts the the body
and is it something that is an acute
primary impact or can it be passed uh
from generation to generation and also i
just want to bring in
another question on uh that that came
from up it was the first question that
popped into our
uh q a tab and then dr long and
and professor chomsky noted on him it's
that the us
um has refused to share bombing maps to
a bomb clearance and perhaps some of the
asian orange spraying
roofs um but this is uh that has
the us administration kind of opened
this up or moving forward to provide
more information to improve cleanup
oh yes uh that happened well over a
decade ago in fact
the uh bombing uh spraying runs i can
speak less about the bombing and uh
and now this last year the u.s
senator leahy has added money to assist
the vietnamese
with finding their own mission missing
in action through setting up
genetic testing laboratories and various
other things
and this is another positive step
forward
but in terms of where the spraying was
carried out yes
on our website you can find all that
information the vietnamese have had it
for
over a decade um now
the other question about the impacts the
health impacts
i think you can distinguish between
people who are directly exposed that is
who were on the ground and alive
between particularly in 68 69 the height
of the spring
and then went on to have children and
they indirectly exposed their offspring
or the offspring of as much smaller
number of people who have been living
around
uh two or three diox and hot spots these
former
us bases that are being cleaned up and
uh in the first group it's really the
same story as with
our own veterans of the vietnam war
they use the same list of diseases
to qualify them the government of
vietnam has a
spends about 230 million dollars a year
assisting people who have
these uh maladies and diseases and
complications
uh both to directly expose and their
children and and
grandchildren the science is often in
dispute
but the overwhelming burden of people
who are born
is severely disabled and the
and the fact that it uh is unusually
high
incidents in areas that were heavily
sprayed despite the passage of 50 years
it is important to consider in most of
all the feelings of the vietnamese
people
who believe that something should be
done the us has dragged its feet
it's now beginning to do something a bit
more would be
very welcome and brian just on the
data strike records for uh for laos and
i think cambodia as well
there was the declassified data strike
records under clinton
it was released and then as part of the
90 million obama commitment
there's a national survey that's also
taking place in laos
to get updated
updated information around where the
actual
effectiveness of clearance will be um
since we also know that the data strike
records weren't always accurate
thank you for that um we're going to
move into the final portion of our
uh to close this event down i think
we'll go to about 35 after the hour
um and i'm going to ask professor
chomsky a final
set of questions that again are kind of
a composite of
numerous questions that have come in if
you're paying attention to the q and a
list
a good 30 percent have to do with great
power competition
and increasing tensions between us and
china so i'm going to start with
cambodia
um i was part of a conference a public
conference two days ago where
u.s ambassador cambodia patrick murphy
um whom i'm a big fan of um was talking
about the mekong region and
u.s engagement in the mekong which has
ticked up recently
energy engagement obviously we've been
talking about
um war legacy engagement as well and the
major improvements there
the list actually grows quite long and
he said clearly
that the mekong region for u.s foreign
policy
is not a sideshow and when that word
sideshow popped in
it popped out you know automatically i
thought about how nixon described
the the war um the u.s bombing in
cambodia and our actions there
which you know were a part of great
power competition and then resulted
uh the subsequent results were also kind
of a residual effect
a horrible residual effect of great
power competition
i wonder if you could run us through
this very briefly and then also perhaps
expound a bit on
u.s decline whether a u.s in decline
will
be likely to take on a more aggressive
policy in the pacific
um in the indo-pacific and southeast
asia and
what southeast asian countries can do to
prevent
a new cold war or more conflicts from
happening
and she mentioned the mekong delta
it's worth bearing in mind the
analyses by prominent climate
scientists the mekong delta is facing a
disaster
it's it's the mekong delta had
rivers pouring in which have been able
to
hold back the sea
making the region very fertile because
it was irrigated by the waters that's
declining
the sea is the rivers are declining
partly dams partly global warming
the sea is encroaching the whole region
may become unlivable but
and don't forget that when you talk
about
policy the united states is alone
in the world in moving to accelerate
the rate of the devastation from global
warming
that has to be changed has to be changed
on november 3rd
it's coming very close uh what about
american decline
well it's true that the four years of
president trump have significantly
harmed the united states in the
world system it's now considerably
less influential than it was uh when
trump came in but it has enormous power
what just happened at the security
council as i mentioned
a few weeks ago is one of many
illustrations
we should be there's plenty of things
wrong with china
real crimes being committed internally
harsh authoritarian state many crimes
lots to question about their foreign
policy
but the fact of the matter is
they're not alone we have plenty to
answer for it too
i don't usually agree with president
trump
but when he answered a question about uh
what are you going to do about you know
russian crimes or something he said we
have
some to answer for too he was harshly
attacked for that
that's one of the sanest comments in his
administration
the uh but uh we have to cooperate
it's a fact if we don't cooperate with
china
we all go in to fall into the dust
every major issue whether it's the
pandemic global warming
nuclear war you name it
these are international problems and the
two
major international forces are the
united states and china
the united states is much more powerful
it's
reach around the world is much greater
we should bear in mind for example that
uh 50 of world wealth
is in the hands of multinational
corporations based in the united
states basically owning half the world
there's never been any power like this
in history
but it is declining and
we can make it decline we can make it
benign
we have to work together with china
on issues of critical importance to all
of us
the china bashing that's going on this
is bipartisan incidentally
just has to stop we have to work
with china for if you can't think of
others even for our own benefit so there
has to be a sharp reversal
in this these policies there's plenty of
things that
china should do we can't do much about
them
there's a lot that we can do we can do a
great deal about it
and one of the things we have to do is
move towards
cooperation with the other major great
power
i don't think there's any alternative to
that if we
hope to survive
thank you professor chomsky it's been a
real uh honor to host you
here i think on behalf of my
co-facilitator sarah
sarah colladra and myself we've learned
so much
uh from your commentary uh you remind us
that we do have better angels inside of
us but also
shed light on the darkness too that can
come forward
this has been a real treat and a real
learning experience and i also want to
extend thank you to all of our panelists
who have brought in some very pointed
issues and very relevant issues of the
the need to continue um to remediate the
legacies of war that will continue to
linger
uh everyone else i encourage you all to
find this book um we've dropped the link
into
the chat line the united states
