all right hello Professor Chomsky can
you hear us
thank you so much for generously taking
the time to meet with us
um but beforehand I just want to give
a short introduction
um firstly I would like to acknowledge
that we are in the traditional land of
the Pokemon band of the Tommy
um and I just like to give a short
introduction about Noam Chomsky who is
one of the most influential and
important thinkers of our time as well
as one of the most sightest Scholars
um he's considered by many as the father
of modern Linguistics and he has led to
cognitive Revolution which radically
transformed many different fields
um not limited but including Linguistics
psychology philosophy and so much more
but more importantly he
um has been one of the most foremost
critics of American imperialism and
state capitalism and he has inspired
countless activists around the world
um including us here at solidarity ND by
always being an invaluable voice for the
voiceless
calling out and condemning injustices
and tirelessly advocating for human
rights and basic human decency
so is for that reason that we are
incredibly elated and grateful that he
has generously taken the time to speak
with us about student activism here at
Notre Dame uh here to introduce event is
Tiana Zhang
thank you Andrew for that wonderful
introduction my name is Tian La Zhang
I'm a junior majoring in the philosophy
in philosophy and the program of liberal
studies
I'd like to express my gratitude to the
program and Dr Eric bogus our advisor
for facilitating for facilitating this
event through the department and of
course to Dr Chomsky for spending the
time to engage in dialogue with us today
however it should be noted that the
original motivation for this dialogue
arose not as a top-down initiative from
the Department rather it began as a
series of conversations between members
of our Democratic Socialist student
group here at Notre Dame solidarity ND
conversations with centered on our
Collective hope of learning lessons from
past few months so as to apply them to
the struggles of today
hence the theme of our dialogue today is
student activism and it is my sincere
hope that future radicals who find
themselves here at Notre Dame be they
undergraduates graduate students or
faculty will be able to return to this
dialogue as an eminently practical
Resource as an aid in reflecting upon a
few concrete questions facing the
student movement
in his classic 1967 essay the
responsibility of intellectuals
Dr Chomsky opens with a retrospective he
recalls rereading a series of Articles
published by an activist intellectual of
the previous generation Dwight McDonald
who posed one such concrete question
which despite being first written in the
40s has lost none of its significance
today
perhaps now is an appropriate time to
revisit it once again
as intellectuals in Dr chancey's words
as intellectuals who have a
responsibility to speak the truth and to
expose lies as intellectuals who are in
a position to expose the lives of
governments to analyze actions according
to their causes and motives and often
hidden intentions and as intellectuals
always given the option to either
produce or to critique the ideology of
powerful social institutions
we must always ask ourselves what have I
done
for McDonald during the second world war
what have I done for Chomsky during the
Vietnam War what have I done and for
those of us confronted with that very
same question today
what have I done
I hope that this dialogue will in a
small way contribute to each of us
finding that answer for ourselves
the format for the dialogue will be
simple over roughly the next hour we
will pose questions to Dr Chomsky that
arose from our student-led discussions
over two of his seminal articles from
the late 60s and early 70s the
responsibility of intellectuals as I
mentioned earlier as well as in defense
of the student movement written in 1971.
and if there is enough time we'll also
open up the discussion to audience
questions
Dr Chomsky
thank you again so much for joining us
today my first question to you is this
in your latter essay in defense of the
student movement uh you you urge the
students and faculty to understand that
freedom in the University exists but is
very badly misused that these places are
relatively free decentralized
institutions in which serious
discussions are very largely made by
faculty and very largely at the
departmental level
from this analysis you argue that
students and faculty have the freedom to
either put their talents to the service
of powerful institution Society of
society or to resist and to organize for
things like radical scholarship and
abstention for more
however three things have happened since
1971 to dramatically change the
structure of the University
first the rapid increase in tuition
which has saddled students with debt
thereby reducing their freedom to
organize second the rapid restructuring
of the University labor force increasing
amount of adjuncts decreasing tenure
tracks and generally making academic
labor much more precarious and third the
rise of the administrative class which
has taken an agency away from students
and faculty given these conditions which
you still characterize the university as
a place of relative freedom for students
and faculty today thank you so much
well first of all they should mention
that
these developments or that you describe
quite accurately are part of something
far broader
uh they're part of the whole
reactionary wave
began
with
at the
level of discussion and ideology in the
1970s
and began in policy terms in the late
70s early 80s it's the whole
neoliberal
reaction which taught to among other
things to undermine the uh
the
activism of the 60s and the
civilizing effect if it had that it had
on the society
that caused a lot of concern among
Elites across the political Spectrum I
don't know if you've read it but if you
haven't I'd suggest that you take a look
at a book called the crisis of democracy
which appeared in 1975
it's a reflection it's an expression of
the views of the liberal
internationalists
basically the quarter Administration
which was
in the U.S a group drawn from the from
this organization it's the trilateral
commission liberal and nationalists
internationalists of United States
Europe Japan
basically Carter in the United States
the uh
repertoire for the American delegation
was Samuel Huntington it was a professor
of political science at Harvard a kind
of a Kennedy
uh
a liberal they are the crisis of
democracy that they saw
was that in the 60s
there was too much activism
too many people young people
uh
departed from their normal stance of
passivity and obedience tried to enter
the political Arena to press their
demands women
young people the labor and farmers and
basically the whole population
and that was of caused a problem they
felt remember I'm speaking at the
liberal end of the spectrum the problem
is it's too much pressure on the state
it can't respond to all these uh demands
so therefore we should have more uh
called for more moderation and democracy
go back and be quiet and passive and
don't disrupt things with regard to
regard to the universities
it said the problem of the universities
is that it referred to the river and
universities as the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young
that's the universities they're
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young
they haven't been doing their job that's
why you see these young people in the
streets uh opposing the Vietnam War
calling for women's rights
in general a
moving into domains in which they don't
belong
therefore it called for improving the
universities so as to not allow these
possibilities
well that was the expression of a very
general view it was much harsher on the
right you can find it in the hell
memorandum which you can find on the
internet that's the right wing
counterpart to this but it's set in
motion the processes that you describe
tuition started going up business models
were imposed on the schools and
universities uh more rigid curricula
teaching to test
defunding
radical defunding especially as a state
and state colleges and universities all
of these developments that have gone on
in the last 40 years the goal is to
improve the indoctrination of the young
and to keep people like you where you
belong in your seats not interfering in
the Affairs of the world not
demonstrating about
climate change
nuclear war or whatever happens to
concern you so it's not and it was
associated with
policy actions that actually began in
the late Carter Administration but took
off under Reagan called neoliberalism
actually a form of pretty Savage class
war what we've been living with for the
last 40 years all of this is of a piece
so these things didn't just happen they
were planned organized
or
fit together in a very general pattern
it's a kind of massive class war to try
to restore the
domination of the traditional powerful
classes including the intellectual
groups that serve them and put an end to
this disruption and uh
nuisance of people trying to press their
demands in the political Arena to change
policies
well
nevertheless despite all this
what you quoted before it remains true
by comparative standards the
University's remain
quite free we're free to have this
meeting
you're not going to have
Stormtroopers come in and grab you take
you away there's you can have the
I teach courses at the University of
Arizona now I used to teach at MIT
but I teach courses freely on social and
political issues that
the legislature in Arizona doesn't like
it the a lot of the faculty doesn't like
it but
they don't stop it
that's an arena of relative Freedom
which we can do lots of things now we've
seen it it's had an effect
so if you take a look at
the major issues of the day
nothing more important than
destroying the climate who's out in the
league trying to do things about it
Sunrise movement
Extinction Rebellion
uh
Global Climate strike
young people
mostly from colleges and universities
so it Remains the center for
activism as a spin was in the 60s and it
very commonly is if you look through
history it's often the case that people
basically of your age and position have
been in the lead in activist work to try
to improve the world
and it's not too surprising if you think
about it
this is the period of a person's life in
which they're most free
most independent
out of parental control
not yet in a position where you have to
worry about putting food on the table
well it's a position of relative Freedom
free to explore to inquire
it's a good special time of life it's
quite right that it should lead to
activism and engagement and Affairs of
the world and it's quite understandable
that liberally leads would be upset
about the failure to indoctrinate the
young which is the task of the
universities as they see it so this is a
conflict that goes on persistently it
takes different forms
and it Remains the case luckily for us
that the universities are
an arena of considerable freedom and
opportunity good chance to take you to
make use of it
all right thank you so much thank you
Professor Chomsky for your answer
um so my question is in your essay in
defense of the student movement you
discussed how the University's
politicized by his association with
repressive institutions which you
identified as the result from the
national psychosis that developed during
the Cold War
uh my question is how is this implicit
politicalization manifests itself during
today's post-cult War era
um for example the corporate the
corporatization of education and the
entrenchment of Rossi programs
um furthermore what are some ways to
combat these new forms of
politicalization of the University
the way to combat is by using the
freedom that the university offers
make use of that freedom to organize to
try to achieve the kind of educational
programs that you think are appropriate
that you want
to Foster the kind to give thee a place
for the kind of activism that will be
committed to dealing with the crises of
the world I should say that we're
in a different position today than we
were
when this discussion that you're quoting
took place
they were very serious problems then
very serious
nothing like what we have today
today we have crises
of a kind that have never Arisen in
human history
never
and if we don't answer them deal with
them it'll be the end of human history
it's not just my judgment take a look at
the
the famous Doomsday Clock
over the bulletin of atomic scientists
I'm sure you're familiar with it the
domesday clock was established shortly
after the bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
the hands of the clock were said a
certain distance from Midnight
midnight means essentially termination
of organized human life on Earth
and every year every January now the
analysts scientists political analysts
and so on get together try to give
a general assessment of the world
security situation and set the hands of
the Doomsday Clock accordingly
1947 they were set at Seven Minutes to
Midnight
1953
they moved to Two Minutes to Midnight
that's when the United States and the
Soviet Union
excluded thermonuclear weapons which
showed that human intelligence had
reached the point where it could destroy
everything
after that it's been oscillating
depending on assessments of the world
situation
in the Trump Administration it went back
for the first time to Two Minutes to
Midnight
2018 the next year still in the Trump
Administration
uh the
analysts abandoned minutes moved to
seconds
so now it is sit now at 100 seconds to
midnight
in January I anticipate that they may
move the second hand even closer to
midnight
I think that's a pretty fair assessment
of where we stand
they identified
three major issues
one is the traditional issue of the
threat of nuclear war now increasing
second is the
existential threat of heating of the
atmosphere
getting worse
and the third is a the collapse of an
arena for rational discussion and debate
first that may not sound like it belongs
with the first two but it does
because that's the only hope for the
dealing appropriately with the major
crises
that's your situation today
the University universities or the
most
appropriate uh
supportive place for creating an arena a
free rational discussion and debate
there should be in the lead in this they
provide opportunities not found
elsewhere shouldn't be the only places
of all kinds of other associations labor
movement other groups should be involved
but the universities have a preeminent
position
and they are now that means you are now
facing the kinds of questions that did
not erase in the early 70s
serious as the times were then and that
have never Arisen in human history
these issues will be resolved in the
Next Generation
or never that's quite a challenge
that's never risen before and
like it or not it's the challenge you
have to face
uh under situations which are
circumstances which are not ideal but do
offer plenty of opportunities
hello can you hear me
my name is Hiram Zhong and I'm from
South Korea and I'm majoring in
political science
so you wrote that the search for
confrontation clearly indicates
intellectual bankruptcy that in reality
the idea of competition tactics is often
a confession of the inability to develop
effective politics or the unwillingness
to do the series and hard work of social
reconstruction that can easily be
condemned as reformist
however in my experience even without
searching for confrontation by engaging
in activism or without engaging in
Activision in like recently in Korea the
president Yun he tried to uh enact
the uh presidential decree that
presidential security service control
the police and military service too so
like this one like the confrontation
eventually been in cup will encounter
confrontation from the police
so how should student activists act when
they encounter rather than sick or
searching confrontation
I don't think there's any
General answer to such questions
and I think the
specific answers
simply have to be given by people who
are on the scene
familiar with existing circumstances in
a position to evaluate the likely
consequences of what they do
uh
any kind of activism the first question
you ask is what am I trying to achieve
uh well you could be many different
things
but you
if what I'm trying to achieve is to
bring other people to join me
in the kinds of things I'm trying to do
we have to ask how my actions are going
to affect that
or my actions going to alienate them and
drive them away or will my actions
and
Inspire them or encourage them to
participate in some form and what I'm
trying to achieve
there's no General answer to that
question
there's no right absolute right or wrong
about it
you have to adjust the actions to the
circumstances and the goals you're
trying to achieve and the answers have
to be given
with people who have set those goals
and can or in a position to evaluate
will the likely consequences of what
they do
but there's no textbook answered
I could give you examples from the past
which are quite striking
these questions have always arisen
let's go back to the period you're
talking about around 1970.
sync with the issues were then
there were many but one of the dominant
issue was the destruction of Indochina
and though China was being virtually
destroyed by the United States
the leading uh historian of Vietnam
highly respected in government circles
leading Vietnam historian military
historian or north falls no Dove
incidentally
it's an early couple years earlier 1967
he wrote
that he wondered whether Vietnam could
survive
as a cultural and historical entity
under the blows of the most powerful and
destructive military machine ever
launched against an area of this size
I was talking about the American War
primarily against South Vietnam
partially against the north boy then
already in Cambodian Laos that was 1967.
we were talking about 1970 got much
worse
well at that time a lot of people your
age young people felt this is so
horrendous
we just can't sit by and just talk about
it and have peaceful demonstrations
about it we have to do more
we have to Smash the Place up we have to
March down Main Street and break windows
we have to confront power violently
weatherman it's the Weather Underground
many kids I knew very well very good
people very sincere very honorable
destroyed themselves
harm the movement
that's not all that they succeeded in
doing was encouraging support for the
war
well let's see what your feelings are
are not enough you have to ask what the
consequences are of Your Action
I should say at about the same time
I was attending meetings
of
South Vietnamese
women mostly
couldn't come to the United States of
course but we met in Paris
uh they met with peace activists
and the kind of Acts that they proposed
and encouraged
were so mild
that American activists would have
laughed at them
to remember one person these are people
coming remember from the country that is
being wiped out devastated by hideous
Terror
things you read about like the myth eye
Massacre were
icing on the cake they were almost
nothing like what was happening
horrendous addresses
they're coming and telling us what they
want us to do
they said what really impressed them was
when a group of American women
stood silently at the graves of
Fallen American soldiers
that's what they thought was really
impressive because they were not
concerned with how we felt they wanted
to survive and to survive men bringing
the general American population
into
agreement to end these horrifying
atrocities well these are the kinds of
questions that constantly arise
not enough to feel good you have to do
good that's what matters
and that requires sensitive attention to
the likely consequences of the actions
you undertake
good afternoon professor
you observed in defensive student
movement that any serious movement for
social change LED to involve many
different strata of the population
including many groups who are in no
position even to articulate their goals
and needs and certainly not to bring
them to public attention or develop
political action based on them
but the goal of the student movement
movement attempting to understand and
articulate these goals
to try persuade and organize and
ultimately to act collectively where
they can individually if it comes to
that
or the ways that students can begin to
approach different social groups
particularly in a campus like Notre Dame
where we are so isolated from the local
community and furthermore with the
danger of paternalism in students
claiming to speak for a community
especially from our own privileged
positions as students
just think of how students
many interesting ways
let's go back to
a little bit earlier than we've been
discussing let's go back to 1960
early days in Civil Rights Movement
what were students doing
well
snake
student non-violent Coordinating
Committee Young
students mostly black
in the south
were writing Freedom buses
no joke endangering themselves
some were killed
going through
places like Alabama Georgia
trying to
encourage black farmers
to
of the to take their fate in their hands
and register to vote which could have
meant death
and support them in these activities
they weren't paternalistic they were
engaging with the poor and they
oppressed and seeking to provide the
services that they could to them
let's go a couple of years further
to pick the 1980s
the 1980s with the time of the most my
view the most important popular activist
movement ever
so important that it's been wiped out of
History
students were
heavily involved in it I'm talking about
the Central America solidarity movements
the United States at the time was at war
with Central America
Ronald Reagan was carrying out
horrendous terrorist Wars throughout
Central America
hundreds of thousands of people were
killed
many more almost a million tortured
driven out of their homes and every
imaginable form of atrocity that you can
think of uh
the United States was even brought to
the world Court charged with
International terrorism of course it
rejected in
uh
Americans did protest but in a novel way
something that had never happened before
thousands of people here many young
people
my daughters to give two examples but
many others
went to
live with the victims to work with them
to try to support them to try to help
them
even to give them the kind of
limited protection that you get when
there's a white face and the state
terrorists they're mostly sterile State
terrorists Army Security Forces
paramilitaries
let's back off a little bit
well some were killed some suffered that
had never happened before in history
nobody during the Vietnam war ever
thought of going to live in a Vietnamese
Village
to try to provide some help and
protection to the people under attack
during the French Wars in Algeria also
hideous atrocities like all colonial
wars nobody in France there were there
was protests but nobody went to live
with Algerian villagers
and it was all over the country
noted in from Notre Dame as well I
remember groups uh Church groups
Evangelical churches churches in Canada
Midwest and Kansas and Rural Maryland
from all parts of the country were
carrying out these
remarkable activities remarkable
engagement
wasn't patriarchal I was going to work
with people
uh help them give them
the
kind of help that people who are more
privileged who have skills who have
education things that they can do that a
poor villager can't do well these are
the kinds of things that can be done
and can be done in poor communities here
I've been in very poor communities in
where
young people have gone to work
to live to help to try to organize to
try to build community actions
often with some success
so there's all kinds of things you can
do
doesn't have to shouldn't be can't be uh
I'm smarter than you I'll tell you what
to do I'll be your voice not that
I can help you I have skills I'm willing
to be part of what you're doing I'll
learn from you just as you'll learn from
me the way good education ought to be a
mutual
interaction
all of those things are possible they've
been done in the past they can be done
right now no matter where you are
thank you Professor
um now I'm going to pull up a video that
was pre-recorded
um and uh it's one of the questions that
um someone had that couldn't join us
here today
um but um we couldn't quite get the
audio uh transcription to work so I'm
just gonna send you the text of the
question through a direct message as
well
foreign
hi my name is Fabrice uhirgue I am an
economics and Global Affairs major
um with a minor in poverty studies and
um I'm involved through solidarity ND
and I just like to thank you again for
coming today Dr Chomsky
um so you know towards the end of um in
defense of the student movement you turn
towards um concrete ways in which
students organized radical programs
within the university and um among other
examples uh you mentioned the creation
of you know radical and objective
scholarship within the academy as well
as organizing scientists to refuse uh
military work
so my specific question is you know what
other
um creative and effective programs have
you personally seen
um as a scholar and an activist during
your time thank you
well
let's
take
let's go back to those days the early
70s
one of the things that happened was uh
it's called the student action
Coordinating Committee
a lot of it was at MIT where I was
the very active student body in those
days
it was a group of young scientists
students
mostly young graduate students
physicists engineers
decided to form
uh
not just to refrain from military work
but to become directly engaged in what
was called science for the people
using scientific knowledge
organization to try to help people's in
who could benefit from these activities
many of them did so
some of them went and formed a group
called Union of concerned scientists
still exists very Lively and active it's
an activist Group by now of senior
scientists who play a very significant
role in matters of disarmament and
peace other things where scientists were
having scientific knowledge and
does enable you to enter directly into
influencing policy decisions others just
went into communities
one
grad student physics friend of mine went
off to live in a community in happened
to be in Cape Cod Massachusetts
he
went there as a teacher basically
science teacher
trying to see what he could do in the
community that would be helpful for
organization
one of the things he discovered was that
there seemed to be a lot of
cancer in the community
you looked into it he found out he
started a significant study using
this Cape Cod Community College bringing
students and faculty into an inquiry to
see what's the cancer problem well what
they discovered was quite interesting
turns out that Cape Cod the water in
Cape Cod comes from an underground
aquifer
anything that poisons the aquifer will
hit everybody
there's a military base there
turns out the military base was spilling
jet fuel and other pollutants which went
into the aquifer
as they did studies they showed that the
incidence of cancer
depended on the flow of the aquifer
the closest you were to the military
base the higher the rate of cancer
they began an activist effort to try to
compel the military base to end their
activities to end the pollution and
destruction
involved quite a lot of the community by
then
once the community was organized they
got involved in other activities too
and finally I won't go through the whole
story but there was enough pressure to
get the secretary of the Air Force it
was actually an MIT graduate to
agree to impose sharp restrictions and
ends pollution and even provide some for
the government to provide some means to
cure the people who were harmed This Not
only was a very important activity in
itself but it energized the communities
to do other things
well
that's one example of many of the kind
of thing that young students in the
scientists did at that time not just
let's not work on Military work but
let's do something constructive with our
capacities and abilities and it's had a
major effect
ongoing significant groups like Union of
concerned scientists many activities
throughout the world throughout the
country also educational activities
courses dealing with how to apply with
the social use of Technology
just to give you one example the
pressures within MIT where I was were so
strong since by student activism that
the administration
set aside a whole day
March 4th
1970 69 I think it was
set one day aside no classes just for
talks
seminars
meetings on the social use of Technology
what are we doing with their technology
are we using it to destroy or to help
MIT was a major military contractor
remember
this was very important it set in motion
it it was part of the way in which some
of these organizations spawned some of
these organizations
organized students to do things that was
all inside the university
also led to a lot of changes in the
academic curriculum courses concerned
with these things and a strong shift in
attitudes
these questions had never Arisen before
50s and 60s
and starting until the late 60s
students just did their work
faculty did they work correctly nobody
asked what are we doing
well that was a big change
and it's had a spreading effect you can
do that right where you were
it was a small group of
activists maybe half a dozen of them who
started many of them have continued this
work for the rest of their lives still
are doing it
people like if some of you are involved
in the
Z Communications system organized by
Michael Albert
he was the leading student at the time
still devoted his life to it in many
other ways many other activities and
there are others
I'd like to ask one more question from
our group before we open up to a few
questions
um from the audience if that's all right
um
so
as this event was hosted by the program
of liberal studies which emerged out of
the great books movement I would be
remiss if I did not ask this last
question in the response in the
responsibility of intellectuals you have
an understanding of the traditional
intellectual the ideological type still
concerned about irresponsible questions
such as the Moral Moral issues and human
rights over the traditional problems of
man in society and who are thus still in
a position to critique the excesses of
American imperialism however however
this class is becoming endangered due to
the emergence of the new breed of the
scholar expert who jealously guards
their specialized knowledge as a way to
protect their class position in
reproducing State ideology
my last question is this how should we
understand and navigate this dichotomy
today and do the liberal arts have a
progressive role to play in politics
within this dichotomy
the liberal arts should
free your minds to inquire
to evaluate to create
two
understand the
great contributions of the past the
great failures of the past to think them
through to ask what we can do to carry
forward understanding of the world
understanding a society and find ways to
change and improve the world
that's the rule of the liberal arts it's
one of the reasons why the liberal arts
are under attack
there's very strong pressure from right
wing
elements around the country and state
legislatures and elsewhere
to undermine liberal arts and to direct
students to the kinds of to basically
vocational
vocationally oriented activities
just would take the kinds of courses
that will help you get a job and find
your place within the established
Society not the kind of courses that
raise the kinds of questions that you
just raised not those things we don't
want students to be thinking for
themselves that's dangerous
that goes back into
Classical Greece as far back as you can
trace history go back to Athens
Classical Greece ask yourself
who was the man who was forced to drink
the hemlock and commit suicide
Socrates what was his crime
his crime was
disrupting the Youth of Athens by asking
them too many questions
by asking them to think about question
things that's dangerous when people
start thinking about things the
structures of power begin to dissolve
illegitimate hierarchies are challenged
you move forward towards a more free and
just world
and the people who
Adam Smith called the masters of mankind
the people who run and own the world
they don't like that to go back to my
earlier comments that's why liberal
intellectuals in the early 1970s
were criticizing the ins I'm quoting
again
criticizing the institutions responsible
for the indoctrination of the young for
failure to carry out these activities
properly
okay
that's the constant struggle it's a kind
of form of class struggle within the
framework of the institution of the
educational institutions
thank you so much for that answer and um
for giving your time again uh for this
dialogue I was wondering if it'd be
possible just to ask or to field uh one
or two questions
um for you to answer one or two
questions from the audience
um yeah sure thank you
um yeah so if anyone would like to just
uh come up and ask some questions uh to
Dr Chomsky about student activism or any
questions that you had like that arose
during this dialogue please feel free
and introduce yourself
hello uh Professor Dr Johnson uh thank
you for taking the time to speak with us
uh my name is
sophomore year uh my question is do you
think do you believe the Liberties and
freedom to think freely and engage in
dialogue surgery these are going to be
challenged moving forward persuade by
like the government to try to restrict
the voices of the youth
you can see it happening right now
it's not hidden
the Republican party which has shifted
far to the right is trying very hard
to restrict freedom of thought
limit the books you're allowed to read
they're cleansing libraries of books
that they think
might be subversive
may we call that Tony Morrison was
banned recently from some libraries
because of right-wing pressure
just today
I got an announcement that books
uh
uh Arch spiegelman's book Mouse other
books on the Holocaust
have been driven out of libraries
because parents are objecting the
right-wing parents very well organized
by the far right or trying to stop them
from being used uh
it's not a it's not Secret
it's all quite open
it's an effort to control thought
Trump Administration when he was still
in office
released an edict
saying that schools should not be able
to teach should not be allowed to teach
material in American history
which makes students feel uncomfortable
that disturbs students and teaching
what does that mean
not just for American history but for
the history of any country
well I don't have to bother telling you
what it means
that's straight out of stalinist Russia
straight out of stalinistration in
Hitler Germany
it's public open
it's right in Notre Dame and other
places it's coming out of the
right of the mainstream Republican party
it's mainstream America you can see
these things right in front of your eyes
they're not hidden they're presented
quite proudly
and they're presented as defense of
what's right just they're not
it's presented as the proper thing to do
with these elements gain more
important power in the country you think
you're going to see more of it
something to struggle against not to
permit
foreign
I'm Isaac I'm a sophomore and I had a
question about the United States role
it's a common question but kind of
threaded the needle between being
um like having this moral responsibility
to the rest of the world because of our
wealth but also not
kind of repeating the mistakes of like
the Reagan Administration
um I think he once said like the only
Justified Wars World War II so like
what's like your criteria for moral
intervention in other countries
well it depends what you mean by moral
intervention
if moral intervention means
censuring
uh
um
the Muhammad bin Salman MBS for his
involvement in the murder of the
journalist khashoggi
that's fine if it means condemning
crimes of others joining with Human
Rights Watch and fantasy International
that would be fine I'd like to see it
happen
not just against
enemies and antagonists but against Iran
allies are on Country there's plenty to
talk about here so that's moral
intervention
if you mean some other kind of
intervention
intervention that involves any kind of
force it raises very serious questions
and here's something I think you ought
to look into
in carrying out inquiry there is a
category called a concept called
humanitarian Interventional
really developed mostly in the
1990s most of which not by accident
after the fall of the Soviet Union as
long as the Soviet Union was around
there was an easy justification for any
kind of intervention any kind of
atrocity crime
aggression violence torture always had a
justification the Communists are coming
the Russians are coming so you didn't
need any orchids collapse of the Soviet
Union
was harder to appeal to that and still
try but doesn't have the appeal that it
had before
so something new was needed so all of a
sudden
humanitarian intervention came along
okay we're still going to intervene but
it's going to be for humanitarian ends
now
well
actually there is an interesting history
of humanitarian intervention and that's
what I urge you to look into
ask yourself a simple question
has it ever happened
has there ever been
a case of authentic humanitarian
intervention
that is the use of force undertaken to
prevent crimes and atrocities
actually there's scholarship on the
topic in the legal scholarship
what you'll find is it's almost
impossible to find an example
almost every use of force by everyone
is declared to be humanitarian that goes
back as far as you go
so when Hitler
took over the heart of Czechoslovakia
and Sudan land
it was
out of the goodness of his heart
to prevent ethnic conflict to bring to
the people of Czechoslovakia the
benefits of superior German civilization
when Japan in the 1930s was carrying out
horrendous atrocities in Manchuria and
China the rape of 19 other grotesque
atrocities and take a look at the
Japanese literature I've written about
it I wrote about it in the 1960s if you
want to look
was overflowing with human kindness we
want to create an Earthly Paradise in
China
unfortunately we have to protect the
Chinese people from Chinese Bandits
terrorists
uh namely the people who are resisting
Japanese aggression but it was just and
these incidentally are internal
documents not for the public these are
their own counter-insurgency documents
they're talking to each other
believed it if we had documents from
Attila the Hun we'd probably find the
same thing
we find the same thing I won't talk
about it now and among the leading
British intellectuals the most
outstanding of the people at John
Stewart Mill writing them giving
talking about the magnificence of
England as it carries out
in horrendous atrocities you'll find
plenty of it here I've given plenty of
examples
so she didn't find an actual case of
humanitarian intervention
that's very Illuminating
let's take the period since
the Second World War
actually there are two cases that come
to mind
you won't read about them because
they're the wrong kind of cases
that's not what's given to you
inapproperly under proper indoctrination
but think about them
one case was in 1978.
Vietnam invaded Cambodia
it drove out the Camaro Rouge it ended
their genocidal atrocities drove them
out
I wouldn't call it a humanitarian
intervention because that was not their
purpose
their purpose was to defend Vietnam from
attacks border attacks by the Khmer
Rouge but the effect was to end the
atrocities of Cambodia
how did the United States react
by bitterly condemning Vietnam imposing
sanctions on them
supporting the Khmer Rouge determining
that there are the legitimate government
of Cambodia is supporting them in the
United Nations
supporting a Chinese Invasion to punish
Vietnam for ending the rule of the Khmer
Rouge that's one example
a couple years later
uh
there was the in Pakistan
Pakistani army
attacked with snow Bangladesh which is
then East Pakistan again carrying out
monstrous atrocities
India intervened uh stopped the
atrocities
gave East Pakistan the chance for
Independence and snow Bangladesh how did
the U.S react same way
bitter attacks against India sanctions
Henry Kissinger was in charge and sent
the American Fleet to the Bingo to
threaten the in Indians for doing this
green reason is it's spoiled
a photo op he was planning to set up by
a trip to China which went through
Pakistan well those are the two main
examples of humanitarian intervention in
recent history you're not going to read
about them unless you're taking a very
unusual course one that's concerned with
the facts not with indoctrination
there are cases that in our here are
called humanitarian intervention
like the U.S invasion of
Serbia
Kosovo in 1999.
claim is that this was done to prevent
Serbian atrocities
probably what you read total lie
it's very well documented
there were Observer European observers
on the ground we know exactly what
happened
the atrocities were caused by the
intervention
furthermore that was conscious
the Clinton Administration was directly
informed
by the top General Wesley Clark NATO
General that if the United States bombed
it would lead to Major atrocities
went ahead and did it for their own
reasons comes down in history as a
humanitarian intervention to prevent
atrocities
well that's effective indoctrination
the institution is responsible for the
indoctrination of the young
and and the general population are doing
their job
you're in a position where you can
freely
inquire and investigate these things not
just accept what you're told
okay do it
I'm sure you can find the documentation
right in the Notre Dame Library
same in general so going back to your
question
when is intervention proper
when it is undertaken
to have a beneficial effect and how does
that effect
you'll be very hard pressed to find
authentic examples that's not the way
Power Systems operate
there are occasional exceptions but
they're pretty rare and remember every
use of force isn't Justified that way
whether it's Japanese fascists Nazis
anybody else
but you have to tear through the
propaganda and see what's happening
freedom
gonna have to leave him
all right well thank you so much Dr
Chomsky for again spending on uh this
time with us and answering our questions
I think your presence here is a
testament to the fact that how of how
seriously you've taken um up the
responsibility of the intellectual
um and yeah I just really thank you
again for your for your time here thanks
today
thank you
