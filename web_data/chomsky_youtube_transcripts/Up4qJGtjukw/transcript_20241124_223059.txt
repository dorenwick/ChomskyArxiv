Hello everyone, my name is Jenny Li
And it is my honor today to speak with
To speak with Professor Noam Chomsky
Concerning his essay
"The Responsibility of Intellectuals"
And his book Who Rules the World
In the context of Taiwan and Asian affairs
Good afternoon, Professor Chomsky
Thank you so much for taking the time
To speak with us today
Very pleased to be with you
So I wanted to start off with a question
That relates to both
"The Responsibility of Intellectuals"
And Who Rules the World
So this is my first question
The United States has always had more power
And influence over world affairs
Than, say, Taiwan and smaller countries in Asia
By extension, one can imagine that
The American intellectual
When in successful in influencing their government
Will have more influence 
over international affairs
Than intellectuals from this part of the world
Do you think American intellectuals
Have more responsibility than
Say, for example, Taiwanese intellectuals
Well, responsibility is basically
A function of opportunity
The more opportunity you have
The greater responsibility
So, somebody like me
Has more responsibility
Than, say, a homeless person
Begging on the street
They don't have the opportunities
That I have
And, by extension
If you're in the richest
And most powerful country
In world history
And it's a moderately democratic country
And so what you do matters
Then you have greater responsibility
You've also said that
The prime concern for intellectuals
Are the crimes for which they share responsibility
And that they can do something about
You wrote "The Responsibility of Intellectuals"
In the context of the US war in Vietnam
In the 1960s
Do you think there are any lessons
For intellectuals today
In what you've learned since?
Very definitely
We have far greater challenges today
Far greater
Than we had
Even in opposition to the Vietnam War
We have greater responsibilities
Than has ever arisen in human history
We cannot overlook the fact
That your generation is
Facing a decision
That has never arisen before
Will human life
On earth persist
In any organized form?
We are now
Busily destroying the planet
If we don't change course
Significantly
Nothing else is going to matter
I'm referring to the
Destruction of the environment
Global warming
Habitat destruction
Destruction of the ocean
All proceeding
Very rapidly
As perhaps you saw
Yesterday
There was
A report that came out
Originally from the AFP
The French news agency
That circulated worldwide
It was a draft
They had somehow gotten ahold
Of the draft report
Of the IPCC
International monitors
Of the environment
Scientists who
The main scientific organization
That produces
The scientific consensus
On the state of the environment
And it's much more dire
Than the past ones
The past ones have been serious enough
This one is much more serious
We have to move quickly
To end the use of fossil fuels
To move to sustainable energy
To end habitat destruction
Or else
Human life in any meaningful form
Will cease to exist
Well, what's our responsibility?
To ensure that this happens
I'd rather not say it
As an American intellectual
In the United States right now
Well, the United States
Per capita emissions
Is way at the top
Of developed society
China actually
Has greater total emissions
But far lower per capita
And, of course, in the past
Emissions have been
Overwhelmingly rich countries
And to be more precise
Rich people within the rich countries
They're the ones responsible for this
And responsible for doing something about it
Well, there are things to do
There are in the United States Congress
There is pending legislation
On a very effective form
Of a Green New Deal
Pretty much what is recommended
By the International Energy Association
Programs which would, in fact
Put a limit on the threat
Mitigate the crisis
Lead us to creating
A much better world
With a sustainable environment
And a much better life
For all of us
Within reach
It can be done
Within a few percentage
Of the Gross Domestic Product
Far less than was used
Say, during the World War
Actually even less than was expended
Than the Treasury Department
Than to bail out the financial institutions
During the COVID epidemic
It's all within reach
But it has to be done
And it's not going to be done
Unless major efforts are
Made by people with the opportunity
To convince others
To engage in these commitments
It's a tremendous opportunity
And a tremendous responsibility
Thank you so much for your response
To that question, Professor Chomsky
And again related to your essay
The Responsibility of Intellectuals
In the beginning of that essay
You referenced Dwight MacDonald
Who questioned the extent
To which the German or Japanese people
Were responsible for the atrocities
Committed by their governments
Today, the US-Taiwan-China relation
Is strained
And dialogue between any two governments
Is difficult
But one can imagine
That dialogues between people
Are bound by fewer constraints
To what extent do you think
Are regular people
Those we don't normally think of as intellectuals
Responsible for preventing
Conflict between their countries
I should first comment
On briefly
On the responsibility
Of the Japanese
And the Germans
For their atrocities
They were defeated in the war
And defeated countries are
Forced to acknowledge
Some of their atrocities
In the case of the Japanese
It was very striking
The trials of the Japanese
Were run by the United States
And they made a very careful distinction
Among Japanese atrocities
They began with Pearl Harbor
They did not discuss
The atrocities of the Japanese
Against Asians
Which were enormous
And extraordinary
By far the worst ones
They were cut out
At the tribunal
The reason incidentally
Was that Asian countries
Almost all of them
Refused to attend the San Francisco Peace Treaty
Because of the narrow way
In which the United States
Construed Japanese crimes
One of the reasons
They simply refused to attend
So there was partial
Acknowledgement of responsibilities
In the case of Germany
More extensive
The United States and Britain
Didn't acknowledge their atrocities
During the Second World War
Which were very significant
The bombing of Japan
For example, was a major atrocity
The bombing of urban environments in Germany
A major atrocity
These are unacknowledged
In fact, the trials
Were set up
The Nuremberg Trials
The most significant and serious ones
Was set up in such a way
As to absolve
To absolve the Allies of any responsibility
But German war criminals
Could plead in defense
That the Allies had done the same thing
And that was recognized
To be a defense
Because the crimes of the Allies
The victors
Could not be considered
That was even more dramatically true
Than the Tokyo trials
Which were victors' justice
So partial acknowledgement
Well, coming to your question
We have an enormous responsibility today
To prevent the kinds of conflicts
That are coming
That are brewing
Thart are developing
And if permitted
The current course is pursued
It will very likely
Lead to extremely dangerous situations
Possibly even nuclear war
And a nuclear war
Between major powers
Is simply unthinkable
It would essentially destroy everything
It would leave the kind of world
Nobody would want to live in
Well, how is it happening?
Just take a look
At what's happening right off the coast of China
Well, Chinese warplanes
Have penetrated the air defense
Systems of Taiwan
The United States has sent
A huge naval armada
Two major aircraft carrier groups
Into the South China Sea
An area of enormous strategic importance for China
Any of these things could blow up
At any moment
Off the coast of China
It's not in the Caribbean Sea
It's not
The Eastern Pacific region
The Eastern Pacific off the coast of California
It's off the ocast of China
China is ringed with nuclear bases
A circle of containment
Nuclear missiles aimed
At China from US bases
All through the Pacific
What's called the Quad
The four major Asian US allies
Japan
The US, Japan
Australia, India
All in the hands of
Extremely right-wing, hawkish governments
They are now being
Organized by the United States
To take a more active
Hostile view toward China
The United States itself
Is devoting enormous efforts
To try to prevent China's development
It's pretty shocking to look at it
We should be cooperating
It is necessary
For China and the United States
Two major economies
Should be cooperating
On all sorts of issues
Crucial issues
Like global warming
Pandemics
Nuclear weapons
Instead of cooperating on these
There's conflict
Most of it initiated by the United States
Just to give an example of the extent
To which it reaches
The United States Congress just passed
A limited stimulus bill
To reconstruct collapsing infrastructure
Which badly needs repair
In the United States
US infrastructure is a scandal
You can take a high-speed train
From Beijing to Kazakhstan
But you can't take it from Boston to Washington
New York to Washington
The most heavily traveled corridor
Because the United States is so backward
In infrastructure
Well, a limited bill was finally passed
It couldn't be an adequate bill
Because the Republican party 
blocked anything adequate
But it did pass
And the only way to pass it
Was to put it into a "Hate China" framework
We have to rebuild our infrastructure
To make sure that China doesn't get ahead of us
It's outrageous
After we build our infrastructure
Because we need to rebuild it
If China happens to make contributions
In solar power
In electrification
In health areas, whatever
We should be congratulating them
And joining with them
Not planning to impede it
This goes far back in American history
Back to the 18th and 19th centuries
During the 19th century
When the imperial powers
Led by Britain
Were attacking China
Forcing China
It was the largest narco-trafficking operation
In world history
To try to undermine China
The United States was participating in it
During that period
Chinese workers were being kidnapped
To work in the United States
On work Americans didn't want to do
Like blasting through the mountain
For the Transcontinental Railroad
Chinese coolies they were called
Bitterly repressed
In 1882
The United States passed its first law
Against immigrants
Aimed at the Chinese
No Chinese could immigrate
And the Chinese who were in the United States
Were forcefully and rather brutally evicted
That remained
That law remained till quite recently
During the 1950s
There was another anti-China hysteria
That developed
In fact
Some of this was so extreme
That Jack London
One of the most progressive writers
About a century ago
Wrote a story
About how we have to
Kill everyone in China
By bacteriological warfare
To prevent them from conquering and destroying us
Well, comes up to today
When there's another "Hate 
China" campaign developing
China does a lot of wrong things
They should be criticized and condemned
Just as they should condemning
Our wrong things done by the United States
But this is no reason
To build up a monstrous
"Hate China" campaign
Which will undermine
Which is not only harming China
As it intended to
But it's harming everyone
Cause it's building up the kinds of
Tensions that could seriously explode
And it's preventing the kind of cooperation
International cooperation
That is necessary
If we're going to deal with our current crisis
Thank you so much
So my next question is related
To this so-called competition
Between the United States and China
In an interview last August
With the Foreign Correspondent's Club of Hong Kong
You described China's actions in Asia
An attempt to reasser its traditional role
As a regional power
And how the United States will not allow it
You also described Hong Kong
As the trampled grass
When elephants fight
So my question is this
How should people in Taiwan
And smaller countries in Asia
Navigate this Great Power conflict
Between the United States and CHina
And do you see any room
For agency or self-determination
For the grass?
It's a very tough situation for them
Hong Kong has been subjected to
Highly repressive
Chinese actions
The last couple of years
Which would be
Resisted to the extent possible
They should be partially condemned
In the case of Taiwan
Taiwan has developed
A very impressive functioning democracy
A very impressive economy
In fact, it has the leading semiconductor plant
In the world
Just one example
There is a delicate situation
With China
It has been maintained so far
By formally accepting
The One China Policy
But in fact implementing
Separate and independent
Political and economic development
Well, as for the Taiwanese
The increasing hostilities
Between the US and China
Are a very severe threat
And they should be doing whatever they can
To pressure
The major powers
Towards diplomacy
And negotiations
And cutback of hostile actions
They can help in this regard
Same in Hong Kong
Hong Kong of course
Had a fair degree of independence
But we should bear in mind that
That's recent
Hong Kong was stolen from China
By British savagery
As part of their effort to destroy China
In their huge narco-trafficking operations
The West may like to forget that
But I'm sure the Chinese don't
That's part of the background
To remember
It doesn't justify
What Chinese authorities are doing now
But it can help explain it
So yes
The countries in the periphery of China
Have a degree of agency
A very difficult situation
Hard to maneuver
But their efforts should be dedicated
To the extent possible
To pressing the great powers
The United States and China
US allies in Asia
Towards negotiation and diplomacy
Which is certainly possible
There's plenty of room for it
The problems that exist are real
They can be mitigated
Settled by proper peaceful means
And that's the only hope for decent survival
For the countries of Asia
Or, for that matter, the world
This is my last question 
for you, Professor Chomsky
You've spent lots of time 
in this part of the world
In Asia
Do youth movements in Asia today give you hope?
And is there anything you would like to say
To future generations?
Well, Asia's in a remarkable situation
If you look back at world history
Going back millenia
Up until the 18th century
That's almost all of recorded history
Asia was the center of global civilization
Europe was a fringe of barbarians
The outside of Asia
You remember very well, I'm sure
That when the British emissaries
Came to China
In the 18th century
And were admitted
By the emperor
Allowed to visit him
To try and arrange for trade agreements
He, the emperor, informed them
We don't need anything from you
We have everything we need
We're far more advanced than you are
If you want
We'll let you set up a 
small trading post somewhere
Where you can follow our rules
But you have nothing to offer us
That was pretty much the case
Same is true of India
India was a rich developed society
Far more so than England
The Europeans had one advantage
Savagery
That's it
The Europeans were more advanced
In the means of warfare
Military historians point out
That Europe had turned war into a science
None of the rest of the world had
And using their
Advantages in savagery
The Europeans were able to
Break into Asia
Devastate India
Deindustrialize India
England stole it's higher technology
Deindustrialized and wrecked it
Break into China
Through mainly violence
They had greater means of violence
The narco-trafficking operations
And Asia suffered a period in human history
A brief period of subjection
To outside forces
It was very harmful
Well, it's beginning its recovery
It's recovering the status
That it once had
It's becoming again
A major center of civilization
Of production
Of culture and so on
Where's it going to go from here?
That's in your hands
There's a lot of possibilities
But Asia could recover
The kind of position it once had
Not that it was a beautiful society
It wasn't in many ways
But in comparison with
Global conditions at the time
It was the most advanced
And it can move in that direction again
But that depends on
How people in Asia
People like you
Young people
Will be able to take advantage
Of the opportunities
That are available to you
And overcome
The very severe obstacles
That lie in the way of doing so
It's a historic challenge
So thank you so much for 
your time, Professor Chomsky
And for everything that you've done
It was my pleasure speaking with you today
Thank you very much
Thank you
