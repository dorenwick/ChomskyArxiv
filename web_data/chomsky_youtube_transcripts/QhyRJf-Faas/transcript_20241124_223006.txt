hi welcome to the analysis.news i'm paul
jay
in just a few seconds i'll return
with my guests noam chomsky and daniel
ellsberg we're going to talk about the
significance or legacy of the life of
gorbachev
on tuesday august 30th
mikhail gorbachev
died
and his legacy is a matter of
of course international discussion
debate
apparently putin is not going to his
funeral which i believe is taking place
maybe as we speak
he wrote some kind of note about it
but gorbachev has been praised in the
west as a hero of the deconstruction of
the soviet union
and also condemned and and much talk
about his failings now to talk about the
significance or of gorbachev's life and
the demise of the soviet union uh
joining me again is noam chomsky and
daniel ellsberg thank you very much for
joining me again gentlemen thank you
thank you
noah why don't you nom kick us off uh
you know how do you assess the the the
end of the soviet union and the role of
governor gorbachev
well gorbachev
was not
committed to the end of the soviet union
that's
a misstatement he it's
commonly said but that was not his goal
he did open up russia
and he opened up the region
to
a degree of
freedom that they had not enjoyed
his own intention
was not to break up the soviet union but
he had a very much broader vision and i
think that's his
major contribution
among many
he called for
what he called a
common european home
from
lisbon to vladivostok
with no
military alliances
no victors no defeated
co-equals
working together
towards
basically a social democratic future
transformation in
of the whole region
working without military alliances with
cooperation
this was an expansion of the goalless
division
of an independent
europe as a
third force in international affairs
gorbachev carried it forward
um could have survived
president bush was not
strongly opposed to it uh clinton
dismantled it
when he moved right away to
expand nato
to the russian border
in violation of
firm promises to gorbachev
but the ideal
of a common european home
no military alliances
working together to achieve a
social democratic future
that's a vision we should
honor respect and try to achieve
i saw gorbachev
when he was in power
as the single
head of state we'd ever seen and really
the last one we've seen i'd say who was
wholly committed fundamentally committed
to a non-nuclear world to getting rid of
nuclear weapons and beyond that
through a world with a different world
order that was not based on threats and
unilateral uh sovereign
efforts to
assure the security of one nation
at the expense of another
but he pressed uh an id a revolutionary
idea really
uh that had some adherence in which he
got from uh from some others of common
security sometimes called cooperative
security collective security the idea
was uh first proposed in some detail by
olaf palmy in the palmy commission in
1982 before gorbachev came to power but
gorbachev picked that up in and and from
european
uh
at a nuclear and anti-war activists like
horst ahfield and uh in the u.s from
randy forsberg and others who spoke of
the need to take into account the
security of others as well as one's own
security and let's try to avoid an
action reaction cycle in which efforts
to maintain one's own security by
threatening the other by lessening the
security of adversaries revivals
and rather than having adversaries and
rivals work together to achieve security
that would be best for both sides in
particular horseshoe fault and the
others and randy ortberg pressed
for
non-offensive defense
um
weapons of
protection which could not be used in
offense you had to sort of eliminate the
offensive threat to the others uh let me
give an example that is relevant right
now for example
uh
oddly or in an
unprecedented kind of relationship we
have to taiwan
uh in theory we agree with china
beijing
taiwan is part of china among china on
the other hand thanks to pressure from
congress since 1979 we continue to arm
this province of china taiwan against a
possible use of force against it now if
if if she or his predecessors were like
gorbachev
they would not be threatening force to
reunite with his province uh actually
the way the as as paul has said
it was not gorbachev's intention to
dismantle the soviet union
but he definitely refused to use force
to maintain it
in east germany and other places in
poland and it spread very quickly in in
89 beyond what he'd expected i think he
thought there would be more willingness
to remain in without the use of force
but in any case she refused to use it
okay so
uh nevertheless she and the others have
always maintained that if peaceful means
did not
uh were not sufficient to reunite
eventually with taiwan uh and the
mainland that forest was not excluded
and they have built up force to that
effect for the last 20 years now for the
last 40 years we have limited our sales
of arms to taiwan to so-called defensive
means and we've seen those means at work
in ukraine actually
stingers you know anti-tank
anti-aircraft
weapons that do not pose a threat
beyond their borders and actually
very effectively more than almost anyone
expected in ukraine
they have worked against the invasion by
tanks and other offensive forces in
ukraine resulting so far in a stalemate
so not a wonderful situation well in
taiwan
i believe the effort to move toward
recognizing
taiwan overthrowing the 1979 agreements
uh i really don't know internally why
they're out in the world uh motivates
those but i think one thing
is to sell still arms to taiwan to
greatly increase above the levels of the
past the sales of arms by our leading
arms manufacturers
raytheon northrop grumman general
dynamics bowling blocking
and
there has been talk even recently let's
add to their defense by giving them a
deterrent capability against the
mainland and that would mean longer
range weapons missiles that could reach
the mainland which as far as i know they
don't have now they did have when it was
a u.s base before 1979.
so the idea of making it a base which
would again
threaten the mainland for deterrent
purposes
is
clearly crossing a red line that would
almost really lead to war
so there is a difference between these
airmen coming right back to ukraine as a
matter of fact what is the major
rationale
that uh putin has given
for uh forceful means
to uh prevent ukraine from uniting with
the west not only in the european union
but in nato and the answer that he gives
is there could be nato basins which
there aren't there now which would have
long-range cruise missiles right on the
border of russia now whether russia
could really withstand that or not what
we can predict
is the old cycle
hundreds of years thousands of years in
effect the one one part one one region
gains an offensive threat against the
other the other reacts in various ways
by building up its own arms
or in this case by invading
by this and uh that threat of putting
actual weapons now right now we've even
given
uh long-range
rocket means to ukraine with a proviso
they must not use it against russia
taking the risk that some will someone
will go beyond those great mounds and go
into russia but the distinction
is very clear there
so what gorbachev accepted was the idea
this idea of non-offensive defense of
removing a threat
in order to regain to increase the
security of both sides together and he
actually acted on that
by the way i'm very
i i remember this so clearly with the
the death of gorbachev in the fact that
no one that i've seen in the obituaries
has mentioned what gorbachev
what he called a new way of thinking
from palming and forsberg and the others
and people in his own uh group like
georgie arbitoff and others at the
institution study usa a new way of
thinking included
this notion of removing rats from your
adversary well on december 7
1988 uh three years into his uh becoming
head of the soviet union he gave a
speech the u.n totally unforeseen by the
us i would say
in which and of course he talked about
this common security and the need need
to work on common interests in pursuit
by the way of what gnome has pointed to
a common home
uh european home
and to make it rather than you know a
rival adversary confronting each other
he then said unilaterally
he was removing 5 000 tanks
from east germany
which by the way had was surrounded
berlin and kept you know west berlin
uh under threat during that whole time
so he's removing 5 000 tanks
50 000 troops
from east germany
ultimately he took out half a million
and half a million unilaterally before
any other agreement from the armed
forces he was reducing
and as a colonel in the pentagon was
quoted in the new york times the day
after the day after december 7th
he said this is worse than pearl harbor
whether jock italy or not but they meant
that as georgie arbital said at the time
we are doing something terrible to you
we are removing your enemy
we're taking away your enemy
and that led you know that preceded the
uh the general reduction of of force in
each country that led to the uprisings
well i think what we've seen since then
and right up to the present
is that this otherwise
un inexplicable
refusal of
the us and nato
in the 90s
and later
in this century
to try to enhance our friendly relation
with russia which was for a time not
continents not communist and was
capitalist uh friendly hoping for
investment in whatever
to do what gorbachev was offering a
friendly relationship he said not an
adversary friendly relationship
i think what that and that's what george
kennan one of the creators of the cold
war said at the time
that expanding nato
was a disaster precisely because it
would undermine
those elements like gorbachev in russia
and after gorbachev
for an open democratic friendly
relationship with europe
in favor of reactionary and militaristic
and cannon said as early as 1990s
ultimately you'll go to ukraine and that
will seal it you know that will make you
make impossible any friendly
relationship
uh with with russia in this european
home
well we acted totally contrary to that
as as early as 2008 george w bush
against france and germany's strong
objection
said
georgia and ukraine both parts of the
u.s itself
will be part of nato and we've gone
along those lines why are we doing that
let me give
my guess at this point
that the
ruling establishment in this country and
the military industrial complex the
atlanticist uh forces of nato which was
our foot called in europe economically
and militarily
never wanted a friendly relation with
russia uh to persist but to be a
non-enemy
where would nato be under those
circumstances gorbachev and even nelson
and even putin at one point said well
maybe russia could be in nato and for a
while there was a partnership
relationship
but why do you need nato they have
russians in it why do you need all these
weapons that the corporations i've just
described and french and other
corporations
are selling to nato against who
uh if russia is a friend uh you don't
you don't need any of this so the
profits go but even more importantly the
u.s
hegemonic leadership role in europe
banishes if you don't have a russian
enemy
so contrary to gorbachev in other words
a russian enemy was indispensable to our
imperial
elements here who wanted
a
dominant u.s position in nato and
elsewhere and this concept of his pretty
much vanished
uh with him you just don't read about it
my friend tom reifer our friend gnome
uh sent me today at my request a number
of articles on this subject
uh which i've been looking at which is
absolutely fascinating by randy forsberg
john steinbrunner
um
miller who had innovated these concepts
are very brilliant
in the early even in the early 2000s
but
they've gone down the memory hall
essentially and i think that
some u.s elements here have been
successful
getting putin to reconstitute russia as
a clear-cut enemy to be
on as long as you can foresee now
enormous
profitable benefit to the military
industrial complex but in particular to
the u.s role in europe for example
getting rid of the nordstrom tool gas
gas line from russia which he was
opposed for decades now for more than a
decade
so
the loss of gorbachev not by death but
much earlier
the power
um
i think was was the loss of these
concepts to the world
i don't say irretrievable but
irretrievably but i think definitely
lessened the odds
for human survival
nom you want to pick up from there
there are a number of points that dan
made that i think ought to be stressed
the main one
that comes out of what he's saying is
that
the great powers
united states
russia china
must
come to some kind of accommodation
or else there's no hope for survival of
the human species
uh notice i don't mention europe
and that's interesting
europe ought to be on a par
with
certainly china and
the united states at least economically
russia doesn't even belong in that
in that club
their economies about the size of mexico
europe
has
failed
in the last 70 years to find a place in
the world order
it's got a
huge economy
educated population culturally advanced
every reason why it should play a major
role in world affairs
well there has been
a conflict
one was
the gallerist vision as
dan pointed out olaf palma
supported
billy brunt in germany with his us
politics supported it
the idea that
there should be a
third force
in which
western europe and russia would join
together
without military alliances
that was confronted with the
atlanticist division as it was called
based on nato
with the u.s in charge
well given us power that of course won
when gorbachev came along
it raised a new crucial issue
there was no you could no longer rely on
the pretext that we have to defend
ourselves against the
russian hordes
actually was always a pretext as
kennen and others understood will
but you couldn't even claim it anymore
by
the time that gorbachev came along
so what was going to happen to europe
well there's gorbachev's
conception of a
common european home no military bases
co-equals partnership
move towards general accommodation which
would then
naturally extend to the china-based
region
the road initiative came later and so on
and so forth that's one
the other was the atlanticist vision
nato-based
u.s in charge
nato expanding to the russian border
the uh
when george bush ii not the first
it
invited ukraine
into
nato
i don't know if he understood what he
was doing but the people around him
certainly did
uh robert gates his hawkish defense
secretary said this is reckless
provocative crazy
if
russia if ukraine was to go into nato
any russian leader would probably go to
war
that's the hawkish secretary of defense
it was understood all along the line
bush went ahead
france and germany as
then
pointed out vetoed it but
u.s powers
strong enough to overcome that so it
stays on the agenda
since then
the us has been building up
uh ukraine as an offensive
a partner if it was integrated into nato
in fact u.s military journals call it a
de facto member of nato
the u.s has announced clearly
it would not consider any russian
security concerns
uh we go on
to the situation where we are now
where the
atlanta where nato has
changed
the global geography
by now
native the north atlantic includes the
indo-pacific region
the last nato summit for the first time
invited
u.s asian allies
and explained that the realm of nato
includes now the indo-pacific region
surrounding china
uh
conflict with russia
this is a
recipe for disaster
the world can't go on like then
we will have to quickly
find a way
to bring
first of all for europe to play
the role it should in your world affairs
not hanging on to u.s coattails
uh
the amano and macron is about the only
statesman visible in the world right now
who's
continuing his
efforts so far in vain to work towards
some sort of
way of ending the horrors in ukraine
through a diplomatic settlement and
moving on towards better relations that
has to be done
if that isn't done
we have no vote
it's not only
ukraine
they decide the
kind of
collateral damage as it's called is
immense
it means
millions of people are facing starvation
with the uh
closing off of the
black sea
food and fertilizer the region
uh they heard the
limited efforts to deal with the
enormous crisis of
global warming have been reversed
we don't have much time
to spend the few years that we have
instead of dealing with this crisis to
exacerbating it
is
beyond lunacy
there is a severe and growing threat of
nuclear war
uh it goes way beyond ukraine
answer we have to find
ways to move towards gorbachev's vision
to cooperate
work together to overcome
problems that have no borders there are
global problems nuclear war has no
borders
uh
climate change of course has none
threats of growing pandemics have done
we cannot waste time
destroying each other
just
producing
destructive weapons and
carrying out mass slaughter where we
must be working
towards them quickly towards
accommodation
diplomatic settlement
best of all move towards the
vision that gorbachev sketched
all right well thank you both very much
we're going to i'm going to continue my
conversation with noam and dan we're
