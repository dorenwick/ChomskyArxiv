i'm here with professor noam chanske
historian political activist
uh
considered to be the founder of modern
linguistics and one of the most
influential public intellectuals in the
world
professor chamskay
thank you for your time
very glad to be with you
mr champs
it was only a several months ago that
you predicted
um that the u.s withdrawal from
afghanistan
would cause the collapse
of the afghan army
and the government
and
that's exactly what's happened that's
what's unfolding in the last
few weeks as we've seen
and yet we see the biden administrations
and others
express surprise
at what's happened
or at least at the speed at which it's
all happened
where are your thoughts on that the
basic problem is one
that is familiar
in other circumstances
vietnam
iraq
the executive branch of the government
the top
of the government is burdened
by intelligence information
which is rarely accurate
the people on the ground know what's
happening
but as the information
filters up to the top
it gets
modified adapted
to what people want to hear
and they literally don't know what's
happening
we saw that over and over again
if you were not burdened by intelligence
and you were just looking at the
fact
it was pretty plain what was going to
happen
i don't say that in retrospect you can
look back at things i was writing months
ago
the government
was
a morass of corruption
which had virtually no support
the army was
largely on paper
about half of it probably wasn't even
there ghost soldiers
others were
trained
on the american military model
where you rely on
very heavy
uh
air power
mechanized support
to try to keep
soldiers from really entering directly
into combat
they're not going to win the guerrilla
war that way go back to vietnam
take the tet offensive
in january
1968
the most astonishing uprising
that's ever
happened in military history
the u.s had
almost 600 000 troops in south vietnam
there was a south vietnamese army of
700 000
very well armed
trained by the u.s they were they were
in every village
nobody had one word
about the fact that a huge popular
uprising took place all over the country
completely surprising everyone
the u.s had to turn to
massive
bombardment to try to put it down
a couple of weeks before that
the generals were telling washington
uh we've won the war it's all over you
know we can start pulling out troops
okay
we know the mechanisms by which that
happens
same happens when
i took iraq
the iraqi army
that the u.s had created
had about
350 000
well
armed
soldiers according to the statistics
800 jihadis
800
coming in pickup trucks waving rifles
they disappeared
okay
it's uh
you know these are
it's happens over and over and you never
learn from it there are some small
pockets of resistance
left such as in the pan shear area where
the android area
and they have
openly publicly asked for support
they've said give us in particular
military support
would it be
wise for the us or others
to extend their hand to them
or
should
the policy be as joe biden has suggested
which is to leave afghan internal
business
and possibly civil war to afghans
whatever the policy should be
it should be determined be determined by
afghans
they are the ones who are going to
live with the situation
it's their responsibility
they should be brought actively
into the
uh
arrangements they are the ones who have
to be in the lead in determining policy
that never crossed anyone's mind
i mean
it wasn't even
an option to be considered
the only option is how do we do this in
the best way for us you know okay that's
going to be a disaster
uh the
by now it's
i mean even by now take the policy of
withholding funds from the taliban
who does that hurt the taliban
leadership
they can make get the funds from opium
sales to europe
europe buys the opium which funds the
the heroin which funds the tall amount
it'll hurt the population
just as the bombing
the drone attack yesterday hurt hurt the
population
uh if the
world bank and the imf withhold funds
same thing
uh it's gonna it's the same as sanctions
who do sanctions heard
i suppose you put sanctions on iran
devastating for the population
does it hurt the leadership
the sanctions on saddam hussein
extreme sanctions
devastated the population
the administrators
of the sanctions
distinguished
international diplomats
dennis halliday han swan sponac
they both resigned and protest
one after the other
because the sanctions they said were
genocidal
did they hurt saddam hussein
they benefited him
the population had to
shelter under his wings for survival
he had some rationing systems
it's the same over and over
the idea in powerful states is
we have force
we monopolize violence we'll use it
that's what we can do we can use our
force
what happens to the victims
not our business
that was true of the invasion of
afghanistan in the first place
20 years ago the us invaded
not knowing
who was responsible for 9 11.
the in the people
who are at the wrong end of the bombs
they often know what's happening
so right away
the most
respected of the
anti-taliban
resistance in afghanistan
abdul khak
had an interview
which he was asked to
it was of course he asked about the
invasion it was bitterly opposed he said
the invasion will just kill a lot of
afghans
it'll undermine our efforts to overthrow
the taliban from within
the united states is doing it because
they want to show their muscle
and want to intimidate everyone
it's pretty accurate
now that we are getting finally 20 years
a leaking
leakage of the
internal records from donald rumsfeld
others we see that's pretty much true
now it's conceded
that in 20 years ago the taliban offered
to surrender
and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld
said we don't negotiate surrenders
we're going to destroy you
okay
we're not going to let you live in
dignity somewhere
even though we don't know that you were
responsible for 9 11.
exactly what abdul haq said
you want to show your muscle and
intimidate everyone
okay
it's true then
it wasn't as clear then as it is now but
it was pretty clear
i was writing pretty much that at the
time as were others
but in a powerful state you don't listen
in a
well-controlled intellectual community
deeply indoctrinated following orders
you don't ask the questions
it happens over and over
and nothing is learned from it for a
good reason
not because people are stupid but that's
the way the institutions are structured
you move into those institutions
that's the way you behave
so two days ago i mean
by now the evidence is simply
overwhelming
that the american strategy
of uh
bombing villages or sending in special
forces to
break open people's doors in the middle
of the night and arrest somebody
all of this was just creating taliban
it's very well known
so what's the first reaction to the
military
when there's a terrorist attack
do the same thing
today we get the news which you could
have anticipated
family of 10 people killed seven
children
and infant
consequences
doesn't take much imagination
especially when it's been happening over
and over for 20 years so
there is a worry that with taliban
taking over the country forming a new
government um hasn't been formed yet but
that's what the prediction is
that afghanistan will become safe haven
for the likes of al qaeda
what are your thoughts on
whether on people who
say that afghanistan will become a safe
haven for these terrorists what would
that mean
for afghanistan for the region and for
the world if
that indeed well first of all
why should we assume that
afghanistan will become a haven for
terrorists
actually it's the united states
which is creating the terrorist networks
not by funding them but by its actions
what has happened let's go back to 2001.
al-qaeda
and bin laden
were
in a tiny area
at the border of the
afghan pakistan border afpak
that's where
the seat of islamic terrorism
where is it now
all over the world
we've given bin laden the greatest gift
he could have imagined
9 11 was the most successful
action
in military history
the united states reacted exactly the
way he wanted
by
showing our muscle using force
spreading
radical islam
all over the world we accelerated it
further when we invaded iraq
created
the sunni
resistance
isis finally
spreading all over africa
philippines
all over the place now let's go back to
your question
the taliban have every reason
to keep
radical islamic terrorists out of the
country
in
20 2001
they did keep
bin laden there
as part of the tribal culture
the tribal culture is yes you
give people protection
and they it's a tribal society they live
by the deep-seated tribal culture
there are specialists on
tribal societies especially afghanistan
and pakistan
people like acquire
highly respected anthropologists
has been trying for 20 years
to get somebody
to listen to this
wonderful book about it called the
throne
of the thistle
he's well respected he's in all the
major
institutes and people
i can't hear it
so the
taliban
kept
bin laden there
as
part of the tribal culture
they didn't want him around he was a
nuisance they didn't want the u.s
attacking
fact they had pretty good relations with
the us in the 1990s
they were working on pipeline
arrangements and so on but they couldn't
just kick him out
well
when the us when 9 11 happened
they did begin to make offers to allow
him to be
moved out of the country somehow maybe
sent to an islamic state for trial or
something or maybe just to totally
surrender
if the taliban leadership could live in
dignity
absolutely not
we have to show our muscle
intimidate everyone
show that we are the boss we have force
we don't negotiate surrender we're just
going to use our force to smash
everything up and make the world look
the way we want it to be
okay
imperial power trillions of dollars
spent in afghanistan
most of that went to
military but there was some money spent
in
programs that were supposed to provide
afghans with the tools
needed to build their country um
educational programs cultural programs
now we're seeing uh we've just seen over
100 000 afghans evacuated
out of the country
the u.n refugee agency just a couple of
days ago predicted that there could be
possibly
500 000 afghans leaving
afghanistan in the next few months
many of the people who are leaving the
country
are
the scholars intellectuals the young
professionals the artists
these are the very people that
were the hopes
of the country the people that were
supposed to build it
so with these people going
investment gone
um who's going to
build the country is it effectively
going back to zero to start from scratch
who's going to help taliban build it
well there are a few things to say about
that first of all chances that they'll
leave are not very high
because the europeans and the americans
are too sadistic to allow them to enter
you can see it right now okay
they may want to leave but where are
they going to go
to uzbekistan
tajikistan you know
to
denmark
to france
fat chance so what will happen now
well
the most hopeful part
is that china which has a real stake in
afghanistan
they don't want afghanistan to be a base
for islamic terrorists they'll be the
victims
western china
jin john that'll be the victims if
turkic
or other terrorist forces
have a haven in afghanistan
so it's pretty
i'd be pretty confident that they'll be
trying to
help the society
develop in some fashion they'll probably
try to bring it into the
china-based
eurasian
central asian system that they're
creating with russian support with by
now
iranian support
the whole complex system that grew out
of the
shanghai cooperation organization now
the
the belt road initiative so they'll
probably bring afghani try to bring
afghanistan into that
maybe with some
development aid
it's possible
and they'll certainly be
desperately trying to keep any terrorist
groups from forming there
us could cooperate on that
that would of course mean cooperating
with china
that's not permitted
the yellow peril is supposed to be the
big enemy
so we have to make sure not to cooperate
with china
even though
u.s china cooperation
is the basis for survival of the human
species
if china and the united states do not
cooperate
on the major issues
like environmental destruction
pandemics nuclear war
if we don't cooperate on that we're done
human species is finished it's as simple
as that
but it's not what's happening
we have to be more provocative we have
to show our muscle
new military forces move the water space
send an armada into the south china sea
show who we are you know
it's in the bones you know
it's uh
none of it's surprising
if the british were still running the
world they'd be doing the same thing
just as they did
when they were running the world
uh
it's the nature of imperial power
it's not that i mean china
does plenty of horrible things
but that's not a reason not to cooperate
any more than the fact that
the u.s does horrible things there's a
reason for china not to cooperate we
have to and afghanistan's a perfect
place
we have the same interests
making sure that
some development takes place
that these hundreds of thousands of
people
who probably can't leave
have something there that
they can
use to build and develop of some kind of
life we can help with that to some
extent
not by drone attacks
but by
development projects real ones not the
kinds you do when you occupy a country
run by the people in the country
themselves
their leadership
that'll include the taliban of course
the fact of the major force
may include what's left of the
warlord system we don't know exactly
probably they'll be arising again they
already are
in the uh
concierge valley in the north uh so
whatever works out in afghanistan
should be working with it try to help
them from outside not from on top
uh jointly with china
maybe russia russia has a major interest
there
uh afghanistan is far from the united
states but it's on the border
of the russian federation
russia has every reason
not to want radical islam
to
develop
in afghanistan and influence the states
to the north
which are within
had been within the russian sphere
every reason not to do that so there
happened to be shared interests
maybe that's enough to get
i wouldn't expect leadership elements to
do it on their own that's not their
nature
but popular forces
could
organize
internationally
solidarity to pressure their governments
to act
in a
humane insane fashion for once
it would be a break in human history but
it could happen what are some of the key
points that perhaps can be considered to
help afghanistan
become a success story to help
afghanistan or afghans go back to their
country because many
like like anyone like my husband says i
don't want to i want to be in my own
country i want to help build my country
but they don't feel that they can under
the circumstances
um
what can be done whether it's the us or
the neighbors
to help afghans first thing that can be
done
is
willingness
to
accommodate absorb
properly
the people who are able who want to flee
and are able to flee
don't close the doors to them
as europe and the united states are now
doing so first thing do is
look into the mirror see who we are
recognize that we have a responsibility
to accept the people who
are able
to escape
one second work with
jointly with others with china with
russia
with
tajikistan with
middle eastern countries to try to
help afghanistan recover in some fashion
in the way that afghans will determine
not that we will determine
we've demonstrated for centuries how we
determine things leaving the world uh
smashed up wreck
so let them do it they'll make mistakes
they'll do the wrong thing
okay we'll try to help
first simple things we can do or release
funds they need the funds for
reconstruction
then
jointly
probably mainly with china and russia
work on some kind of
support for internal development
programs
it's a shared interest
all the imperial powers have the
interest in seeing
afghanistan
recover somehow
and
not fall apart
and become a base for
the islamic state
which is just relishing everything
that's happening
they love the drone attack
after the
just what they wanted and it had exactly
the effect they wanted
okay
so we can continue
to support them as we've been supporting
al qaeda for 20 years doing exactly what
they want
or we can turn
to a different course
undermine them by supporting the
societies
where they are trying to establish roots
relying on our brutality and violence
okay it's not a deep secret it's right
in front of our eyes we've been watching
it for 20 years
thank you for your time
thank you
you
