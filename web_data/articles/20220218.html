		<h1>The Biden Administration Must Immediately Unfreeze Afghanistan’s Assets and End the Devastating Sanctions</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky with Tariq Ali, Richard Falk, Sara Roy, et al.</h2>
<h3>February 18, 2022. <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/02/18/the-biden-administration-must-immediately-unfreeze-afghanistans-assets-and-end-the-devastating-sanctions/"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>.</h3>
<p>The worst humanitarian catastrophe on earth is unfolding before our eyes. Afghanistan’s healthcare infrastructure is collapsing, poverty has drastically increased, and nearly nine million Afghans are on the brink of starvation—including one million children.</p>
<p>This man-made humanitarian catastrophe is a direct result of American policies, namely freezing Afghanistan’s foreign assets and implementing strict sanctions. Prior to the American withdrawal, nearly 80% of Afghanistan’s budget came from the international community. That money has been cut off, causing a total economic collapse and imminent mass starvation. Human rights organizations working in Afghanistan have expressed the dire need for the United States to unfreeze Afghanistan’s assets and end the sanctions in order to mitigate the enormous—and unnecessary—suffering of the Afghan people and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a failed state.</p>
<p>On February 11th, the Biden Administration announced that the United States will unfreeze seven billion dollars of Afghanistan’s currently frozen assets and reserve half of that money for legal claims brought by the families of American 9/11 victims, with the other half going to humanitarian aid. This outrageous policy all but guarantees the collapse of Afghanistan’s central bank, and an increase in instability and starvation. In response to this announcement, Afghan-American activist Bilal Askaryar stated: “The people of Afghanistan had nothing to do with 9/11; that is an undeniable fact. What Biden is proposing is not justice for 9/11 families, it is theft of public funds from an impoverished nation already on the brink of famine and starvation…”</p>
<p>If these policies continue, more Afghans will likely die in the near future than died at the hands of the Taliban and American forces over the last twenty years, combined.</p>
<p>This impending mass murder of Afghan civilians is preventable. We call on the Biden Administration to immediately end these cruel and inhumane policies by lifting the sanctions, unfreezing Afghanistan’s foreign assets, and increasing humanitarian aid. Any measure short of this will result in immense suffering and death of Afghan civilians—and it will be entirely our fault.</p>
