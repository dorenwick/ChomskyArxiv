		<h1>May Day</h1>
<h2>Noam Chomsky</h2>
<h3><em><a href="https://zcomm.org/zcommentary/may-day-by-noam-chomsky/" target="_blank">Z Commentaries</a></em>, April 29, 2012</h3>
<p>People seem to know about May Day everywhere except where it began, here in the United States of America. That&#8217;s because those in power have done everything they can to erase its real meaning. For example, Ronald Reagan designated what he called, &#8220;Law Day&#8221;-a day of jingoist fanaticism, like an extra twist of the knife in the labor movement. Today, there is a renewed awareness, energized by the Occupy movement&#8217;s organizing, around May Day, and its relevance for reform and perhaps eventual revolution.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a serious revolutionary, then you are not looking for an autocratic revolution, but a popular one which will move towards freedom and democracy. That can take place only if a mass of the population is implementing it, carrying it out, and solving problems. They&#8217;re not going to undertake that commitment, understandably, unless they have discovered for themselves that there are limits to reform.</p>
<p>A sensible revolutionary will try to push reform to the limits, for two good reasons. First, because the reforms can be valuable in themselves. People should have an eight-hour day rather than a twelve-hour day. And in general, we should want to act in accord with decent ethical values.</p>
<p>Secondly, on strategic grounds, you have to show that there are limits to reform. Perhaps sometimes the system will accommodate to needed reforms. If so, well and good. But if it won&#8217;t, then new questions arise. Perhaps that is a moment when resistance is a necessary step to overcome the barriers to justified changes. Perhaps the time has come to resort to coercive measures in defense of rights and justice, a form of self-defense. Unless the general population recognizes such measures to be a form of self-defense, they&#8217;re not going to take part in them, at least they shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If you get to a point where the existing institutions will not bend to the popular will, you have to eliminate the institutions.</p>
<p>May Day started here, but then became an international day in support of American workers who were being subjected to brutal violence and judicial punishment.</p>
<p>Today, the struggle continues to celebrate May Day not as a &#8220;law day&#8221; as defined by political leaders, but as a day whose meaning is decided by the people, a day rooted in organizing and working for a better future for the whole of society.</p>
