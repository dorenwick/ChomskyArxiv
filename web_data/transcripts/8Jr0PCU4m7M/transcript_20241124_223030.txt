thank you very much for joining us here
at the intercept for this discussion
with professor noam chomsky we're going
to be discussing today the russian
government's invasion
of ukraine the horrors that we've seen
coming out of ukraine the bloodshed
the massacres the killings
but also we are witnessing a major
assertion of power by the united states
in europe
calls for expanding u.s militarism in
europe
european governments pledging to spend
more money on weapons systems and to
increase their activities as arms
brokers
the united states at present is the
largest weapons dealer in the world
at the same time our guest noam chomsky
says that this was an act of aggression
a state-sponsored act of aggression
that belongs in the history books
alongside the 2003
us invasion of iraq as well as the 1939
invasion of poland by both the soviet
union and
nazi germany i want to welcome professor
noam chomsky to this forum here on the
intercept noam thank you very much for
being with us
pleased to be with you
i want to start because there's been a
lot of discussion uh on the left in the
united states among anti-war activists
on on how to make sense of what a just
response would look like to vladimir
putin's decision to invade ukraine and
the mass killing that we are seeing uh
we can take time to talk about the
broader historical context and you've
been discussing this
a lot in other interviews but i want to
just start by asking you is there any
aspect of the us nato and european union
response to this invasion that you
believe is just the weapons transfers to
ukraine uh the sweeping economic
sanctions and attempts to entirely
isolate not only russia and putin but
ordinary russians is there any aspect of
the government response to this by the
us nato or the european union that you
agree with
i think that uh
support for
ukraine
effort to defend itself is
legitimate
if it is of course it has to be
carefully scaled so that it actually
improves their situation and doesn't
escalate
the conflict
to lead to destruction of ukraine and
possibly beyond
sanctions against the aggressor
or appropriate just as
sanctions against washington would have
been appropriate
when it invaded iraq or afghanistan or
many other cases of course that's
unthinkable given u.s power
and in fact the first few times it has
been done the one time it has been done
the u.s simply shrugged its soldiers and
escalated
escalated the conflict
that was nicaragua
when the u.s was
brought to the world court
condemned for
unlawful use of force ordered to pay
reparations
by escalating the conflict but so it's
unthinkable in the case of the u.s but
it would be appropriate however i still
think it's not quite the right question
the right question is
what is the best thing to do
to save ukraine
from
a grim fate from further destruction
and that's to move towards a negotiated
settlement
there are some simple facts
that aren't really controversial
uh there are two ways for a war to end
one way is for one side or the other to
be basically destroyed
and the russians are not going to be
destroyed
so that means one way is for ukraine to
be destroyed
the other way is some negotiated
settlement
if there's a third way no one's ever
figured it out
so what we should be doing
is devoting all the things you mentioned
if properly
shaped
but primarily
moving towards
a possible negotiated settlement
that will save ukrainians from
further disaster
that should be the prime focus
now that requires that we don't
we can't look into
the minds of
vladimir putin and the small
clique around him we can speculate but
can't do much about it
we can however
look at the united states
and we can see that our explicit policy
explicit
is
rejection of any form of negotiations
the explicit policy was
goes way back but it was
given a
definitive form in
september 2021
in the september first
joint policy statement
that was then
reiterated and expanded in the november
10th
charter
of agreement
and if you look at what it says
basically says no
negotiations what it says is it calls
for
ukraine to move towards
what they call an enhanced
program for entering nato
which kills negotiations
uh increased sending of this is before
the invasion notice
increased
an increase in the dispatch of
advanced weapons to ukraine
more
military training
joint military exercises weapons placed
on the border
it's
we can't be sure but it's
possible that these
strong statements
may have
been a factor in
leading
putin and his circle to move from
warning to direct
invasion we don't know
but as long as that policy is guiding
the united states it's basically saying
uh
court ambassador ches freeman it's
saying
let's fight to the last ukrainian
basically what it amounts to
so the questions you raised are
important interesting just
what is the appropriate
kind of military aid to give ukrainians
defending themselves
enough to defend themselves but not to
lead to an escalation that'll just
simply lead to massive destruction
uh
and what kind of sanctions or other
actions could be effective in
deterring the aggressors
those are all important
but they pale
into insignificance in comparison with
the primary need
to move towards a negotiated settlement
which is the only alternative to
destruction
of ukraine which of course russia is
capable of carrying out
you know it's it's interesting because
uh
you know voldemort zielinski has been
uh really lionized particularly in the
u.s and western european
media and and it's almost a sort of um
he's become a kind of caricature uh with
these grand sweeping uh historical
comparisons and and often the the quotes
from him are intended to give the
appearance of this defiant leader who is
going to fight to the end
but when you read between the lines and
you read what ukrainian negotiators are
saying
when you read what zelensky
says when pressed on conditions for
peace he seems to be extremely aware of
the factors that you're citing that that
this has to end in a negotiation and i
want to ask you about the role of the us
and european media
in
uh
in sort of perpetuating uh this
mythology around zelensky
and the way in which it seems to kind of
undermine the seriousness of the
negotiators uh of ukraine or of
zielenski when he is talking in a
nuanced manner it seems that the
there's this uh intent to kind of create
a caricature rather than actually
listening to the conditions that ukraine
is stating it can live with
yes you're absolutely right
if you look at the media coverage
zelinsky's
very clear explicit
serious
statements about
what could be a political settlement
crucially
neutralization of ukraine
those have been
literally suppressed for a long period
then
sidelined in favor of uh
heroic
winston churchill impersonations
by congressmen
others and
casting zelinski in that mold
so yes of course
he's made it pretty clear that he
cares about whether ukraine survives
whether ukraine and survive
and has therefore
put forth a series of
reasonable proposals that could well be
a basis for negotiation we should bear
in mind that the
nature of a political settlement
the general nature of it has been
pretty clear on all sides
for quite some time
in fact if the u.s had been
willing to consider them there might not
have been an invasion at all
before the invasion the u.s basically
had two choices
one was
to pursue its official stance
which i just reviewed which makes
negotiations impossible and may have led
to war
the other possibility was to
pursue the options that were available
to an extent they're still somewhat
available attenuated by the
war but the basic terms are pretty clear
uh
sergey lavrov russian foreign minister
announced at the
beginning of the invasion that russia
had two main goals
two main goals
neutral neutralization of ukraine
and demilitarization
[Music]
demilitarization doesn't mean
getting rid of
all your arms it means getting rid of
a
heavy weapons
connected to
the
interaction with nato aimed at russia
what his terms meant
basically were
turn ukraine into something like mexico
so mexico is a sovereign state
can choose its own why in the world no
limitations but it can't
join a
chinese-run
military alliance
in placing
advanced weapons chinese weapons
on the u.s border carrying out
military joint military operations with
the
people's liberation army getting into
training and advanced weapons from
chinese instructors and so on
in fact that's so inconceivable that
nobody even
dares to talk about it
i mean if any
hint of anything like that happened
we know what the next step would be no
need to talk about it
so it's just inconceivable and basically
lavrov's
proposals
were saying
they could plausibly be interpreted as
saying let's turn ukraine into mexico
well that was an option that could have
been pursued
instead
the us preferred it
to do what i just described as
inconceivable for mexico now that's not
the whole story there are other issues
one issue is crimea
fact of the matter is crimea is off the
table
we may not like it
crimeans apparently do like it
but the u.s says we're never going to
concede
well
that's a basis for permanent conflict
uh zielinski has
sensibly
said
let's put that off for further
discussion
that makes sense
another issue is the non-best region
now that's been a region of
extreme violence for eight years
both sides
ukrainian shelling russian shilling
land mines all over the place lots of
violence
there are osce observers european
observers on the ground who give
regular reports you can read them
they're public
they don't try to assess the source of
the violence that's not their
mission but they talk about its radical
increase
according to them i think if i'm my
memory is correct about
15 000 people or something in that
neighborhood may have been
killed in the conflict over the last
eight years
since the maidan uprising
well something has to be done about
dunbas
the proper reaction
which maybe the russians would accept
would be a referendum an internationally
uh supervised referendum to see what the
people of the region want
uh one possibility
which was
available before the invasion
was implementation of
the minsk two
agreements which
provided for
some form of autonomy
from in the region within a broader
ukrainian federation
something like maybe switzerland or
belgium or
other places where there are federal
structures conflict but
confined within federal structures
that would have been a possibility
whether it could have worked there's
only one way to find out to try
u.s refused to try
instead
insisted on a super militant position
official position
which as far as i know the press has yet
to report
you can tell me if i'm wrong but i have
never seen
one reference anywhere in the mainstream
press so occasionally way at the margins
any reference to the official u.s
position of september 1st
2021
the reiteration and expansion of it in
november in the charter
actually i saw one reference to it in
the american conservative
conservative journal which did refer to
it
but and of course on the left people
have talked about it but
the us insisted on that position which
the alternative would have been to
pursue the opportu the option
of saying okay your main goals are
neutralization and
demilitarization meaning
mexico-style arrangement let's pursue
that
uh with regard to crimea let's accept
zolensky's
sensible position that
let's delay it we can't deal with it now
with regard to the donbass region
work towards some kind of
framework with autonomy
based on
opinions of the people who live there
which can be determined by an
internationally supervised referendum
would the russians agree
we don't know
would the united states agree
we don't know
all we know is they're rejecting it
officially
could they be pressed to accept it don't
know
we can try that's the one thing we can
hope to do
um there is a
sort of a guiding principle that we
should be keeping in mind
no matter what the issue
the most important question is
what can we do about it
not what can somebody else do about it
that's worth talking about
but from
the most
elementary
point of view
the real the major question is what can
we do about it
and we can in principle at least do a
lot about u.s policy
less about other things
so
i think that's where the focus of our
attention and energy should be
i want to ask you about uh some of the
statements that biden administration
officials have made in recent days on
the sunday talk shows this past weekend
uh you had the national security adviser
and the
secretary of state uh both laying out
what was
almost a sort of overt war plan
uh for
seeking to
uh fundamentally weaken the russian
state and and talking about the war in
ukraine as helping to achieve
uh a goal of a severely weakened russia
what we want to see is a free and
independent ukraine a weakened and
isolated russia and a stronger more
unified more determined west to what
extent are u.s actions that we're
witnessing now in ukraine ultimately
aimed at uh
bringing down the government uh in in
moscow of vladimir putin yes there was
the the kerfuffle over biden um talking
about this this guy's gotta go for god's
sake this man cannot remain power but
the actions are playing out um in in
full public view and and i think a lot
of people put too much weight on a
particular quip of joe biden though he
may have intentionally said it that way
um it's hard to tell right now with him
whether he means to say something or not
but setting that aside it does seem that
a a major aspect of the us position
right now is that this is a grand
opportunity uh to they smell the blood
of putin in the water i guess is what
i'm saying though
yes i think the actions
indicate that but remember
there's something along with action
namely in action
what is the united states not doing
well what it's not doing is rescinding
the policies
that i described
maybe the american press doesn't let
americans know about them but you can be
sure that russian intelligence reads
it's on the official white house website
obviously
so maybe americans can be kept in the
dark but the russians read it and know
about it and they know that one form of
inaction is not to change that
the other form of inaction is not to
move to participate in negotiations
now there are two countries
that could
because of their power
facilitate a diplomatic settlement
i don't say bring a belt but facilitate
make it more likely
one of them is china the other is the
united states
china is being
rightly criticized for a refusal to take
this step
the criticism of the united states is
not allowed
so the united states is not being
criticized for its
failure to take this step
and furthermore its actions which make
this step more remote
like the statements you quote on the
sunday talk shows
just imagine how
what they
how they reach uh
putin and his circle
what they're saying what they
interpreted as meaning is
nothing you can do
go ahead and destroy ukraine as much as
you like
there's nothing you can do because
you're going to be out
we're going to ensure that you have no
future so therefore you might as well go
for broke
that's what the heroic pronouncements on
the sunday talk show mean
it may
feel like you know
again winston churchill impersonations
very exciting but what they translate
into is destroy ukraine
that's the translation
in action
in refusal to withdraw
the policy positions that the russians
certainly are fully aware of even if
americans are kept in the dark
one is withdraw those
second is
do what we blame china for not doing
join in
efforts to facilitate
a diplomatic settlement
and stop telling the russians there's no
way out you might as well go for broke
your backs are against the wall
those are things that could be done
now i want to ask you about media
coverage and and first i just want to
say that that we have already seen a
horrifying number of journalists um
killed in ukraine um in fact a friend of
mine the filmmaker brent renaud was was
one of the the first journalists
uh killed in ukraine and it's um
it's it's it's horrifying to witness
media workers some of whom appear to
have been
uh directly targeted for for killing
um at the same time so i guess i just
want to say at the onset that
um i think we're seeing some incredibly
brave uh and vital journalism coming out
of ukraine um and and much of it is
being done by ukrainian
uh reporters and and and that that
statement just needs to stand on its own
um but back in the studios in washington
and berlin and london um there's a
different form of uh of of media
activism happening and uh it it really
seems as though
many journalists see their role now
uh
working for powerful particularly
broadcast media outlets as uh supporting
the position of the united states and
nato and and being actual propagandists
for a particular
uh outcome and course of action would a
strike in poland on
supplies or anything really uh
automatically be met with a military
forceful response or simply a
conversation amongst allies about how to
respond is the president showing enough
strength against putin and this is
happening uh at at the same time that
the biden administration
is now admitting that it has been
manipulating the media by putting out
unverified intelligence and pushing
claims about plans to use
chemical weapons one u.s official
telling you it doesn't even have to be
solid intelligence when we talk about it
it's more important to get out ahead of
them putin specifically before they do
something it's preventative now this
kind of activity from the us government
is is
not new
what i think is is extraordinary or
interesting
is that they're now not only owning it
publicly um but they are almost
celebrating that they're able to
use their own
news media and powerful journalists to
to spread it
as part of their war effort
as you say it's by no means new
you can trace it far back
in a
concentrated organized form back to
world war one
when the british established a
ministry of information
know what that means
the goal of the ministry of information
was to put out
horror stories about
german war crimes which would induce
americans to get into the war
woodrow wilson and it worked fury
u.s
liberal intellectuals
they were
taken they accepted it they said yes we
have to stop these horrible crimes that
british and
ministry of information is concocting in
order to mislead us
wilson president wilson set up his own
ministry of public information
meaning
lies to the public
to try to
encourage americans to hate everything
german so
boston symphony
orchestra wouldn't play beethoven for
example
then it goes on the
reagan had what's called an office of
public diplomacy
uh meaning an office to lie to the
public
and the media
about what we're doing
but uh
it's not a hard task for the government
and the reason was actually
stated
rather clearly by
the
public relations officer of the united
fruit company
back in
1954 when the u.s was
overthrown moving to overthrow the
democratic government of guatemala and a
vicious brutal dictatorship which has
killed hundreds of thousands of people
with u.s support ever since
he was asked
by the media
what about the
united fruit company efforts to
try to convince reporter journalists to
support this
he said yes we did it but you have to
remember how eager they were for the
experience
okay wasn't hard
they wanted it
we fed them these lies they were
delighted because they wanted to support
the state and its violence and terror
now that's not the journalists on the
ground
there is a split
as you described it's true of every war
so uh
in the uh
nicaragua in the central american wars
of the 1980s
there were great reporters on the ground
the vietnam war same thing
doing serious courageous work many
suffering for it
you get up to the newsrooms
looks totally different
it's
a fact about the media we don't have to
look far back
you can take a look at the new york
times
it's
best newspaper in the world which is not
a high bar
uh it's a
main course it's main
uh thinker
big thinker who writes serious articles
uh had an article just an editorial an
op-ed a day or two ago
saying
how can we deal with war criminals
what can we do where we're stuck
there's this war criminal
running russia how can we possibly deal
with them
the interesting thing about that article
is not so much that it appeared you'd
expect that kind of stuff
it's that it didn't elicit ridicule
in fact there was no comment on it
we don't know how to deal with war
criminals
sure we do
in fact we had a
clear exhibition of it just a couple of
days ago
one of the leading war criminals in the
united states
is
the man who ordered the invasion of
afghanistan and iraq
can't go far beyond that as being a war
criminal
and in fact on the 20th anniversary of
the invasion of afghanistan
he was there was one interview in the
press
to its credit the washington post did
interview him
in the style section
uh the interview is worth reading
it's about this
lovable
goofy grandpa
playing with his grandchildren
uh happy family uh
showing off the
portraits he painted of
great people he admitted
so we know how to deal with war
criminals
what's the problem we deal with them
very easily
nevertheless
this column could appear
in the world's greatest newspaper
which is interesting enough
and not elicit a word of comment which
is much more interesting
well
that tells you what you're talking about
as
tom mccann said the united fruit company
pr guy
they're eager for the experience doesn't
take much propaganda
so the government can work hard with its
uh
cognitive control systems
but it's pushing a open door
at the
editorial level and this has been true
as far back as you want to go and it
still is
you know charlie savage who is uh not an
op-ed writer but is an excellent
national security reporter for the new
york times um also had a piece that
dealt with some of this uh this week in
the new york times um and it was uh an
analytical piece looking at
the challenge that the u.s has made for
itself because of its grand hypocrisy uh
on on issues of an international
criminal court and and i just want to
summarize a little bit for for people
that maybe don't follow this the way
that you do or i do um but the the short
of it is that the united states uh has
consistently
been uh adamantly and militantly opposed
to any international judicial body that
would have jurisdiction over its own
actions
and in fact
in 2002
george w bush signed into law a
bipartisan piece of legislation uh that
came to be known as the hague invasion
act and and people can go up and go
online and read the the bill themselves
and it's still the law of the land in
the united states but uh one of the
clauses of that law states that the u.s
military can be authorized to literally
conduct a military operation in the
netherlands to
liberate any u.s personnel who are
brought there on war crimes uh charges
or under war crimes investigation that's
why it's called the you know by many
activists and civil libertarians the
hague invasion act
at the same time
joe biden himself has said vladimir
putin is a war criminal and has called
for a war crimes trial
well the united states itself has only
supported these ad hoc tribunals for
countries like yugoslavia or rwanda and
like russia the united states refuses to
ratify
the treaty that established the
international criminal court
i'm sure known that you and i both agree
that there are massive war crimes
being conducted right now in ukraine
certainly russia is the dominant
military power and i wouldn't be
surprised for one second
if if a huge percentage of the war
crimes being committed are being done by
russia that doesn't mean that there
aren't
uh war crimes being committed by ukraine
we already have video evidence of this
of both ukraine and russia but i don't i
want to want to be clear here i believe
that russia is committing systemic war
crimes in ukraine but when you have the
united states
undermining the international criminal
court refusing uh to ratify the treaty
how can joe biden call for a war crimes
trial
when dick cheney and george bush are
walking around as free men not to
mention henry kissinger and when the us
itself won't accept that that court
should have jurisdiction equally over
all powers in the world
well two
two questions points of fact you're
quite right
that the overwhelming
mass of the war crimes the ones that we
should be considering are
carried out by the russians that's
not in dispute
uh that's and they are major war crimes
it's also true that the united states
bloc totally blocked the icc
but notice there's nothing new about
that
the united st there's even a stronger
case
which has been
deep sixth
uh the united states is the only country
only country to have rejected a judgment
of the international criminal co of the
world court
there used to have two companions
hoja of albania
and gaddafi and libya but they were gone
so now the u.s stands in splendid
isolation
and having rejected the judgment of the
world court
that was in 1986
dealt with one of washington's minor
crimes the war against nicaragua
the
court
condemned the united states for
the words were unlawful use of force
meaning international terrorism
ordered the u.s to desist and pay
substantial reparations
well there was a reaction by the
reagan administration and congress
escalate the crimes
that was the reaction
there was a reaction in the press
new york times editorial
saying the court decision is irrelevant
because the court is a hostile forum
why is it a hostile forum
because it dared to accuse the united
states of crimes so that takes care of
that
so the reaction is to escalate the
crimes
uh nicaragua actually
uh sponsored the first security council
resolution which didn't mention the
united states just
called on all states to observe
international law
usv toted the u.s is on record
as saying to the security council
states should not observe international
law
then went to the general assembly
where
overwhelmingly approved a similar
reservation resolution
u.s opposed israel opposed
two states that say
states should not observe international
law
uh
well
all of that that's not part of history
as far as the united states is concerned
it's kind of history according to
republicans you shouldn't teach because
it's divisive it makes people feel bad
shouldn't teach it
but you don't have to tell anyone
because it's not taught and it's not
remembered virtually no one remembers it
and it goes beyond that
the united states in fact when the
major treaties
like the
organization of american states treaty
were signed back in the
40s the united states added reservations
saying basically not applicable to the
united states
in fact the united states very rarely
signs any conventions
very rarely and when it i mean ratifies
sometimes it signs the uh
and when it does ratify them they're
with reservations excluding the united
states
now that even includes the genocide
convention
there is a genocide convention
the united states finally ratified it
after i think about 40 years
but with the reservation saying
inapplicable to the united states
we are entitled to commit genocide
that came to the
international tribunals
the yugoslavia tribunal
or maybe it was the world court i don't
remember
yugoslavia charged nato
with uh
uh crimes in its attack on serbia
uh
the nato powers agreed to
the
uh
uh enter into the
uh
into the details of the court operations
the u.s refused
the u.s and it did on grounds that
yugoslavia had mentioned genocide
and the united states
is
self-immune
immunized from the charge of genocide
and the court accepted that correctly
countries are subject to jurisdiction
only if they accept it
well that's us
we can go on
we're
a rogue state the leading rogue state by
a huge
uh
uh dimension nobody's even close
uh
and
yet we can
call for war crimes trial of others
without betting at ilish
we can have even have
columns by the major columnist most
respected colonists saying how can we
deal with the war criminal
it's interesting to look at the reaction
to all of this
in the more civilized part of the world
the global south
they look at it
they condemn the invasion this is a
horrible crime
but the basic response is
what's new what's the fuss about
we've been subjected to this from you
from as far back as it goes
uh biden calls
uh
putin a war criminal yeah takes one to
no one
it's the basic reaction
you can see it simply by
looking at the sanctions map
the united states doesn't understand
why most of the world doesn't join in
sanctions
now which countries join in sanctions
take a look the map is revealing
the english-speaking countries
europe
and those who
apartheid south africa called honorary
whites
japan
with a couple of its former colonies
that's it
the rest of the world says
what yeah terrible but what's new what's
the fuss about
why should we get involved in your
hypocrisy
u.s can't understand that they're how
can they fail to condemn the crimes the
way we do
well
they do condemn the crimes the way we do
but they go a step beyond which we don't
uh
namely what i just described
well that means there's a lot of work to
do
in the united states
simply to raise the level of
civilization
to where we can see the world
the way the traditional victims see it
if we can rise to that level
we can act in a much more constructive
way
with regard to ukraine as well
what what do you see or how would you
analyze right now the posture of the
united states toward india and china in
particular i mean two massive uh
countries representing uh you know large
uh portion of the world's population uh
relative to the size of the united
states for for certain um but the the
the economic pressure that the united
states is uh is putting on both india
and china right now what are the
consequences
of of uh the u.s posture toward both
india and china right now
well it's different for one thing the
united states
is quite supportive of the indian
government india has a
neo-fascist government
the modi government is
working hard to destroy indian democracy
turn india into a
racist hindu kleptocracy
attack muslims
conquer you krashmir crush kashmir
not a word about that the united states
supports all that
very supportive it's close ally
close ally of israel
our kind of guy in other words so no
problem
the problem with india's doesn't go far
enough
it doesn't go as far as we want it to
to
join in the
uh
assault against russia
it it's playing a neutral game like most
of all of the global cells saying you
know it's a crime but we're not going to
get involved in your game
and the other thing is
india is
participating but not
as actively as the u.s would like
in its policy of
what the biden administration calls
encircling china
one of our major policy russia's kind of
a sideline but the major policy is to
encircle china
with what are called containment is out
of fashion so in circle china
with sentinel states
it's the term that's used uh armed to
the teeth
with massive offensive capacity
to
protect ourselves from what's called the
threat of china
that's a ring of states from
south korea
japan
australia
uh
india except india's
not joining actively enough
which we will provide we are providing
with
the wide administration as just recently
announced providing with advanced
precision
missiles aimed at china
in the case of australia
the united states
along with britain its
puppy dog
provided
australia with
is providing australia with advanced
nuclear submarines
advertised as
able to
get into chinese ports without
being detected
and to destroy the chinese fleet in two
or three days china has an ancient
uh
prehistoric fleet there they don't even
have nuclear submarines old-fashioned
diesel submarines
meanwhile the united states is
enhancing its own capacity to defend
ourselves
so far we have
trident nuclear submarines
which are able
to just each one one submarine
can destroy almost 200 cities anywhere
in the world
with a nuclear strike but that's not
enough
we're now moving to more advanced i
think it's called
virginia class submarines which will be
far more destructive
and we that's our policy towards china
we also have an economic policy
the united states just passed a
bipartisan
two-party supported
act to improve
u.s
uh technology science infrastructure
not because it would be good for the
united states
we couldn't consider that but because it
would compete with china
it's the competitive
for compete with china bill so if we
want to have
better science and technology because we
have to beat down china make sure china
doesn't get out of us
so let's not work with china to deal
with
truly existential problems like global
warming or
less serious but severe problems like
pandemics and nuclear weapons let's
compete with them and make sure we can
beat them down
that's what's important and get it get
ahead of them
it's a pathology
you can't imagine
anything more lunatic
incidentally what is the china thread
it's not
china's not a
got a very
brutal harsh government but that's not a
threat the u.s never cares about things
like that
deals with them easily
the china threat was actually there's an
interesting article about it by
an australian states and statesman
well-known international statesman
former prime minister paul keating
reviews the various
elements of the china thread
and concludes finally that the china
threat is that china exists
and he's correct
china exists and does not follow u.s
orders
that's no good
you have to follow u.s orders
if you don't you're in trouble well most
countries do
europe does
europe despises
u.s sanctions
against cuba
iran strongly opposes them but it
observes them because you don't step on
the toes of the godfather
so they observe u.s sanctions
china doesn't
china's engaged in
what the state department once called
successful defiance of
u.s
policies
that was 1960s
when the state department was explaining
why we have to torture
cuba
carry out a terrorist war against it
almost leading the nuclear war
imposed
highly destructive sanctions
we're still at it after 60 years
posed by the entire world
look at the votes in these general
assembly
184-2 u.s and israel we have to do it
as the
liberal state department
and i explained in the 1960s
because of cuba's successful defiance of
u.s policies
going back to 1823
the monroe doctrine which
stated
the u.s determination to dominate the
hemisphere
weren't strong enough to do it at the
time but that's the policy and cuba is
defying it
successfully
that's no good
china's not cuba
it's much bigger
it's successfully defying u.s policies
so no matter how brutal it is who cares
we support other brutal states all the
time but not successful defiance of u.s
policies
so therefore we have to encircle china
with sentinel states
with advanced weapons
aimed at china which we have to
maintain and upgrade
and ensure
that we overwhelm
anything in china's vicinity
that's part of our official policy of
because
was
formulated by the trump administration
jim mattis 2018 taken over by biden
we have to be able to fight and win
two wars
with china and russia
i mean that's
beyond insanity
a war with either china or russia means
nice knowing you
dubai civilization we're done
but we have to be able to win and fight
two of them
and now with biden we have to expand it
to encircling china with
sentinel states to which we provide more
advanced weapons
well we upgrade our huge destructive
capacity
like
we don't want those weak nuclear
submarines which can destroy 200 cities
that's
 stuff let's go beyond
and the uh
putin gave the united states a
tremendous gift
uh the war in ukraine was
criminal but also from his point of view
utterly stupid
he gave the united states the fondest
wish it could have
had handed europe to the united states
on a golden platter
there's
i mean throughout the whole cold war one
of the major issues in international
affairs
was whether europe
would become
an independent
force in international affairs
what was called a third force
maybe along the lines that charles the
goal outlined or that gorbachev outlined
at the
uh when russia when the soviet union
collapsed common urine european home
no military alliances
cooperation between europe and russia we
should become integrated into a
peaceful commercial bloc
that's one option
the other option is what's called the
atlanticist program
implemented by nato
the united states calls the shots
and you obey
that's the atlanticist program of course
the us has always
supported
that one
that has always won
now putin solved it
solved it for the united states is it
okay
you get europe as a subordinate
europe
goes ahead and arms itself to the teeth
to protect itself from an army
which europe
says
gleefully
is uncapable incapable of conquering
cities
uh 20 miles from its border
so therefore we have to arm ourselves to
the teeth
to defend ourselves from the onslaught
of this
extraordinarily powerful force against
the
nato
i mean if anybody's observing this from
outer space
and they'd be cracking up in laughter
but not in the offices of lockheed
martin
they think it's terrific
even better in the offices of exxonmobil
that's the interesting part
uh the
there were
some hopes not major hopes but some
hopes
of dealing with a climate crisis
that is going to destroy organized human
life on earth
not tomorrow but
in the process of doing it
current
most plausible projections or
three degrees centigrade
increase over pre-industrial levels by
20 by the end of the century that's
catastrophic i mean doesn't mean
everybody dies but it's on to total
catastrophe well there were
moves to stop that now they've been
reversed
the you look at the stuff that's coming
out of the energy corporations
they're euphoric
first we've got all these annoying
environmentalists out of our air
they don't bother us anymore in fact now
we're being loved
for saving civilization and that's not
enough they say we want to be hugged
their word we want to be hugged
by saving civilization
by rapidly expanding the production of
fossil fuels which will destroy
everything
but put more cash in our pockets during
the period that remains
that's what
somebody from outer space would be
looking at
that's us
okay
i know gnome we have to wrap up but i do
want to note that uh you know just in
recent days we've heard now that the
white house is proposing a
record-shattering uh military budget uh
in excess of
813 billion dollars and you know this
would be a much longer conversation if
we kept it going but it's really a
number of very significant uh things
have happened over the course of this
war from the perspective of the u.s and
nato among them germany lifting its cap
on the amount of uh of its gdp that it
will spend on defense uh the the
pipeline of of weapons and you know many
european countries have been uh you know
very hesitant to get super involved with
transferring weapons systems and now
there's discussion of even more
permanent nato bases and i i think part
of what you're getting at which which i
think is important for people to
understand is that
vladimir putin
for whatever reasons he made the
decision to do this in ukraine
ultimately has created conditions that
the u.s has long wished were there uh
for the united states to
uh assert total dominance over european
decision-making on
issues of militarism it also is an
enormous boondoggle for uh the the war
industry and i you know i think that
it's incarcerated
and the fossil fuel industry and the
fossil fuel industry and and you know i
think that as we watch
the horrors of human destruction and
mass murder happening in ukraine um you
know we also must find a way to think of
the long-term consequences of the
actions of our own government and
unfortunately when you raise these
issues when i raise them when others do
right now in the in the u.s media
context there is this neo-mccarthyite
response where to question the dominant
narrative or to question the motives of
those in power
is is now treated as as an act of of uh
of treason or it's traitorous or you are
a putin stooge or being paid in rubles
this is a very dangerous trend that
we're witnessing where to question the
state
now is being uh very publicly and
consistently equated with being a
traitor
that's
an old story
i want it's an old story but it also is
but with social media and the fact that
so many people now could have their
comments spread around and the cohesion
of messaging that we're seeing it is an
old story gnome of course and you've
written multiple books about this very
phenomenon what i'm getting at is that
it now is just permeating every aspect
of our culture where to question
those in power which is the job of
journalists which is the the the job of
thinking responsible people in in a
democratic society those things are
being
uh attacked as acts of uh treason
basically
as always has been the case
we have a dramatic example of it right
in front of us
julian assange a
perfect example of a
journalist who did the job of
providing the public
with information
that the government wanted suppressed
information some of the u.s crimes but
other things
so he's been subjected
to years of torture
torture
that's the un repertoire and tortures
decision now being held in a high
security prison
subjected to
the possibility of extradition to the
united states will be severely punished
for daring to do what a journalist is
supposed to do now take a look at the
way the media are reacting to this
first of all they used everything
wikileaks exposed
happily used it
you know made money out of it improved
their reputations
are they supporting assange
on this attack
on the person
who
performed the
honorable duty of a journalist and is
now being tortured
not that i've seen
they're not supporting it
would use what he did but then we'll
join the jackals who are
snapping at his feet
okay that's now
it goes far back
you go back to
1968
uh
68 the peak of the war in vietnam
peak when first when real mass populated
popular opinion was developing
mcgeorge bundy
national security advisor for kennedy
and johnson
wrote a very interesting article in
foreign affairs maine establishment
journal
in which he said well you know
there are
legitimate criticisms of
some of what we've done in vietnam like
we made tactical errors we should have
done things a little different
and then he said there are also
the wild men in the wings
who question
our
policies beyond tactical decisions
terrible people well
we're democratic country so we don't
kill them but you gotta get rid of these
wild men in the wings
1968
and go to 1981
uh
u.n ambassador gene kirkpatrick devised
the notion
moral equivalence
he said if you dare to criticize the
united states you're guilty of moral
equivalence
you're saying we're just like stalin and
hitler so he can't talk about the united
states
there's another term that's used now
it's what about ism
if you talk about what the us is doing
right now it's what about ism
can't do that you got to adhere
firmly to the party line
strictly to the party line
we don't have the kind of force that
hitler and stalin had
but we can use
obedience conformity
kind of things we've been talking about
and you get a sort of similar result
not new and yes you're right has to be
combated
we have to
deal with what's happening and that
includes what we are now doing to
ukraine
as
we've discussed
both by inaction
and action
we're fighting
to the last ukrainian to quote
ambassador freeman again
and it should be legitimate to say that
if you care anything about ukrainians
if you don't care anything about them
fine just silence it
on that note uh nom chomsky i want to
thank you very much for taking the time
to be with us and and for all of your
work i really appreciate you taking the
time this evening
good to talk to you
