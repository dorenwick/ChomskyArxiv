take what's happening in education uh
right now last recent years there's a
strong tendency to uh require assessment
of children and teachers so that you
have to teach to tests and the test
determines what happens to the child and
what happens to the teacher that's
guaranteed to destroy any meaningful
educational process it means a teacher
cannot be created
imaginative pay attention to individual
students needs the student can't pursue
things that maybe some kid is interested
in something you can't do it because you
got to memorize something for this test
tomorrow and the teachers's future
depends on it as well as the students
these are all ways of uh you know the
people who sitting in the offices the
bureaucrats and designing this like you
say they're not evil people but uh
they're working within a system of
ideology and do Rines which turns what
they're doing into something extremely
harmful first of all you don't have to
assess people all the time I mean if a
person's kind of doing their job kids
are getting along and things that's fine
then go ahead I mean people don't have
to be ranked in terms of some
artificial the the assessment itself is
completely artificial it's not ranking
teachers in accordance with their
ability to help develop children who
reach their potential explore their
creative interests and so on those
things can you're not testing so you're
giving some kind of a rank but it's a
rank that's mostly meaningless and the
Very ranking itself is harmful it's
turning us into individuals who try who
devote Our Lives to achieving a rank not
into doing things that are valuable and
important it's uh
it's highly destructive at the lower at
you know this is say Elementary
education so you're training kids this
way and it's very harmful I could see
with my own children when my own kids
were in elementary school a what's
called a good school you know good
quality suburban school by the time they
were in third grade they were dividing
up their friends at the dumb and
smart uh you're dumb if you're lower
track you're smart if you're upper
tracked I mean think what that does to
the children doesn't matter where
they're track the children who take it
seriously like we could kind of you know
help them not take it seriously but uh
if you're caught up in that it's just
extremely harmful and it has nothing to
do with
education education is uh developing
your own potential and creativity I mean
maybe you're not going to do well in
school and you'll do great in art that's
fine you know what's what's wrong with
that that's another way to be a live a
fulfilling uh Wonderful Life and a one
that's significant for other people as
well as yourself people and but so the
whole idea is is first of all wrong in
itself and it's harming the it's
creating a kind of it's kind of a system
of creating something that's called
economic man there's a concept of
economic man which is you know economics
literature and so on and economic man is
somebody who rationally calculates how
to improve his own status and Status
means basically wealth so you rationally
calculate uh how what kinds of choices
you should make to increase your wealth
and you don't pay any attention to
anything else and or maybe maximize the
number of goods you have because that's
what you can measure those are things
you can measure so those we that and if
you do that properly you know you're
kind of a rational person making
informed judgments you can improve your
what's called your human capital you
know what you can sell on the
market what kind of a human being is
that I mean is that the kind of human
human being you want to create and the
all of these mechanisms that you're
describing like uh you know testing
assessing evaluating measuring they
force people to have to develop those
character characteristics the ones who
don't do it are considered maybe
behavior problems or some some other
deviant maybe something goes wrong then
they drop out and maybe try to survive
on drugs or something that's uh or take
if it's in Mexico they become what are
called illegal immigrants because you've
driven them off the land uh that's uh
these things
have these ideas and Concepts have come
consequences and it's not just that
they're ideas there are huge Industries
devoted to trying to instill them uh the
public relations industry advertising
and marketing and so on it's a huge
industry it's maybe a sixth of gross
domestic product and it's a propaganda
industry it's a propaganda industry
designed to create a certain type of
human being the one who can maximize
consumption and can disregard uh the his
actions on others U it's massive it
starts with H infants you know in fact
there was a I remember a study recently
which made some publicity about uh the
advertisers discovered you know realized
that there's a segment of the population
that they're not reaching you have to
reach everyone but there was a segment
they weren't reaching children uh
because children don't have incomes so
the advertisers had sort of not targeted
them but some smart guy realized that
you can get the children to be consumers
by inducing them to nag their parents so
a branch of psychology developed
literally in the universities and
applied psychology psychology of nagging
how you can nag this way if you want
that thing and you can nag the other way
if you don't want the other and so on
and you take a look at um remember
watching television with my little my
grandchildren when they were little
they're Deluge with
uh propaganda that tells them you've got
to have this uh you know $400 uh
mechanical uh something or other so make
your get your parents to do it you know
get them to understand that you're just
not going to you're going to be
miserable and your friends will hate you
and your life won't be worthwhile unless
you get this thing that's what our
culture is designed to do and it's a
huge industry actually in the early back
in the 1920s it was called
propaganda uh the major text of the pr
industry by one of its gurus Edward
bernai back in the 20s was called
propaganda and that's what it was we
don't call it that anymore the word
propaganda has a kind of a bad
connotation so it's called I don't know
what but but it's exactly the same thing
