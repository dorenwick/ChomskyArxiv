greetings we're here with Professor Nome
tomsky at MIT who's the world's most
cited living author and the reason I
bring that up all the time is because I
want to bring attention to how often
he's not seen on TV if he's the most
sight living author what don't they want
you to hear that he has to say well
anyway the reason that that I'm here
today gnome is that um I've run for
Congress a couple times as you know and
what I've seen and what's um a
disturbing Factor I've seen is the rise
of the libertarian party in the United
States and I want to ask
you
to give us a little background on the
history of how libertarian
libertarianism in the US has strayed
from its uh origins in
Europe well the libertarian conceptions
basically come out of Classical
liberalism uh 17th 18th century
Classical
liberalism uh and uh it's uh the core
principles of Classical liberalism were
opposition to illegitimate Authority uh
people should be free from constraints
and controls by uh authoritarian Arian
structures which have no inherent
legitimacy basically one or another form
of tyranny or domination so in the early
days they were concerned with feudalism
with tyrannical States and so on in the
by the late 19th century on through the
20th century the major some of the major
authoritarian illegitimate structures
are the corporate system the PRI private
tyrannies
right Corporation is basically a tyranny
right dominated from the top take orders
from above get down below F at the
bottom you can rent yourself you have no
part I it doesn't even pretend to have
anything like popular Democratic control
uh the uh with the libertar with the
so-called libertarian movement in the
United States which incidentally people
I of friends I often agree with them on
but uh but their policies whatever their
goals may be their policies tend are
tend to drive people under the control
of the worst possible form of
tyranny uh unaccountable private tyranny
and that's the opposite of
libertarianism right well I know notice
that in the in the debates and so forth
well actually going back to the 2004
Vice Presidential debate
um it was interesting because they had a
green there and and they also had a
Libertarian and the libertarian whenever
it came to social issues he was like
well we leave that up to the community I
mean they had it right with the drug war
they had it right with you know not not
being you know the US getting involved
in all these interventions you know to
get out of those but when it comes to
social policy it's like well we leave
that up to the community communities
aren't doing a very good job they can
leave that up to the community now who's
the community
the community is not a collection of
people who are equal in opportunity and
power the community the society consists
of a highly inegalitarian structure with
extreme wealth and power concentrated in
a very small sector and most people
disempowered that's the community so if
you leave things up to the community
what you're in effect saying is yeah
let's let the top fraction of 1% in
wealth and power determine everything
right and what are they going to
determine well in their interest so
that's the this is again I'm not saying
whoever the speaker was believes this
but the implications the consequences of
this pretense that you're leaving things
to a community of equal participants is
just wildly off base right you're
leaving it to a community of people uh
within a group within which a tiny
percentage actually literally a fraction
of 1% have overwhelming power and
opportunity and as you move down the
scale less and less and most of them are
simply disempowered well what I'm
worried about is that we're coming up um
you know Charlie Reese wrote a an
article entitled 545 p people in this he
made an argument that uh you know with
the you've got the Senate you've got the
the
uh the Congress and uh and you got the
president and nine Supreme Court members
so other than that so you have 536 of
those people we choose and and well I
mean sort of with the electoral process
that we we all know that we don't
actually choose them right for one thing
a large part of the population doesn't
even bother a vote oh I know that
reasons for it but you know that my
struggle Against All Odds has been to
try to get these uh election actually
incidentally last time I mean I was
included in the debate and but the
Republican didn't show so they didn't
televise it so if it's not put over the
propaganda box it's like as if it it
didn't even happen but what I fear is
that with the rise of the third party it
seems like the green party in the US the
libertarian party is rising that the
green party is going is is is lessening
and I just want to see more well there's
a reason for that the libertarian party
whatever the goals and intentions of the
individuals is a party whose programs
favor concentrated wealth and power but
they're fooling a lot of regular folks
relatively acceptable right they're
fooling a lot of regular folks though
that's what I'm saying I'm saying
perfectly nice people you know these may
be people who say look I really believe
in Freedom Liberty equality and so on
but take a look at their policies their
policies say for example remove
regulation on financial institutions
right what does that do it frees them uh
to concentrate power to punish the rest
of us and of course in the background is
something that's not s said takes say
financial institutions uh the the
government actually in many ways
uh is designs policies which ensure that
the taxpayer subsidizes those institu oh
of course of course that's not discussed
no that's not discussed well um inly
that's not a joke it was recently an IMF
study international monetary fund study
of the uh profits of the major I think a
half dozen major US Banks and it traced
them almost entirely to a tcid
government insurance policy that is a a
a tacid commitment that they won't be
allowed to crash now that it's not just
the bailouts that's a small part of it
they get access to cheap credit they get
inflated credit ratings they're uh they
have the opportunity of making very
risky and hence profitable Investments
because if they collapse taxpayer will
step in and bail them out all of that
contributes enormous ly to their profits
the business press Bloomberg estimated
the implicit taxpayer subsidy at about
over 80 billion dollar a year right now
what do you say to the person who says
uh well libertarian socialism that's an
oxymoron that's an an oxymoron in the
United States because in the United
States libertarian means uh support for
capitalist autocracy and yes would be an
oximoron to talk about a socialist uh
support for capitalist autocracy but
that's a US term but here here it's
funnyism in the world me the legacy of
Classical liberalism which is quite
different workers struggles like say
John Stewart Mill outstanding figure of
Classical liberalism was in favor of
worker ownership of
Enterprises wow okay cuz when you talk
about some of these things I'm makeing
it so the average Joe or Jane can
understand in the United States yeah in
in the United States off the Spectrum
this is a business run Society to an
unusual extent well they got funding
supposedly well not the race the guy I
was running against but somebody else I
heard that he got fing from the Coke
brothers and brought yeah C Brothers
call themselves
Libertarians and you know meanwhile
they're lavished with huge government
subsidies protected in all sorts I mean
even the
Pentagon uh is to a substantial extent a
subsidy for the energy corporations
right
their pipon sea lands the Energy System
working for them and so on well I'm
that's a small part of it I'm hoping
that the green party can be seen as
something apart from tree hugging not
that that's bad Tree Huggers or whatever
that phrase is interesting see in a
highly indoctrinated Society like ours
if you're trying to protect the commons
from Attack by private power you're
denounced as tree hugging right that's
if you can't answer the arguments you
use invective I know and they use and
it's powerful I mean they can change
like green can become a bad word I
remember like the AIDS appetite
suppressant candy and then all of a
sudden you don't see commercials for
that after AIDS the effect of propaganda
is pretty dramatic one interesting case
is uh right of current great current
concern is the health system if there
have been polls in the United States for
decades and which which show that the
population some is it most of people are
in favor of some kind of national
healthare yeah they had other countries
of course it's never even been
considered the public option was but not
the public option was is it when Obama
used his Affordable Care Act yeah there
initially there was a proposal for a
public option right it was favored by a
large majority of the population it was
dropped without discussion I know
because what the population wants
absolutely doesn't matter but the
propaganda uh has been so intense that
by now that as soon as Obama's proposal
was instituted the propaganda
created substantial in fact
majority opposition to it which remains
even though it's a small step towards
what the public has always wanted well I
don't I some I mean in my opinion it's a
step away from it because I'm worried
that it it you know it mandated
corporate insurance so now they're not
going to want to get that up very easily
yeah those profiteers are not going to
want to give that up it it does remember
before that that that's all there was
right well I know a lot of people that's
why I say this is a small step towards
uh offering people some kind of possible
health care you'd be surprised I mean I
have Facebook friends and stuff who had
their their uh their hours cut back so
they don't meet so they don't have to
fit into the ACA they their employers
don't have to cover them so now you have
a lot of people I don't I don't know if
the ACA did anything for anybody really
no it did look there's tens of Millions
of people who were uninsured who now
have some form of medical aid and
there's people like me who are going to
be fine because I'm in the middle well
there are people who for whom it may not
have held maybe I think it's 19 but
overwhelmingly it's been a small step
forward I mean just take a look at uh
first of all huge numbers of people who
are completely without medical uh care
now have an opportunity for it they're
insured furthermore the insurance
companies are now and prevented from uh
from using a prior medical history right
a prior history very significant I was
asked about that in and it's kind of
intriguing that it's called
Obamacare that's like tree hugging yeah
that's to demonize it by uh uh
associating it with this hated figure
incidentally black which doesn't hurt
well something well two other even the
Liberals call it Vol yeah oh it's you
know and I'll tell you something out
there talking to thousands and thousands
of people that's the reasons the
Republicans were voted in I mean they
this ACA I mean you talk to people who
are like somebody who's working 40 hours
a week and then gets cut down to 28
hours that's not I that's very marginal
the main thing that's happened is that
enormous numbers of people tens of
millions have been given the opportunity
to have medical care
I mean there are cases of the kind to
mention but not much U well I know a few
of them and I'm one of the ones who
going to be fine well put it this way if
if he's I from what I understand it it
19 out of 20 are covered shouldn't we
live in a society with 20 out of 20 or
cover that's why I say it's a small step
and it would have been cheaper small
cover much cheaper everybody it would
have been much cheaper thr the midd just
to extend Medicare to the whole
population exactly but but be clear it's
a small step the in the United States
government uh funding of medical care is
about at the level of other industrial
countries but that's about half of total
the total cost since we have to go
through a privatized system costs are
inflated so it's roughly twice the per
capita cost of other countries and
pretty poor outcomes but that's because
of the private ized element uh if you
there's a ton of
bureaucracy payment in fact the costs
are vastly
underestimated even this figure twice as
high as other countries standard figure
that's an underestimate and that's for
for ideological reasons economists do
not count the cost to
individuals so if suppose you say
recently my wife had to get get uh you
know go through this system to get
insurance well you know it takes days of
work you have to work through a maze of
bureaucracy you try to use the web it
crashes oh it's crazy you call somebody
you wait for an hour till you can speak
to them all of these are costs these are
huge costs but the individuals so
they're not counted same is true quite
generally I suppose you get a bank
statement and there's a mistake in it
and you want to get the bank to fix it
so you call the number you get an
automated response with a menu that
doesn't have what you want right and you
push try talk to then you sit there for
half an hour listening to music while
every once's in a while an automated
voice says you know we appreciate
your finally you get some human being
maybe solve it that's a cost to you
right and that cost to spread over huge
numbers of people people and but those
are not counted by economists what they
count is the cost to the business so
this may be profitable for the business
so it's called efficient but it's it's
not it's uh costly for the population
but that's not called inefficient these
are ideological decisions if we included
them then the cost of US Medical Care
would not be twice as high as other
countries it' be far beyond that it's a
extremely inefficient system for people
quite inefficient for the efficient for
the rich and that's the way policy is
designed and if you follow the
libertarian proposals so-called
libertarian proposals that's what the
world will be like even more so than
today so what would you think now
Libertarians when it comes to I mean
they're against the ACA but they what
are they what are they in favor of I
don't know we know what they're in favor
of takes a rent Paul who's a doctor of
some kind yeah he's something but he
said one at one point that he's opposed
to any government involvement in health
care because it's the same as slavery he
says I'm a doctor and if the government
orders me to take care of someone that's
slavery yeah that's libertarianism in
other words if you can pay for it maybe
able do it for you if you can't I'm not
going to do it why should I go but if we
had public option the doctor would still
be paid
yeah but he wouldn't be paid but but he
would be compelled to do something at a
cost below what somebody else would pay
him well that's I'll tell you when I was
interviewed if you work only for the
rich you don't have to take care of the
people who come in as same with an
emergency room at a hospital you know if
somebody comes into we we actually have
National Health Care in the United
States it's called emergency rooms if
you can get into an emergency room they
have to take care of you yeah uh and
that's extraordinarily costly even from
the point of view of the of say
economists measures and for human beings
it's tremendously costly you sit in the
emergency room for hours days and you
know so on and so for but uh ran Cole's
position was I don't want to be forced
to take care of people I don't want
emergency rooms to exist I want to just
do what I what I choose for the R so
here here we are I mean in the US we
rank I think it's in the in the like
around 35 or something like that in life
expectancy uh I remember you criticized
this in manufacturing consent when we
were in the low 20s and now the figures
are are rankings are up there I think it
last I saw was 36 it's funny because in
debate I mentioned I said in a high 40s
because there's different figures you
see and the guy Twisted it around in the
paper and he said that I said that
people live to be in their High
40s and and uh you know we're not doing
that that that great with the system
here I remember as a chiropractor when I
left the office um Medicare was good
when I started it was bad but it became
one of the better insurances because all
the rest had gotten increasingly worse
when you're you know you had some middle
person in there calling the shots is is
like well Medicare is interesting it's
it's much more efficient than the
private system but it is expensive
because it has to work through the
private system yeah that those are the
extra costs of Medicare like I have
Medicare you know goes my age but uh it
does work through the private system you
still have to pick a private insurance
policy oh it's secondary all of those
are costs well when you say public
option in Medicare for oil you say I
mean we really should do away with that
other with the co together all together
like most in most countries of the world
you know my wife Happ to come from
Brazil if you're ill in Brazil you could
you go to a doctor you go to a hospital
now actually that's a little bit
misleading because in many countries the
public system is underfunded so the
wealthy will go to private doctors and
private hospitals right so it's still
kind of two tiered but in a different
way but at least for the general
population you're guaranteed some level
of Health Care with no cost
well I certainly hope that with these uh
in the upcoming elections I mean people
are fed up if you look at what the
Republicans the Democrats are putting
out there for the presidency it's really
it's really terrible I hope that we take
a take a look at the figures on respect
for uh the political system way down
there Congress it's single digit single
digits the president maybe you know 15%
even the Supreme Court which used to be
high up I think is in the low 20s now
well people are getting aware but they
still they still consider Outsiders as
spoilers and we don't have time to get
into that um that's actually the book
I'm writing is called election spoilers
and I'm saying that the spoilers of the
media who censor the candidates not the
candidates who challenge the
system you know and and there's not much
difference between the the the two as
time goes on I mean they're both
corporate funded parties well what's
happened over the years years is both
parties have shifted to the right
exactly and the Republicans have shifted
so far that they're simply off the
Spectrum off the spect they're not a
parliamentary party anymore no they're
in fact one of the leading U
conservative commentators Norman orstein
very respected conservative political
analyst American Enterprise Institute he
simply described the modern Republican
party is a radical
Insurgency which is abandoned in any
commitment to the Parliamentary process
yeah and you can see that in the last
and they get away with it yeah they're
getting away so far oops Here Comes our
break you you've got to do this the ball
just you've said and I've said this is
the reason I'm doing this our planet's
future is at stake right now if we don't
turn this thing
around well actually U this is the first
time in human history when we have to
make decision Visions which will
determine whether our
grandchildren have a decent world to
live in we're advancing towards a
precipice which we might fall over in
which case the chances for decent human
survival are finished and there are
basically two crucial problems one is
nuclear weapons we've by a miracle
virtual Miracle we've survived the last
70 years without destroying ourselves
it's always a there's always a chance
the other is a simply climate
catastrophe right which is coming along
and uh we can try to deny it if we like
but that's determining the fate of our
future Generations I hope people wake up
on that election time that's what I hope
because well you know actually the
population is in favor of stronger
action but the uh decision making
classes are not no so you read say the
newspapers they tell you about the
marvels
of the
great expansion of fossil fuel
production it's going to lead to a
century of energy Independence whatever
that means oil companies are prepared if
the current glut declines to pour new
oil into the market it's just wonderful
except that it's destroying ourselves
it's unbelievable what people do for
profit well I hope that things do turn
around in the next election I mean as
far those 545 people who Charlie ree
brought up I mean basically uh well
Governors have a little bit take say
congress Mitch McConnell his chief
priority is to ensure that we maximize
the use of the most destructive fossil
fuels namely coal because his his Rich
con constituents can be make profit from
profit over people at the expense of the
world it can't in this case it's really
Leal and Germany is is shutting down
their nuclear fa you get the solar we
you get the geothermal we you get the
hemp we could that's the most successful
we could deal with this capitalist
economy in the world and they're moving
toward sustainable Anarchy wow well I
hope we end up doing the same because we
don't have much time got to keep
fighting definitely
