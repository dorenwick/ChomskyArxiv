very
good okay um well you remember I'm sure
that uh right after d 11 George W bush
uh made a speech in which he had a kind
of a plaintive plea he asked uh why do
they hate us and answer was they hate
our freedom uh our uh initiative all the
wonderful things about our society well
actually he shortly after that the
Pentagon uh ran did organized a study by
the defense science board to answer the
question of why do they hate us
responding to Bush right and they said
it's not that they hate our freedom is
that we hate their freedom uh they hate
our policy they don't hate us they hate
the policies that we've been carrying
out he went through them uh the Wall
Street Journal to its credit did a poll
right at about the same time of just of
Muslims but only the kind that they are
interested in the ones with Bankers
professionals people embedded in the
US International global economic system
and so on and uh they they
they investigate their attitudes about
the United States and of course they're
not opposed to the neoliberal system
they're part of it they're not opposed
to the capitalist Imperial structure
they're part of it what they said is
that they're opposed to two things
primarily one the sanctions against Iraq
which had killed hundreds of thousands
of people and just devastated the
society right we so close to genocidal
that the two International diplomats who
respected diplomats who presided over
them presided over the oil for food
program uh Dennis H and Hunt vpon they
actually both resigned in protest W
because they said they're violating the
genocide conventions and and the other
thing was the treatment of the
Palestinians the US support for Israeli
oppression of the Palestinians wow so
that's why they didn't ha us but that's
what they're opposed to that's what
they're in fact Bush wasn't the first
president to ask why do they hate us uh
what the Press should have
reported is that uh Dwight Eisenhower
when he was president asked the same
question he asked this it's all
Declassified years ago uh he asked the
staff uh why is there a campaign of
hatred against us among the Arab people
and not the governments they're fine but
the pop the people people why why why is
their campaign of hatred against us
right at the same time the National
Security Council main planning body that
came out with a study about this uh it
again long Declassified and what it
concluded is that U as almost quoting
they said there's a perception in the
Arab world that the United States
supports
dictatorships and uh repression and
blocks democracy and development and uh
uh that we do it because we want to gain
control of their oil supplies and it
went on to say that the perception is
more or less accurate and furthermore
that's what we ought to be doing uh now
going back to the Wall Street Journal
2001 survey of moneyed Muslims as they
called them they repeated that too they
said problem is the apart from the BR
particular cases that I mentioned the US
supports
dictatorships harsh brutal repression
blocks democracy and development now we
do it because we want to maintain
control of their resources now this
happened under Eisenhower Eisenhower it
was under his clock that we invaded Iran
and overthrew Muhammad musch yeah but
that wasn't one of the issues that the
national that that was in I mean that's
just one of it yes we support
dictatorship in Iran but it were else
too you know I want to cover a lot of
Elementary truths that'll keep the
people going and there's something that
we've talked about in the past you said
Afghanistan and that uh Afghanistan
women had a right to vote before uh
women in the United States about the
same time maybe a year or two before wow
what happened from there in the 19 early
1920s I forgot the exact date but early
1920s wow that's just it's remarkable
that something like that could be uh
well we went
long time after the Declaration of
Independence before women were regarded
as authentic people right right and in
fact you know women's rights are still
an issue of a struggle it was since the
70s and the 80s there was a great
expansion of women's right you know um
it seems like uh well since I saw you
last the Occupy Movement started and now
they seem to be uh coming down on that
and not only that but this the thing
that scares me uh is and as as we talk
today I don't believe that it's uh been
signed or vetoed yet is Senate bill 1867
the way it stands now which would say
basically that they can take anybody any
time um for no reason and hold them
indefinitely now Obama said uh he'd veto
it but I'm not sure if he's going to
veto it uh well actually that's that's
that's the way it came across at first
and it did elicit a lot of uh discussion
internet and other discussion however
the Senate watered it down but not much
but they can still do that technically
they said technically they could always
have done it right but so what it
effectively did it appears so far where
it stands now is it sort of reinforces
existing law which is pretty awful the
Patriot Act basically Patriot Act and
other legislation which
uh implements it so you don't think
they'll come uh if this law passes cuz I
see that people are getting frightened
already and they ought to be frighten
what's of the law not frighten to stand
up to it um it's I I keep a close eye on
it because it looks as if right now that
they that the Senators who initiated it
have backed off and have said that it
will not change existing law but
existing law is bad enough existing law
does permit
indefinite permanent Detention of so far
non-citizens but uh not much you know
they were already Obama's already
authorized murder of American citizens
so the Detention of them wouldn't be
much farther right however this I I
wouldn't I think focusing on this
particular law is a little misleading
it's the existing body of Law and
practice that's the real danger and this
is maybe moving into a little bit
further but not much yeah it is a step
in that direction it's it's it's scary I
mean didn't at Eisenhower you mentioned
before I mean it is it is farewell
addressed of the nation and the councils
of government we must guard against the
acquisition of power whether sought or
unsought by the military industrial
complex now we had half of our spending
going toward the military and here we
are having to cut back cut back cut back
and all that money's being spent and um
you know we certainly don't seem to be
heeding his words it's expanding in fact
yeah Obama just uh is now sending
Marines to Australia they're the usas up
there with quite a few bases in
Australia this would be a new one
obviously aimed at China the uh they're
building a base in South Korea juu
Island there's big protest about that on
the island but looks like the United
States and South Korea will build a
major Naval Base they also aimed at
China uh and this is uh building up for
a potential conflict which is now Russia
and China aren't too happy with us oh no
with the way and and maybe that balance
of power is is what's needed
I we interrupt this broadcast moving
right
along the Occupy
Movement it's supposedly one part of it
I don't like is at the 1% I think that
1% we've talked about this it really
should be subdivided into like one1 of
1% uh but other than that um it's an
interesting time right now it seems like
they're trying to wait you know they're
trying to put more pressure on on their
end and the people are trying to put
more pressure on uh like last time we
talked and I said descent was high no
not descent frustration well now it's
descent you know it has led to that next
step occupy we talked was before this
right right before yeah this is a pretty
remarkable development I mean it's yeah
late too late I think and but great that
it's happening it's the first major
popular reaction to over a generation
over 30 years of really a pretty violent
attack on the population yeah you take a
look at what's happened in the last 30
years it's a bitter class War uh the
economy shifted pretty dramatically
towards finance and uh
de-industrialization offshoring of
production uh the effects were numerous
one was the very high concentration of
wealth as you say it's the top one10 of
1% is wildly overweighting the
distribution and for the for the rest of
the population you know the 99% it's
symbolically for the large majority it's
a stagnation or decline it's crazy I
heard on the radio up that on the way up
here that they uh said one out of four
children is hungry in the United States
yeah it's a very severe period uh
unemployment real unemployment is
essentially at depression levels and
there's a difference during the
Depression which I'm old enough to
remember U unemployed uh working people
most of my family in fact had a
realistic
expectation at least after the mid-30s
that the things would get better there
are things you can do about it the CIO
was organizing the WPA was functioning
the uh there was a general hopefulness
things will come back we'll get over
this we'll work together and get over
it's not true now no it's things are on
their present course those jobs are not
coming back I don't see how they can get
them back they they got us involved in
the trade agreements and uh they can get
them back but they well they could but
not with the way that uh if you still
have puppets like for instance Levan who
uh who uh co-sponsor or I think he he
may have even written it up and then and
McCain I well anyway he and McCain were
in on this uh uh you know throwing in
this amendment uh along with the
National Defense authorization act and
uh but Le Lev or lean rather is uh I
interviewed somebody in Michigan who was
running
against him for Senate in 2002 and I
mean he he's everybody donates to him he
had hogged all the corporate money and I
mean he he's owned and for these
business people to be making decisions
like this and now new Gingrich is going
to go ahead and ask uh Donald Trump I
was glad that even Fox TV was mocking
them I mean even the next two people
they were merciless I was I was
surprised now this was five in the
morning maybe there's a little different
as 5: in the morning like when I was
introduced to you and fact and consent
uh no Chomsky in the media was in the
middle of the night you know sometimes
they do give you a a bit of the truth
they throw it out there and then they
but they don't leave it up for very
long and you know they I mean mocking
kimridge for saying we'll bring in
businessmen is a kind of a joke who who
doesn't exactly well he made it sound
like he was being uh unique in so doing
or know that his party was unique in so
doing and that's not true both parties
take a look at uh Obama's economic team
it's uh all people from the Reuben gang
coming straight out of the financial
sector not just the ones who were
responsible for a lot the troubles were
in now right I mean they they basically
the guys who brought about the crisis
were called in to put bandaids on it and
uh not too surpris in ly the proposals
that they came up with greatly benefited
the U the big Banks and investment firms
who were responsible for the crisis and
the rest of the population was left
to fly in the wind actually the the
original tarp legislation if you look at
it was a bargain uh it was going to be
at the legislation calls for U bailing
out the banks but also giving relief for
the victims the victims of subprime
mortgages foreclosures and so on they
were supposed to be compensated and
supported well only the first half of
that legislation was ever implemented
yeah actually the Inspector General of
uh who's in charge of it wrote about it
later very angrily so it was and the the
bailout is only a small part of it uh
less talked about is the huge amount
probably trillions of dollars of cheap
loans which are basically gifts to the
uh to the Goldman Sachs and others like
if somebody
lends if you can take out a loan at some
very low interest rate and you can turn
that money into treasur Securities where
you get a higher interest rate you can
get quite Rich it doesn't take a genius
to do it and that's essentially the way
it was
done now getting back to the the job
situation um and and just the the
inefficiency of the country uh the
Cannabis issue again has been uh
actually even the governor of New Jersey
the other day was saying that the drug
war had failed I mean this is an
inefficiency we cannot afford I I
brought this up before we have over
800,000 arrests for possession of a
plant every year and um meanwhile like
some 800,000 kids go missing well
obviously our resources are being wasted
uh you know chasing people for uh you
know the basically the propaganda that
of Harry anslinger which is really where
it all originated from that's just in an
inefficiency and really a horrible thing
I mean people thrown in cages uh that's
it's not I mean I was in the healing
Wars it doesn't make sense to me that we
would harm innocent people for what they
do is that the land of of Liberty that's
uh well this is the same 30 plus years
uh the incarceration rate in the United
States
in 1980 yeah was roughly the same as uh
other industrial countries slightly
toward the high end but within the
Spectrum now since then it's just shot
up every president is now five to 10
times as high uh and it's mostly
victimless crimes yeah that y it's crazy
and it's also very uh it's established
what some call a new JY Crow it's
targetting
African-Americans
Hispanics mostly males mostly it's sort
of you know putting it's essentially
reconstituting something like the
imprisonment system for
African-Americans that was instituted
after the Civil War after the Civil War
there were about 10 years of relative
freedom and then there was a north south
compact which effectively allowed the
South to criminalize black Liv life Wow
and put the population back into jail
that's where they went they became
another slave labor force that went on
till the second world war what do you
think I mean here we have this occupying
movement um I would like to see I know
we don't agree with Ron Paul on every
issue but my goodness as far as foreign
policy I mean he even you know he even
discussed that uh we invaded Iran in
1953 he's talked about the the you know
the foundations as to why they're mad at
us and he was booed off the stage and
I'm worried that last time Fox took him
off uh Fox took him out of the debates
now I heard some other uh some um I
forget what Israeli organiz somebody who
wanted to take him out of a debate and
uh said he had nothing to offer and uh
you know so you still have this
sensorship I mean he he he's been doing
well in the STW pole I mean and he
really right the to I I hope that you
know
I mean I've actually had people write me
and say you know worried that uh he
maybe shouldn't take any small craft or
anything well you know and and you just
in other words they're worry for his
life as far as him really pushing the
line like this and I don't think that
that should be the case there should be
somebody that would pop up right after
him if enough people were saying the
same thing well as I said the the
Pentagon said this actually they said
they hate us because they hate our
policiy I mean somebody running for uh
president I mean actually say a big flap
right now about an American ambassador
in Belgium who pointed out what every
specialist on uh the region knows every
reader of the newspapers all know that
the entire that he talked about Israel's
increasing isolation yeah and he said
it's a result of the kind of policies
they're following that's going to lead
to isolation it'll lead to uh
anger at Israel it's not anti-Semitism
but it'll be called anti-Semitism that's
what they did he came under a huge
attack uh the Obama Administration is
now under Congressional pressure to
withdraw him for daring to say what's a
trism international relations trism W so
I mean we could deal with even ptic came
under attack when he deplored Israel's
increasing isolation which which is of
course case but you can't say it you
it's just there's a catechism that you
have to keep well I hope that some of
these things like like we've talked
about before well even the leading
statement or the um the introduction
statement which is a quote by yours that
we live in Tangled in webs of analist De
see in a highly indoctrinated Society
where Elementary
truths uh are easily buried these are
these are are truths and it's funny
about this this Senate 1867
the media had buried that story and it
seemed to be Unearthed of all by the
Obama Administration there are the ones
that said well we might VTO this and
then it kind of came out more that it
was even there and there was also a good
deal of popular protest I don't know how
much oh yeah that had a factor too but
as far as the media not being able to
ignore it I mean when the president does
something you know when he says
something they can't ignore it as easily
so that's why somebody who uh like Ron
Paul were to get in there um and people
who are are uh um supporters of his like
I mentioned well you know I mean come on
he wants to he wants to stop foreign aid
we have we need to you know I mean kids
are starving and or dying of preventable
causes at the rate of a thousand an hour
at least you know and they're just
discarded every day we can't really I
mean if we were to cut into the military
budget instead of spending more more
than the rest of the world combined we'd
have enough money to save some of these
children and if we and if we you know
legalized uh marijuana that would do
away with some of our inefficiency here
the hemp is it could be used for so many
products and I live in uh in area that
used to be a big in textiles it's just
one closed plant after another cuz all
that went overseas however that land
there even my doctor said he's looked
into it and it's it's perfect for him
and uh that could that could add so much
so I mean here we are we're at this
Tipping Point that's what Edgar Mitchell
said that you know that that you know
we're at a Tipping Point and uh it it's
not clear which way it's going to go but
we are the ones who are going to
determine which way it's going to go and
it's up to us and that's how we did it
to the audience when I was talking we're
really exciting aspect of the Occupy
Movement it's becoming a kind of what
could be a Cutting Edge of mass popular
action which would shift the direction
in which the country is going and
there's not a lot of time to do it
there's not to it there are issues that
are not discussed barely barely even
mentioned in the Press which are the
some of the most important issues in
history for example just just last in
the last month the US Department of
energy came out with the its report on
emissions for 20
the last year that they have data on
emissions spectacular rise the largest
ever in fact the level of em emissions
is now worse than the worst case scenar
scenario uh estimated by the
international commission the ipcc
international Commission of scientists
they gave a range of
possible uh
scenarios some very alarmist some mild
this is worse than the most alarmist
that's just the beginning a couple of
days later the International Energy
Association which is not a radical body
that was formed on the initiative of
Henry kinger all the oil companies are
in it and so on they came out with their
estimate and their conclusion was that
in five years at the current rate it may
be
irreversible and so we're coming to the
point they said where within 5 years the
uh Global emissions which of course are
substantially human created uh will
reach the uh the the danger Point that's
been set two 2° Centigrade uh rise in
temperature that may be the IR
irreversible point we may reach it in 5
years right uh that's pretty serious
yeah and uh at the same time the huge
effort made to increase use of fossil
fuels I mean when you read about it they
they tell you
that China is the main villain and
technically their emissions are slightly
above Ours by now but they also have
what three or four times the
population much more than that but uh so
per capita it's much less but there's
another Point that's barely
discussed uh the emissions in
China are basically coming from much of
it we don't know how much is coming from
Western investment so when Apple
produces your iPhone and foxcom under
hideous working conditions those are
called Chinese emissions but it's us
investment and in fact China is pretty
much an assembly plant for uh the the
advanced industrial countries the ones
on its periphery Japan Taiwan South
Korea uh they have a a positive trade
balance with China because they're
providing the parts in the components
the advanced technology that's being
assembled in China uh we're doing it too
Dell
Apple Motorola you know any number of
companies are producing in China and
those are called Chinese emissions but
it's us Investments same with Europe wow
so if you did a real analysis of this
an honest analysis it would look quite
different the developed countries are
far far more responsible for the
destructive emissions which may be the
end of viable exist we don't know I mean
well that's the thing as far as this uh
those emails and and that uh you know as
far as there's a lot of people who are
trying to refute that it's even
happening I mean the earth warm they're
saying okay it's for we know this but
it's not caused by humans and it's
just I mean some of these people are
going to watch this video so you know
it's kind of like believing in a flat
Earth it's not just you know if there's
some people doing it okay who cares but
what's really significant is that a
couple of years ago the U energy
intensive Industries and the big
business lobbies like the Chamber of
Commerce quite openly announced that
they're initiating a major propaganda
campaign to try to convince people that
this is not a problem and that it that
there uh and that's had an effect you
take a look at polls actually just
another thing that happened last month
is that an international polls came out
uh asking people all over the world
about their attitudes on these things
well almost everywhere people want much
more action on the part of their
governments to do something about it
even in the United States but the United
States is much substantially lower in
concern than other countries uh and the
disbelief in the overwhelming scientific
consensus is uh uh uh disbelief is
higher in considerably higher in the
United States and elsewhere that's a
consequence of the massive business
propaganda campaigns wow they uh so you
know some individuals say it well okay
cares but U when the major business
lobbies and the major energy Industries
are doing it that's serious that's hard
to get out of exactly you know Bev sent
something uh and I should mention when
the media discussed this they present
what they call balance so on one side
are you know overwhelming majority of
scientists on the other side are a
couple of Skeptics and missing entirely
are the much larger group of scientists
who do descent from the consensus
because they think it's not it's not
alarmist enough for example right here
at MIT there's a climate study group
scientists public policy people very
sophisticated people I mean their
analyses are far more alarmist than the
international consensus wow but they're
not part of the debate and and may
others like them there are lots of them
well this thing that that uh Bev posted
I I didn't even get to see it but they
told me about it on the way I guess some
uh young adolescent girl got to speak to
the UN and said you know you're messing
up our world I mean if I'm going to have
kids and this and that this is our world
that you're messing up here you know
they're putting profit over people and
uh you know so out of the you know
here's just this young person who
understands more and and people are just
they're so busy they write me sometimes
they go can you know I understand this
and stuff but I'm so busy just trying to
uh make's meet and a lot of a lot of
what they're busy with too are games on
Facebook there's all these games they
have all these distractions plus
television has so many distractions and
um yeah I think that that's having
actually playing a game now with the
decent survival of our grand the real
game yeah the real game and it's amazing
the way it's it's kind of like Lemmings
walking off a cliff exactly well I'm
hoping that uh we can steer the Lemmings
away
and I'm hoping that the Occupy Movement
gets a little bit involved in elections
I don't I got I bought a I I used to
always think I if I had the right
website I don't know but I had occupy
elections that us which I might do
something with but I really think that
people need to be behind and know that
they've been censoring our elections
that's what I've been documenting since
2000 I hope they don't do it again with
Paul
um what is your he doesn't have a chance
of it you don't you think there's any
business
for he has aot participate a lot of
great I mean he's been doing well in the
straw the straw poles that's irrelevant
if you want to run an American American
elections are bought so far but we could
if we're going to change you could
change it but you need a really mass
movement that's what I'm trying to hope
the the Occupy Movement would well it's
you know it's nowhere near the scale
where it could uh I mean you know I have
course too but if you're thinking about
electoral impact uh it's far from being
able to uh get involved in a three
billion dollar election but if people
understood what we're talking about
today they could they they could we
could if enough of us put forth the
effort and you're saying that we really
probably should keep on keep it on even
if he even if he signs this bill we we
those of us who've been speaking out
should keep on keeping on right yeah
that's undoubtedly true and it has an
impact but if you want to be serious
about elections a couple of things you
have to bear in mind for one thing if
you even if you could elect your own
president you know pick your favorite s
elect him president you got to wouldn't
make any difference well because you
know you need uh you need Senators you
need Representatives you need Governors
you need the investors the you have to
have control over investment decisions
over what happens to Capital I that's a
long St strugle not not it's the right
struggle but you have to recognize but
if you had a president in there he would
have or she would have air timeon number
one and plus I'm saying when I say
occupy elections I mean what I've been
saying all along I've interview
congressional candidates and the Senate
candidates as well because I mean that's
the you know both houses of Congress you
really need to have some people there
who are standing for us who aren't
bought I mean you know wasn't human
right that uh um you know nothing
appears more surprising to those who
consider human affairs with a
philosophical eye than the easiness with
which the many are governed by the few
we still outnumber them they I think
with effort if we recruited enough
effort and if we can certainly be tried
but we shouldn't underestimate the scale
and character of what has to be done
it's a long hard struggle it's putting
somebody in office even if he could do
it which you can't wouldn't change
anything well unless we got people in
those other offices yeah but that's a b
job and it should be done actually
that's one thing the right way
understood uh they began their
organizing with the school boards local
Representatives wow and so on and yeah
that's the way to build up an electoral
movement well let's hope things cook in
the next year I think we're out of time
thanks again huh
