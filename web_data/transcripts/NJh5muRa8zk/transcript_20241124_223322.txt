afternoon welcome to this press
conference the committee on the exercise
of the in inable rights of the
Palestinian people is honored to host uh
within the framework of the
international year of solidarity with
the pal inian people such an important
event as today's with exceptional
guests on behalf of the Palestinian
rights committee I'm very pleased to
welcome Professor n
chsky though I am certain he needs no
introductions Professor chumsky is
undoubtedly one of the most prominent
critical thinkers of our time
his extensive study in work on the
Israeli Palestinian conflict over the
past 40 years uh could not be more
relevant and pertinent than at this
particular
juncture Professor chumsky will deliver
a lecture at 3 p.m. in
the general
assembly in the general assembly Hall uh
previously it was informed to all that
was oset General Assembly Hall on the
prospects for resolving the Israeli
Palestinian conflicts in lights of
recent events his lecture will be
followed by a discussion and Q&A session
with Amy Goodman journalist and host at
democracy Now Professor chumsky will now
first give a short statement after which
we will open the floor for questions
from the media Professor the floor is
yours thank you all very much for coming
I'm very pleased to be here and uh look
forward to uh discussing whatever issues
you have on your mind and would like to
bring up so I'll keep to a very brief
statement
that floor is yours the floor is yours
and uh we can only question questions in
English I regret uh so please keep your
questions brief and to the point and
he'll answer them one by
one please go
ahead uh Professor chsky uh on behalf of
uh the UN correspondent Association
you're welcome and thank you for being
here the Palestinian leadership is
calling now uh uh on the security
Council to adopt a resolution
uh to to end the occupation within a two
years time frame do you think that the
security Council should take such action
thank
you I think the security Council should
take that action and indeed stronger
actions but uh as I need to tell you the
security Council can only act in so far
as the great Powers permit and in this
case that means in so far as the United
States permits
and uh my suspicion is that uh the US
delegation will seek ways to block any
such resolution though I think it's
certainly appropriate the resolution
that
is
please uh thank you uh Professor chumsky
uh
I wonder what moral position would you
take if you were a
Palestinian and you have the choice
under the
occupation and you have the
Islamic uh state that you see nowadays
and the Arab AOG uh uh authoritarian
regimes what is the choice
that you take the moral one the moral
choice for the Palestinians yeah thank
you well the moral choice is to resist
the
occupation uh they have limited
options uh the moral choices cannot be
divorced from uh the con tactical uh
judgments about the consequences of
actions so there's no such thing as
moral choices in a universe divorced
from the one in which we exist and in
the universe in which we exist the U
moral choices are um limited uh but they
are not
non-existent uh for a I've been I've had
uh uh various involvements with the
Palestinian leadership for maybe 45
years and I think uh uh origin initially
through um my friend Edward SED who
close friend arranged meetings we had
discussions and my feeling all along is
that
the
primary uh focus of the Palestinian
leadership uh should be or at least a
primary focus to uh address the American
population as I think there will be no
significant progress ress in this
conflict until pressure from the
American population uh induces the
government to take a different stance
and every uh uh third world nationalist
movement Vietnamese Nicaraguan tares
whatever it
was have all understood the significance
of developing uh solidarity and support
among the American population to the
extent that they can infl influence
modification of policy and I think
that's a a a crucial direction that the
Palestinian efforts should be directed
to quite apart from actions in the
international Arena so for example
yesterday's uh vote in the British
Parliament is an illustration of the
kind of Step that can be taken that can
add to the growing effort to pressure
the the influential states in the world
unfortunately it's not an egalitarian
world the ones who have more influence
to use that influence to advance a
settlement of the uh conflict which is
Within Reach and we pretty well know
what it is gentleman the second row yes
thank you Professor chumsky my name is
Abdul Hamid Sayan from the daily Al
that's based in
London and my question Mr uh
chsky is the two-state solution still
viable do you believe that there is any
chance left for a second state in the
West Bank East Jerusalem in Gaza that is
viable independent Sovereign contigent
and independent truly is there a chance
is there a chance for a two-state
settlement with an independent U viable
Palestinian state yeah there's a chance
and I don't think it's hard to see how
it could be
reached uh it's
come it's come fairly close a number of
times so for example the taba
negotiations in uh January uh
2001 approached a settlement that might
have been viable in fact as you may
recall in the final press conference of
the negotiators Israeli and palestin Ian
they did in inform the press that if
they had a bit more time they might have
actually settled the the remaining
issues there were several outstanding
issues remaining and although U lots
lots has happened since then I don't see
uh any reason to doubt that a settlement
roughly along the lines that they were
discussing could be
implemented uh it will require that as I
said before that U the United States U
be willing to accept such a settlement
so far that hasn't happened I mean as
you know uh just uh three years ago
President Obama vetoed a security
Council resolution his delegation vetoed
a security Council resolution which
called for the implementation of
official US
policy uh as long as that continues to
be the stance I think there will be one
roadblock after
another sure thanks a lot Matthew Lee
Inner City Press on behalf of the free
un Coalition for Access thanks a lot for
this briefing I wanted to ask you know
you obviously the US has a veto in the
security Council as did the other four
and they had a veto in choosing bimon as
the Secretary General and him being re
renewed now that he's in his second term
I wonder how do you just since you're
here at the UN how do you view sort of
the UN secretary at unua the whole kind
of un Machinery on the question of
Palestine how do you do you view it as
as even handed between the two sides or
or is so and the other if you're willing
to go once Beyond Palestine is I'd love
to hear your analysis of the kobani the
situation in kobani in in in Syria with
the Kurds but only if time permits thank
you well the
situation with regard to the UN
leadership one has to always qualify
there's a certain range of options open
to the UN leadership but obviously the
UN cannot proceed beyond the bounds
permitted by the great powers and in
this particular case Israel Palestine
that means primarily the United States
the record of is overwhelming and very
clear for uh 50 almost 50 years uh the
and I think U within those bounds the UN
leadership has done about what it could
I mean you can criticize this or that
judgment but U the limits are fairly
narrow uh as I just mentioned there was
even a US veto of a resolution uh
endorsing official US policy uh that's
pretty extreme and indicates what the
limits are once again with regard to
kobani um it's a shocking situation uh
this morning's
newspaper as you read described the
Turkish military oper operation against
Kurds in Turkey not against
Isis a couple of kilometers across the
border where they're in danger of being
slaughtered uh as long as uh uh I think
the UN something should be done at the
UN at least in terms of a very strong
resolution to uh call for
a ceasefire
it's hard to impose the use of force but
to the extent that it can be done to try
to protect cabani from destruction at
the hands of Isis which could be a major
Massacre with enormous consequences the
Strategic significance of the town in
the Kurdish region is pretty obvious and
the turkey's world is critical in this
if we could try to keep questions to uh
Israel Palestine I'd appreciate that
Madam in the second row
please thank you
Le um do you see a trend in Western
Europe after Sweden and the British
Parliament which doesn't necessarily
commit the UK government toward um
recognizing
Palestine as a state which would very
much isolate the US uh I'm not sure that
and
secondly um do you see the Israeli
criticism deteriorating into
anti-Semitism it doesn't mean that you
have to be an anti-semitic to criticize
Israel the two as we you and I know can
be very separate but do you see that
Trend in Europe and elsewhere and
especially in the Arab
world well the U classic discussion of
this was given by U Israel's un
Ambassador ABA Ean back about in the
must have been around
1970 he has an interesting article which
you might want to look up it appeared in
Congress weekly which is a major journal
of the American Jewish Community the
kind of more liberal segment of the
organized American Jewish community and
in that he essentially gives his
instructions to the American Jewish
community and what he says is you your
task is to convince the population and
the world that any criticism of Israel
is either
anti-Semitism or in the case of Jews uh
is uh as an indication of Jewish
self-hatred and he actually mentioned
two people one was if Stone and the
other was me so I'm was happy to be
designated as a neurotic self-hating Jew
actually there's a history which I
presume ABA Evan knows certainly any
anyone with a Jewish Education knows a
real Jewish Education this goes right
back to the Bible the first person to
use this argument was uh King
Ahab Kings to he was the epitome of evil
in the Bible and Ahab and Jezebel
everyone knows the story uh at one point
he U the king called The Prophet Elijah
to him uh and demanded of the prophet
that he uh he condemned the Prophet
Elijah
as the Hebrew phrase is O
Israel bright translation would be hater
of Israel he asked him why are you a
hater of Israel uh what the prophet was
doing of course was condemning the uh
acts of the evil King and for the
totalitarian
mentality the power center is identified
with the society the
culture the community and so on so if
you condemn the power center you're
condemning the country the nation the
history and the culture so the Prophet
Elijah was a hater of Israel and the
person who issued the condemnation was
the epitome of evil in the Bible so we
have a choice do we want to join Elijah
or do we want to join King Ahab as ABA
Aban
recommended as at the first part of your
question I think the British vote
yesterday was as the Press correctly
pointed out symbolic the conservative
party essentially abstained following
Israel's request that they ignore the
vote uh and uh the Prime Minister
Cameron made it clear stated that this
would not affect British policy however
it does affect British policy uh it's
another indication of the way the
populations in Europe Europe and also in
the United States to an extent not as
far but it's moving in that direction
are um uh want to distance themselves
from the uh actions that Israel is
taking which are very explicitly
criminal actions there's no question
about it they're in violation of direct
orders of the security Council of the
Judgment of the world Court there's no
higher authorities
uh they want to distance themselves from
those actions both their criminality and
their brutality and
our every society in particular more
somewhat more democratic ones like
Britain in the United States uh sooner
or later the uh attitudes of the
population can they may not but they can
influence the direction of policy if
there's effort and engagement in that
direction and what we saw on the case of
Sweden explicitly and uh now tentatively
in England and I there was a comment by
the French foreign minister that they
might be contemplating something like
that in the future I think that's a
direction in which things are going to
go uh as you know there are already I
think uh over 130 countries that do
recognize
Palestine uh Sweden is the first one in
Europe and
uh there will be
uh great efforts to prevent this on the
part
of the United States and its close
allies uh if you look over the
international scene the strongest
support for Israeli policies has been uh
what's called the
anglosphere Britain's the offshoots of
Britain the United States Canada
Australia uh and I think that's where
the resistance will remain but
U they can't divorce themselves in the
world if there's more moves in this
direction in Europe it will strengthen
efforts in the United States to pressure
the US government to join the world on
this issue uh and U that can have an
impact can I ask everybody to silence
their phones please uh can we have the
gentleman Nar AB of almadin television
in Beirut Mr Trump I'm from almadin
television in Beirut Mr jsky uh you said
a few years ago that democracy is
forbidden in the Middle East and it's
forbidden by the United States this was
your statement in 2011 do you still
believe like that and how do you
envisage the future of the area after
the emergence of Isis isil anra and
their
Affiliates well we have a good
indication of um what the US attitude is
towards
democracy many examples so for example
there was the most dramatic is the one
truly free election that took place in
the Arab world they elections but
they're always constrained in one or
another way there was a very free
election carefully monitored uh declared
to be free and fair in January 2006 in
Palestine how did the US respond by
immediately moving to punish the
Palestinian Ian for voting the wrong way
in a free election the us immediately
began to organize a military coup to try
to overthrow the government uh was
preempted in 2007 that led to the
Takeover Hamas and Gaza that was the
immediate reaction to the first free and
open democratic election it's not the
only case uh free elections
are uh everyone calls for democracy
Stalin called for democracy everyone
loves democracy but only when it comes
out the way we want it to and uh and
that's demonstrated over and over uh
don't want to say it's an iron law but
the tendency is
overwhelming the lady in the red
please I didn't get to the Isis Point
yeah okay well come back I think it's
very hard to predict Isis is a I mean
there is a background uh the uh recently
uh Paul parar one of CIA long background
in the CIA mostly on the Middle East uh
leading specialist uh stated the United
States created Isis Graham Fuller also
long background in the
CIA leading analyst of Middle East
policies recently had an article
headlined the United States created Isis
both of them said look we didn't us
didn't actually create it it simply
created the conditions from which it
arose when uh the fragile Society of
Iraq fragile for all kind of reasons we
can go in but when that Society was hit
by a sledgehammer and smashed to Pieces
uh lots of very unpleasant and ugly
consequences of
quite apart from the destruction the
killings the Exiles and so on one of
them was inciting sectarian conflict uh
previously it had been pretty subdued so
Baghdad was a mixed City people lived
all over and often people didn't even
know whether their neighbor was Shiite
or Sunni like you don't know if your
neighbor is one or another branch of
protestant let's say uh within a short
time after the invasion us British
Invasion uh the uh which immediately
imposed sectarian divisions uh sectarian
conflicts began to arise uh out of this
they're not they're tearing Iraq to
shreds they're tearing the regions to
shreds an extremist Fringe developed
Isis uh which is an extremist branch of
the most extreme fundamentalist branch
of Islam Sai wahhabi salafi Doctrine or
already extremist this one an extremist
branch of it its uh military victories
are quite
startling hard to think of anything like
it I mean the Iraqi Army is 350,000 men
it's an army that has fought bitter Wars
um the case of Iran a serious War went
on for years well-trained
Army willing to stand up for nationalist
struggle
armed heavily armed trained by the
United States for over a decade as soon
as a couple of thousand lightly armed
Jihadi appears the generals ran away and
the soldiers had to flee after them
whole Army collapsed uh what's that's
pretty unusual event in history the
pesmerga the Kurdish militia was able
partly to hold off Isis but Pro
apparently the main fighting
we don't have a lot of evidence but it
appears that the main fighting is
probably being done by the
pkk the um the Kurdish U Turkish based
actually based in Northern Iraq Mount
condle but Kurdish
Turkish background Kurdish forces the
ones that turkey attacked
yesterday yeah vice president sorry just
for a quick follow up vice president
first accused the Allies the gulf allies
of conniving with
Isis Vice President Biden us Vice
President Joe Biden he accused the
Allies yes he accused the allies of
conniving or helping Isis and then he
apologized how he didn't actually say
they were allied with Isis he said what
he said was accurate he said they leave
the Border open they leave is they leave
the opportunity for Isis to strengthen
itself he did but turkey says the same
thing we would like to give everybody a
chance what they say is they will not uh
not they will not focus on Isis unless
it also strikes at their enemies their
enemies are first of all the Assad
regime and secondly the
Kurdish the pkk and the um Kurdish
linked Kurdish groups in Syria which
they don't want to expand and gain
autonomy I mean Eran virtually says it
directly that Biden almost didn't have
to say it and the actions demonstrated
once we give everybody a chance we can
have some time for followup go ahead
please Professor jsk it's very very uh
wonderful to have you here again do you
see any connection between US policy
toward
Palestine and uh US policies elsewhere
in the globe um any similarity of
Interest tendency you also said uh that
the US population would have to exert
pressure on the government but in one of
your writings you spoke of the uh the
media's acceptable spectrum of
dissent and since the media uh appears
to be the mainstream media very largely
in support of whatever the US policy
is how would the information get to the
American people so that they could have
an impact on the government
well to begin with the second point and
remind me if I forget the first uh
because an import it's important uh that
what you just described is true of every
issue it was true of U the war in
Vietnam it was true of the Central
American wars it was true of South
Africa it was true of the tear struggle
I was involved in for many years you
pick it it's always the same the media
pretty much Hue to the government
line little pushing stretching here and
there but it's pretty overwhelming so
take say Vietnam uh which finally
ultimately became a major popular
movement which did influence policy how
did it begin I can tell you I was
involved in the early
1960s I started trying to give talks
about Vietnam actually I live in Boston
which is probably the most liberal city
in the country the University's
academics professional
I would give talks in U somebody's
living room or or in a church with maybe
four people uh we'd have to if we tried
to talk about it we'd have to bring in
half a dozen other issues to try to get
a small group of people to show up uh by
1965 October
1965 the
anti-war activists decided to join in
the first International Day of protest
October 15
1965 was called as an international day
of protest against the war in Vietnam
there were big demonstrations all over
the world we decided to try to have a
demonstration in Boston on the Boston
Common that's the standard place for
public meetings and so on uh it was
broken up violently I was supposed to be
one of the speakers nobody could hear
any of the speakers the only reason we
weren't killed was there were lots of
State Police around who didn't like what
we were saying but didn't want legit on
the Boston comment you take a look at
the Boston Globe the next day the
leading liberal newspaper in the country
bitter denunciation of the demonstrators
how dare these unpatriotic demonstrators
say let's not bomb North Vietnam and so
on Congress the same liberal Congressman
Mike Mansfield others same
denunciations uh the next International
Day of protest was in March
1966 we realized we couldn't have a
public open protest so we organized it
in a church church was attacked 10 cans
tomatoes that and you have to remember
what was happening then in 1966 there
were a quarter of a million almost
300,000 American troops in South Vietnam
South Vietnam had been practically
destroyed by then and the war was
expanding to North Vietnam and though it
wasn't known then into Cambodia and LA
and at that point it was still the it
was almost impossible to have a public
protest without violence well a couple
years later things have changed and the
same is true in every other issue
actually I testified at the United
Nations on East teamour in
1978 uh the Press wouldn't even come
they didn't want to hear about it the US
was providing all of almost all of the
arms to Indonesia for a huge Massacre
virtually genocide Idol but the Press
just wasn't interested and who cares you
know but finally it got out you know
there was significant pressure or
something happened it can be the same
this way on the first issue US policy is
like that of every other great power
there are what are called national
interests they have nothing to do with
the nation they have to do with centers
of power within the nation so the
national interest is is not to protect
the population it's easy to demonstrate
that I won't go through the details but
policy is designed for the to protect
and expand state power and the power of
concentrated the the domestic
concentration of powers in the United
States that's mostly the corporate
sector various sectors of it and
policies designed for that end well you
look at the history of US Israel
relations and it conforms pretty well to
that it's
1948 uh the U Pentagon The Joint Chief
of Staff military were quite impressed
by Israel's military
victories uh and they described Israel
as potentially a significant US base in
the Middle East in fact they described
it Israel as the second largest military
force after turkey n NATO member and a
potential valued Ally um the
very significant to the the most
significant issue to the United States
is the oil reserves of the region they
were regarded as a stupendous source of
strategic power greatest material prize
in world history mostly in Saudi Arabia
also in the Emirates but the a lot of
documents have been released Saudi
Arabia made it pretty clear that they
were not going to object to us support
for uh for Israel they had their own
reasons which we could go into uh but uh
uh and so it continued I it was not a it
was a not a very intimate relationship
and there were conflicts like in 56 but
in
1958 when there was a real problem for
the US and Britain in the Middle East
what happened is that in Iraq uh the U
you the British
run government was overthrown by a
military coup that was the first great
in the anglo-american condominium over
Middle East oil and that was taken very
seriously the US sent troops to Lebanon
they were apparently armed with nuclear
weapons uh they were uh the British sent
trps Jordan it was quite a major
reaction to that Israel was the only
state that cooperated with the United
States you look at the internal us
records which are Declassified they
recognized that Israel was the one
Cooperative state in fact the CIA came
out with an analysis in 58 saying that U
support for Israel is a logical
corollary of our opposition to what they
call radical Arab nationalism radical
means independent uh that was the Real
Enemy by then it was in Nar Egypt uh
1967 it was a major change Israel
performed a huge service to the United
States enormous
and the US policy toward Israel totally
changed and reached its pretty much its
present State what happened if you look
back was there was a major conflict
between two forces in the Arab world uh
radical Islamic fundamentalism based in
Saudi Arabia and secular nationalism
based in Egypt uh during Britain's
dominance of the region it had generally
supported radical Islamic fundamental
ISM and the US took that over for good
reasons the Real Enemy secular
nationalism they don't mind radical
fundamentalism uh and uh there was a war
going on in in Yemen between Saudi
Arabia and Egypt uh Israel pretty much
smashed secular nationalism it was a
tremendous gift both to Saudi Arabia and
to the United States and it solidified a
relationship that
was already reasonably friendly and
created essentially the current
situation I there's no time to run
through the rest of the record but it's
essentially like that actually we saw an
interesting illustration of it just a
couple of weeks ago you remember in the
midst of operation protective Edge when
Israel was smashing Gaza the attack was
so extreme they were beginning to run
out of Amun of
Munitions it's a very heavily armed
country so they appealed to the United
States for more Munitions and Munitions
were in fact transferred to Israel by
the Pentagon in the middle of the
fighting they were transferred from
stocks that the United States
prepositions in Israel for use by US
forces that's one of innumerable
indications of the nature of the
alliance and there's much more like this
one of the most interesting U leaks from
Wikileaks which didn't get the attention
it should have was a list of Highly
significant strategic locations so
significant for the US that we have to
protect them at all costs one of them
was right outside hia Raphael military
Industries which is a major Advanced
military industrial installation one of
the places where they pioneered drone
technology for example so closely linked
to the United States that Raphael
actually transferred its business
operations to Washington where the money
is very tight linkages uh same with
capital flows and many other things uh
so the United States is pursuing the
interest you'd expect of a great power I
on the other hand what do the
Palestinians offer the United States
they're weak they're powerless they have
no wealth they have only the most taid
support from the our rulers you know
they have to make some gestures of
support to quiet their own populations
but nothing real so no power no wealth
therefore no rights those are we may not
like it but uh those are the laws of
international relations uh the gentleman
in the check shirt and then we have time
for only one or two more please hi
professor chsky my name is Sheran BRP
South African broadcasting uh I wonder
if you're aware of the passing on Sunday
of the Kenyan African intellectual Ali
mazri who uh taught in Upstate New York
you you were on the uh foreign policy
top 100 Global thinkers list in 2005 and
he shared similar strands to your
thinking on on the Arab uh the the
Palestinian Israeli conflict I wonder if
you could share a few thoughts on the
occasion of his passing if if I could
comment on his on his passing and and
your your experiences with him just died
few days ago on Sunday yeah very
important intellectual I mean I would
like to answer your question but before
do doing it I would want to look back
and read carefully because it's memories
I don't like to talk about but he wrote
very influential and important work on
this and other issues antic Colonial
issues please ma'am in the green um hi
my name Isam aam I'm from Al Arab jid
newspaper my question is regarding BDS
and your position on BDS and the
especially in America and the fact that
they talking about mainly about
institutions and cultural and academic
by thank
you well BDS is a it's not a principle
it's a tactic it's a collection of
tactics uh anyone who's involved in any
form of activism it is second nature to
ask a simple question about tactics are
they going to work that's the question
you ask about tactics what are you
trying to achieve and is a particular
choice of tactics likely to succeed or
is a choice choice of tactics likely to
backfire which can happen so for example
take Vietnam again um at the peak of
popular
opposition around 1970 a lot of young
people in the United States were so
angry and desperate that they wanted to
do something really extreme and not just
try to um Carry Out educational programs
or influence Congress or support
resistance or whatever but to March down
Main Street and to smash up s wither
men that was a tactic the Vietnamese
were strongly opposed to it because they
could understand something that tactic
is going to alienate the population and
is going to lead to increasing support
for violence and Terror so that's the
wrong tactic you can understand the
motivation but that doesn't make it the
right tactic and that that's General the
BDS movement unfortunately has failed
failed to understand this
lesson adequately other movements have
these are sensible tactics if they are
selected in such a way as to have uh a
positive effect not a negative effect
now first of all it's not BDS it's BD
sanctions come from States and we have
not reached the point
in Palestinian solidarity where states
are taking actions uh the one major
exception to this and it's an important
one partial exception is the European
Union
directive uh to break relations with u
institutions engag involved in the
occupied
territories that's significant if
implemented uh the U Presbyterian Church
in the United States took a similar
resolution that's boycott and investment
and crucially it was aimed also at us
multinationals that are involved in the
occupation and that's
significant uh where BD type actions are
taken to make life uncomfortable for
Israelis they may have some value but
it's not really where the core of the
problem lies they have to change US
policy and it's possible and if you look
at the take a look at the B instantly
these actions were going on before the
BDS movement was formed so these are
tactics that many of us have been using
for years uh the BDS movement itself has
three
principles um they VAR little in
formulation but basically uh sanction
and boycott boycott BDS actions against
Israel as long as it maintains the
control of the occupied territories
that's the first the second is uh as
long as there is discrimin ation against
Palestinians within Israel the third is
until Israel allows the refugees to
return all right now if you're an
activist you ask yourself one question
which of these tactic what is the effect
going to be of these tactics and the
answer is transparent it's transparent
in advance and it's transparent from
looking at the record uh actions
directed against the occupation have
been
successful affected
successful also targeting European and
US
institutions understandable and have the
very positive effect of opening up
discussion and debate in the Western
countries so that people come to
understand what they're involved in all
of that's important you take a look at
actions concerned with the
refugees Zero Effect if it ever if
anything's ever brought up it usually
has a negative effect because it leads
to a backlash saying you're trying to
destroy Israel the groundwork no
groundwork has been laid for it in the
middle case U
repression uh against Palestinians
inside Israel which does exist I've been
writing about it for years it's serious
but it raises a question why not boycott
the United States okay serious you take
a look at African-American history in
the United States I won't go through it
but it's grotesque
uh 500 years and there maybe uh since
the first slaves came and a couple of
decades literally when there was a more
or less opportunity for freedom and this
isn't one of them uh raises that
question well maybe there are answers to
that question but you have to lay the
groundwork for it in educational and
organizational activities and that
hasn't been done the result is that
actions of that kind have usually led to
a backl Clash which is harmful to the
Palestinians these are the kinds of
questions you have to ask about tactics
all the time as I said it's second
nature in activist groups you don't just
say look I I like this it makes me feel
good it's right in principle somehow you
have to ask what's the impact on the
victims that's the question you
constantly have to ask and that should
be the guiding principle you can have
debate and discussion about it but that
should be the guideline thank you
Professor okay I think we just have time
for one more question I'm very sorry but
there will be a Q&A at the end of the
other session um please in the check
shirt sorry gentleman behind you thank
you very much U I'm Christopher renberg
with the Norwegian newspaper ofon Poston
thanks for taking my question um you
were talking about why the US uh behaves
the way it does towards Israel um now
that the US is becoming more and more
self-reliant on oil and other fossil
fuels how can that change the
geopolitics of the region and in
particular the US Behavior towards
Israel I don't think it'll change it at
all pleas give a chance to that please
please go ahead and then we'll wrap it
up
yeah hello um I'm Anna from Armenia
first of all Professor chsky I wanted to
thank you for your brilliant
contribution to science and for your
unyielding political activism we admire
you in my country Armenia very much for
that you were not afraid to raise your
voice even risking being unpopular and I
think you became even more popular after
that my question is this there were some
reports about genocidal massacres in
Middle East and also in Iraq and Syria
towards Kurds and yazidis and speaking
of genocidal issues I can't but remember
uh first genocide of 20th century
Armenian genocide in 1915 when the term
itself genocide by Raphael Lin was used
first when it was created when he
referred to Armenian Genocide being
deeply shaken by that next year we will
mark 100 years since this horrible event
happened what's your stand about this
thank you very
much uh well let me first talk about the
oil um I don't my brief answer I don't
think it'll have any effect at all and
we have good reasons to assume that uh
in the
1950s the United States was the major
oil producer in the world didn't use
Middle East oil it was exporting oil
policies are exact the same uh and if
you look through the record uh say take
when Alaska oil came on stream finally
after the rise in oil prices in the
early 70s which the US was not opposed
to incidentally because uh us
corporations gained us producers gained
the Alaskan oil mostly went to Asia um
you take a look at the Keystone XL
pipeline the big excitement now if it's
built the oil that goes to the Louisiana
refineries are probably going to go
somewhere else not to the United States
uh the issue all along has not been
accessed it's been controlled and that's
quite different if the US was uh running
100% on solar energy I think it would
have the same policies towards the
Middle East you want to it's it's a very
powerful instrument of control to have
your hand on the spet and that's been
understood so you go back 1950 roughly
uh George Kennan leading creator of the
modern international political system he
explained internally that uh if the
United States controls Middle East oil
it will have veto power over Japanese
actions because it'll control Japan's
energy resources it come right up to the
present as B of brinsky one of the main
planners U he was kind of kind of
critical about the invasion of Iraq but
he nevertheless said that a good side of
it would be that uh if it worked and the
us could control Iraqi oil which didn't
need it would have critical leverage
over its European allies allies means
potential enemies they got to keep them
under control that's great power
politics and all the way through that's
been true it's still a huge resource
huge potential resource and control over
it and where it goes is a significant
instrument in world
affairs uh so I personally don't think
that the in you know the US is now
becoming again a major exporter which is
a disaster for the world um we should
not forget that we are really playing
with fire every drop of oil that's
extracted from the ground is another
blow in the coffin of the human species
we're coming pretty close to a precipice
where we're going to destroy the uh
conditions for decent existence and
unless most of that oil stays in the
ground where it has to be uh the future
for our grandchildren is not very bright
this is constantly neglected when you
read the Euphoria about uh uh the
fracking and so on you read the business
Press today they're very excited because
the price of gasoline is going to go
down in the United States
that's a
catastrophe for the price of gasoline to
go down is an utter catastrophe not a
time for Euphoria at least if you can
think Beyond you know how many
Commodities you can buy tomorrow if you
think about say you're the world your
grandchildren live in this is just
obvious but
unfortunately it's not the driving force
and policy uh anyhow to get back to the
explicit question I don't think that
there'll be an impact on policy because
the issue has always been control not
access and what is your opinion on the
genocide of arm which was the first in
20th century well actually I was in
Turkey um about a year ago to give the U
Memorial lecture for rtin the Turk
Turkish Armenian journalist who exposed
the Armenian massacr and it's U I mean
it was a huge atrocity no question about
that a very complex one so the first
time I was in Turkey for example was
around 2000 and I was there to support
Kurdish rights I was there for trial and
so on and among other the things I went
to
jure were Kurdish the Kurds had just
been subjected to really horrible
atrocities in Turkey right through the
90s it was awful and this was kind of
the tail end of it and I was taken in
jarak here by Kurdish friends too I
asked to visit the The Armenian quarter
deaker was the place where the final
massacres took place mostly by
Kurds I mean
the the internal psychological conflicts
are hard to describe um they themselves
were just barely emerging from major
Slaughters incidentally backed by the
United States which provided about 80%
of the arms and here they were being I
was asking them to show me the remnants
of a massacre in which they were among
the major perpetrators the
final almost I hate to use the words but
almost a final solution for the
Armenians in in Turkey well they took me
there was an old church one Church
falling apart no roof you know pieces
total wreck but remnants of the building
were there I asked if U anyone had
collected the relics and they were
uncomfortable about it but they took me
to a little store nearby small store
where there was an Armenian man roughly
my age Who U had U collected relics from
the church and that was about the
remnants of the Armenian community in
jarak here I mean
Armenian I was there last year for the
FR think lecture very substantial change
the church had been rebuilt
reconstituted uh there's at the htin
memorial there were probably hundreds of
thousands of people demonstrating big
March through
Istanbul
supporting bringing up the truth about
the Armenian massacres the police didn't
interfere was too big a too big a
demonstration to interfere with um the
final it ended at the uh publishing
house where harink worked and where he
was assassinated and uh his wife his
widow was was there I was there and
there was a big crowd talks and so on
it's an enormous change and a positive
one so we should it was a terrible
atrocity but there's now the beginnings
of coming to terms with it it's not easy
uh other countries have similar problems
I mentioned before that the support for
Israel is primarily from the
anglosphere think about the anglosphere
for a minute what makes those countries
similar the United States Australia and
Canada these are settler Colonial
societies societies where the English
colonists came and virtually
exterminated the indigenous population
all of them not everybody but horrible
atrocities have we come to terms why
would this might this be related to
support for Israel well I don't think
it's hard to figure out especially when
you recognize that these are extremely
religious societ societies with extreme
fundamentalist religious Elements which
take a literalist interpretation of the
Bible you put all that together and it's
a cultural fact over and above the
geopolitical facts that lie behind this
have these societies come to terms with
their extermination of the indigenous
population it's a long time hasn't
happened have they come to terms with
the leg y of slavery which is still
alive remember you look at look at the
number of black males in
prison that's the legacy of slavery 500
years have they come to terms with it no
turkey is beginning to come to terms
with a major crime and I think that
should be applauded and supported but
without taking a superior stance there
are very few countries that don't have
something to look back on thank you very
much sir on that uh we do have the
session in the General Assembly Hall uh
would like to invite you to the general
assembly thank
you
for
