it's been said known Chomsky is one of
the most sighted authors in history up
there with Shakespeare and the Bible
even and his work covers a huge range
take his latest book it's called
illegitimate Authority a collection of
interviews on subjects as varied as Joe
Biden climate change abortion rights in
the United States the economic Fallout
from covid-19 the war in Ukraine
Vladimir Putin Xi Jinping a much more
besides known welcome to times radio
thanks for joining us
thank you and don't take too seriously
the output of PR word
now listen I want to talk to you first
of all about
um how you are described if you're
filling in a form what's your occupation
do you write down public intellectual as
other people might expect what's your
what's your job
I teach
I'm a university Professor right
teach
courses on
Linguistics cognitive science philosophy
social and political issues
and like any other academic
do you like being thought of a public
intellectual or is is the idea of a
public intellectual a sort of
old-fashioned thing in a world where
everyone can pump out their opinions in
public all the time
well I never took the concept public
intellectual or seriously and I don't
take it very seriously now people like
me who and you who have a relative
amount of privilege or
able to
enter the public domain with our
thoughts and opinions they may be of
some value maybe not
maybe they guy who's cleaning the street
outside has better opinions but not the
privilege
um the start of the book the preface of
your book says we live in dangerous and
disconcerting times I wonder whether you
think now is a more
dangerous and disconcerting time that
when you you first came to prominence
back in the 60s with the Vietnam War the
Cold War how does the times we live in
today
compared to the other times that you've
lived through and written about
far more dangerous
there's actually a pretty
simple
straightforward measure of the danger
not perfect but as good as simple
measures we have that's the Doomsday
Clock
uh the analysts gave up minutes during
the Trump years moved to seconds to
midnight Midnight's termination now I
moved it to 90 seconds to midnight it's
never been anywhere near that and there
are good reasons for it we're first of
all the danger of nuclear war is
increasing no question about that but we
are racing towards a precipice of
environmental destruction
of a couple of decades in which we could
mitigate or control it but we're racing
in the opposite direction
nothing could be more dangerous than
that that means reaching
irreversible tipping points at which
stage
just that it declined to the destruction
of human life on Earth
we've never faced that before actually
we've been facing it in a way since
August 6 1945 that never at this level
of danger
it's interesting I was going to ask you
the
if you if we are on that path I suppose
some people would say we've been on that
path for a long time and even the
warning of getting closer to that point
doesn't seem to make
politicians leaders of any country of
any political persuasion seem to be
grasped by the moment as you do do you
know when you when you talk that it
sounds apocalyptic and yet you know we
spend our time talking about trivial
things
well the things
like
Ukraine war the Yemen War
destruction of Iraq
going on still these are all very
serious things many more but it's true
that there's a background issues
creeping up on us and very little is
being done about it
are the
maybe something is Goldman Sachs
study of China they claim that China is
going to looks as if it's going to reach
its uh goals of
Net Zero fossil fuels much earlier than
was expected so maybe that's a good sign
but
most of us are going completely in the
wrong direction last year fossil fuel
production increased the United States
is which is
right now the leading fossil fuel
producers expanding with new fields
opening up federal lands for exploration
for decades and the fossil fuel
companies are euphoric with the
prospects for
increased public support for their uh
Enterprise of destroying life on Earth
so
doesn't look good
you mentioned the uh the war in Ukraine
let's turn our attention to that
um certainly in in the UK the left
actually under people like Jeremy Corby
had argued that it wasn't Russia that
was the enemy it was the U.S that was
destabilized in the world and then
Russia invades a sovereign Democratic
country right on its on its border
starting a conflict which is claimed
tens of thousands of innocent lives
does that not make clear that who the
real threat to the world is it's not the
us as the left is has argued for a long
time it's it's Vladimir Putin's Russia
well the invasion of Ukraine is
plainly a war crime
and put it in you can't put it in the
same category as greater war crimes but
it's a major one
according to the uh
official
uh the only evidence that we have solid
evidence is
the United Nations estimates uh Pentagon
estimates and so on they estimate about
8 000 civilians killed that's a lot of
people
but the United States and Britain do
overnight it's uh presumably it's an
underestimate so let's say it's twice
that much that would put it at the level
of the U.S backed Invasion Israeli
invasion of Lebanon it's killed about
maybe twenty thousand people suppose
it's off by a factor of 10. that is the
casualty rate is really ten times as
high as this claimed well that would put
it in the category of Ronald Reagan's
terrorist atrocities in El Salvador
roughly a new order of 80 000. so it's
here of course Iraq is just another
dimension so it's serious it's a
terrible crime uh you can understand why
the global South does not take very
seriously the
eloquent uh
protestations of Western countries about
this unique episode in history they've
been victims of far more maybe the
Russians will go on to air level maybe
maybe they go on to you may recall how
many people visited Baghdad well the
United States and Britain were
pulverizing it nobody visited Baghdad in
fact anyone there U.N inspectors and
peace activists were taken out of the
country because it was too dangerous
when the U.S and Britain go to war no
foreign leaders feeling visiting it like
I presume Russia could up the ADI and
move on to the U.S British style war
maybe they could even go to the point of
commemorating atrocities like Mario Paul
with uh the way the United States is now
commemorating it's uh some of its worst
atrocities in Iraq like one of the worst
atrocities was the marine assault on
Fallujah
beautiful city one of the most beautiful
and Iraq destroyed
unknown numbers of people killed but the
the people still dying from the weapons
that were used uh the United States Navy
just commitment just commissioned its
latest worship the USS Fallujah in honor
of the Marine assault which carried out
one of the worst atrocities in Iraq well
maybe the Russians will get to that
point too someday it's interesting now
Donald Trump's game we hear the same
thing from from the left here in the UK
it sounds something that was left these
are just what it is certainly from from
left-wing politics in the UK this is
trying to create equivalence they're at
anti-west position
um
you're doing equivalence you are drawing
equivalence you're saying that you've
just you've literally just drawn
equivalence with with the number of
deaths in various places I've
explain to people listening to this why
what you're not saying is because Ronald
Reagan did this or George Bush did that
that doesn't make what Vladimir Putin's
done all right does it I said it's a
major crime but there's no equivalence
that
following the party line
like gave figures no equivalence maybe
the casualty toll is 10 times as high as
is estimated well that would make it
like Reagan's crimes in El Salvador
it's not equivalent
but I suppose some people listening to
this will think you're seeking to excuse
what no okay that is the fabrication of
the right wing I am not seeking to
excuse anything I said it's a terrible
War crime that's not excusing anything
I'm talking about the extreme hypocrisy
of claims about how this is the worst
thing that ever happened when it's a
fraction of what we do all the time
that's why the global South is watching
with ridicule as a pompous Western
commentators try to lecture them on why
don't you join us in opposing this
terrible crime so a leader gets up and
says how can you not join us when a
country is attacking another country uh
they laugh and ridicule that's what
you've been doing to us forever
do you think Britain's complicit in that
in the same way or is it specifically an
American problem
one
is do you think that Britain is
complicit in the same way or is it
specifically an America problem
did Britain take part in the invasion of
Iraq did Britain take part in fact
a leading rule in the destruction of
Libya yes Britain is within complicit is
Britain sending arms to Saudi Arabia to
implement the worst humanitarian crisis
in the world in Yemen of course
couldn't go on in Italy
I'd stand out not in the past
I want to take you back to something you
said in August 2020 you said that uh
there was a Russian red line for 30
years we'll tolerate your violation of
flight firm pledge not to move NATO to
our borders
uh but it comes with uh you were talking
about the idea of Ukraine going into
NATO would be a red line
actually what we've seen as a result of
Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is
Nate is Ukraine becoming much closer to
the West Finland and Swindon Sweden
Finland and Sweden are now joining NATO
as a result of what Vladimir Putin has
been doing do you think Vladimir Putin
miscalculated that he drew red lines
thinking that they would never be
crossed
well first of all the talk about a red
line you miss a derivative it's not me
it's virtually the entire U.S Diplomatic
Corps
current head of the CIA past heads uh
the defense secretary halcus defense
secretary of uh Bush
William Perry defense secretary of
Clinton
they're the ones who've been saying that
this is a red line don't attribute it to
me I'm quoting that yeah
it's almost the entire top of the
political policy class and Diplomatic
Corps who knew anything but Russia have
been arguing for 30 years that it is
reckless and dangerous to tried to cross
what there's a red line for every
Russian leader Yeltsin Gorbachev
everyone
allowing Ukraine and Georgia to enter
NATO that's been clear for 30 years uh
so uh did Putin make a mistake of course
not only Not only was it a criminal act
of aggression but it was an act of
criminal stupidity
uh he's driven Europe into
Washington's control
it's a gift to the United States on a
silver platter
uh Finland and Sweden is
a different issue they have absolutely
no reason to join NATO and they know it
perfectly well their reason for joining
NATO is they have advanced military
systems they've been pretty well
integrated into NATO operations for many
years joining NATO officially opens up
new markets for their in for their
military industry a new potential for
obtaining Advanced Equipment and so on
there hasn't ever been and they know it
the slightest threat to Sweden or
Finland from Russia what we have but why
not when when when you know we were told
that we were told months before Russia
invaded Ukraine there was no Prospect to
them invading Ukraine repeatedly by
Russia
Russia said that they were not going to
invade Ukraine and then they did why why
wouldn't if you were if you were Finland
or Sweden why wouldn't you join NATO for
30 years not only Russia every leader
but every top official in the United
States with any interest in it that NATO
that wrote that that if Ukraine moves
towards uh entering NATO it
and no Russian leader would ever accept
it remember that Biden take a look at
what happened in 2021 and
2012 we have a record
the Biden Administration offered an
enhanced program to Ukraine enhanced
program for NATO uh uh for entering NATO
it increased weapons applies
interoperability of weapons of the
attacks and on this continued this does
not justify The Invasion but it's a
background up until February 2022 Russia
was still saying why don't we try them
if you will consider or security
concerns we can have a negotiation we
can have a negotiated settlement that's
flatly rejected gets worse last March
there were negotiations between Ukraine
and Russia under Turkish auspices what
did Britain do
prime minister Boris Johnson flew to
Ukraine and fought with kids that
Britain and the United States don't
think this is a time for negotiations
it was followed by Lloyd Austin
secretary of defense for the United
States who presumably gave his typical
message extreme clear we have to
continue the war to severely weaken
Russia well the negotiations collapsed
we don't know why Western media don't
cover these things we only know mainly
from Ukrainian sources for the Western
media like your Journal you don't cover
peace new possibilities you cover War
but those are all the facts we know well
does that justify the criminal attack
you know
is it an act of criminal stupidity yes
and yet it does sound a bit like you are
explaining it because why can't Ukraine
join NATO they're an independent
sovereign country why can't they join
NATO
what would happen if Mexico decided to
join a Chinese run International
military alliance with uh sending heavy
weapons to Mexico and the United States
interoperability of Chinese and Mexican
military systems what would happen in
Mexico
it'd be blown away
you know that
so you'll then drawing comparisons
between NATO and China and Russia you
you see that an equivalence between I
don't NATO is a much more aggressive
Alliance
NATO has invaded uh Yugoslavia invaded
Libya invaded Ukraine backed up the
invasion of Ukraine backed up the
invasion of Afghanistan
it's an aggressive military diet
everybody outside the West in the west
were not allowed to think it because
we're deeply controlled by adherence to
the party line but everybody else can
see this
so what do you think the purpose is then
you think that what the Ukraine if NATO
if Ukraine were to join NATO that this
would form the basis of NATO invading
Russia
well if China put military bases in
Mexico it wouldn't be a sign for China
invading the United States but the
United States had tolerated for 36. you
know that very well
but so it sounds to me like you are
justifying the Russian invasion of
Ukraine you're saying the very Act of
the very Act of wanting to enter NATO is
grounds for Russia feeling sufficiently
threatened to then invade Ukraine
the western party line which Western
intellectuals are instructed to adhere
to uh rigorously says that if you tell
the facts that's justifying Russia no
it's not justifying Russia there's not
even an end of that not even a remote
hint it's saying here are the facts that
we should face that's the fact if you
get out of the little Western propaganda
bubble move to the global South
everybody says this
okay let me put let me put something to
you did the
and we've seen it in certainly in
British Politics the the anti-west left
as I would describe them in the UK where
a position of being uh anti-british
imperialism anti-American imperialism
big are being so anti-west essentially
LED you to an alliance with Vladimir
Putin it was a new type of Russian
leader and it was all hunky-dory up
until the points he invades Ukraine and
now you're trying to you're essentially
trying to justify it by the back door
that he's he's he's let you down
Vladimir Putin will you please stop
reiterating the western party line and
listen to what I'm saying there's not a
word of justification there's no
anti-worth I know you keep saying that
and then you keep making a justification
it was because of NATO was because of
Afghanistan it was because of uh Libya
oh all right Sonata justification listen
to the words okay there is nothing to
justify the Russian invasion of Ukraine
there is nothing to justify the Russian
invasion of Ukraine understand yep but
we can ask why is the global South
collapsing and ridicule when it hears
the kinds of things that you're talking
about Good Reasons
when you say the globe but you've used
the phrase a couple of times explain
what you mean by the global South
India Indonesia South Africa Brazil
um
does Colombia do you want me to list
them they're not lining up with Vladimir
Putin though are they
no they're not lining up with Vladimir
Putin that's your reiteration of the
western party line they're taking a
neutral position what they're saying is
this they regard this as a proxy war
between Russia and the United States
over Ukrainian bodies they're saying we
don't want to take part in it that's not
pro-putin
that's the western party line we should
be able to escape the Western propaganda
bubble and simply look at the facts
let's zoom out a bit more then just
finding where we talk about politics how
do countries like Britain and America
break away from the as you put it
western party line uh Jeremy corbyn I
think just agreed with you on lots of
things actually in in politics he he
went to the country twice and he lost
twice it turns out the country did not
want Jeremy corbyn to be prime minister
well you know perfectly well that that's
not what happened
Jeremy corbyn won an enormous victory in
2017. that we didn't
yes the biggest victory that labor had
won in a generation he lost he didn't
become Prime Minister
then what happened is the British
establishment including your newspaper
came down on him with a ton of bricks
with false deceitful propaganda about
anti-Semitism all exposed as lies
totally that's just not true I'm afraid
that's just not true labor MPS left the
labor party because of anti-Semitism uh
when Jeremy corbyn was leading it was
nothing to do with with what I was doing
the labor MPS quit the party in protest
at Jeremy corbyn's record absolutely the
Parliamentary party the Blair rate
parliamentary party did not want to see
in fact they said it we have the
documents in the labor files say we do
not want to lose our party the party
that we own to this effort to develop a
popular based party working for working
people in the poor we don't want to lose
our party today no that's not what they
said that's not what they said they did
not want Jeremy called he said you could
read it in the labor thing they did not
say they did not want a government that
wanted to act for the poor what they
said was they will not earn someone yes
exactly lose their party all right
or the track record of tolerating
anti-Semitism in the labor party and uh
taking anti-west positions including
wants to give Russia the benefit of the
doubt over the Salisbury poisonings was
one of the big things that they they
protested there's no there's no
anti-west positions for example when
Jeremy corbyn uh takes the position that
we ought to try to move towards a
negotiated settlement in Ukraine that's
not an anti-west position only has a
Ukraine position the party line party
line I don't have a party line I'm just
asking you a question about Jeremy
corbyn twice went up for election and
twice he didn't become Prime Minister
that's two defeats
jerem let's read let's go back to the
fact
2017 he lover he won the big he lost he
lost sorry there was the biggest labor
man in history then came the that was it
no it wasn't he lost that it was the
biggest labor union in history then yeah
well no it wasn't on what basis was it
then came the enormous establishment
attack crossed the board right to left
so it's called Left Guardian with
deceitful lies all since exposed about
charges of anti-Semitism no that's not
true I'm sorry the the equality in Human
Rights Commission in the UK the Watchdog
set up by the labor party found the
labor party guilty of not protecting
Jews within the party less
anti-Semitism in the labor party than
among the Tories this has all been
exposed in detail by the labor files you
can read it and Al Jazeera the British
press has chosen to mostly suppress it
and marginalize it but that's a problem
for the British press Corbin
has since been virtually kicked out of
the labor party his effort to try to
develop a popular based party
participatory party that would serve the
interests of working people in the poor
was smashed by the British establishment
to Scandal okay but it has nothing to do
with these other things that we're
talking about now well Bob I suppose my
original question was how does politics
change in the western America and
Britain is Keith Stormer the right
person to try and
recalibrate Britain's position in the
world to not toe the line that you're
you're talking about what do you think
of Kirsten
how has it done you know perfectly well
take the New Deal in the 1930s which I'm
old enough to remember first I think
the labor movement in the United States
had been crushed almost totally by
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare
1930s began to recoup reorganize uh CIO
organizing actions moderately
sympathetic Administration
introduced Social Democratic policies
which in fact
were later picked up by Europe in the
post-war period That's the Way politics
changed
something else has hurt them
40 years ago Reagan and Thatcher
launched a major assault against the
population
class war bitter class war
First Act they undertook was to destroy
the Liberty Movement very sensible
it's the one defense against bitter
class reward then came uh I'd go through
the details if you like but if you want
a number we have it from the Rand
Corporation
respectable Corporation they estimate
the transfer of wealth from the lower 90
percent of the population working class
in middle class
transfer of wealth to them to the top
one percent during the Reagan years
Clinton and the rest of them at 50
trillion dollars that's impressive class
war
lift the population the real wages for
non-supervisory workers are about what
they were in 1979 a case after case I
can go through if you like similar
things have happened elsewhere Britain
with the harsh recording program said
written way back continent has held out
somewhat they still have some residue of
the Social Democratic policies uh all of
this is left
populations angry resentful
distrustful institutions quite rightly
easy Prairie to demagogues of the Trump
or Bond bolsonaro or farage variety okay
that's what's happened in the last 40
years how do you change it the way it
changed it in the 1930s but political
election and organization revitalization
the labor movement and so on that's not
a secret
has there been a
British prime minister or American
president that you liked
in your lifetime
foreign
did some pretty rotten things but it was
a decent pool
and do you feel like you're I've started
off thought about you being a public
intellectual you've written so many it
must be millions of words dozens of
books articles
um do you feel like you've you've failed
in making the case this case you've been
making for such a long time and it just
hasn't at any point resonated on either
side of the Atlantic
there are successes and failures
so one major success was
after about 25 years of effort
uh finally helping to organize enough
popular opposition to the U.S British
support for the worst probably the worst
act of genocide since the second world
war namely the Indonesian invasion of
East Timor backed by the United States
by Britain uh killed maybe a third of
the population
well didn't kill everybody so there was
a flight success
they still survive there are other cases
like that during the 1980s the ADI War
moved from the 1970s with 60s
mainly 1960s a heavily involved and we
couldn't left the U.S
massacres and destruction of
all of Indochina but it didn't go to the
terminal point something survived so
that's a impartial success
1980s Reagan hoped to emulate early
steps tried to emulate what Kennedy had
done in into China there was so much
public opposition he had to back off had
the resort to Terror massive Terror a
couple hundred thousand people killed
every
kind of torture you can imagine the
country's wrecked but it wasn't Vietnam
okay so there are partial successes
do you ever think
maybe I'm the one who's wrong
one
do you ever think maybe I'm the one
who's wrong that you've you've that you
you might be wrong
of course all the time I was much too
late in getting involved in the
opposition to the Vietnam War I began to
get seriously involved when Kennedy
radically escalated the war in the early
60s should have been involved 10 years
earlier
there's many other things
and funny then um let's round this off
let's try and be a bit more optimistic
do you think
that we can turn these things around you
were talking about climate change before
global conflict will the next Century be
better than the last
there won't be organized human life a
century from now unless we reverse the
course the leadership is now taking
towards uh racing over the Christmas on
climate destruction you read the latest
ipcc report I'm sure okay
pretty accurate an ipcc or consensus
reports so they're by definition
conservative
lowest uh no the lowest common company
yeah yeah the current one they took off
the gloves they are so desperate by now
that they said well tell the truth
that's the if
what are Western leaders doing
mostly racing in the opposite direction
upbeat notes but I fear that I fear that
the the future might not be that upbeat
no I'm told thank you so much for
joining us on times radio
