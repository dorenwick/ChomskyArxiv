okay gnome I'm so happy to uh to have
you here and I should say I'm I'm having
this chance to talk with you on the
occasion of your being awarded a prize
for your efforts on behalf of the
freedom of speech at universities from
the rinard h freedom of Science
Foundation and the award is Minister
administered by the deutser hul verbond
which is a group representing about
30,000 academics in Germany so first of
all congratulations
and uh and and congratulations on this
welld deserved prize and they've they've
asked me to ask you a variety of
questions and I I've uh edited some of
the questions and added some of my own
and so here goes well let let Let's uh
let's just be go get through them um the
first thing I want to say is while this
issue of freedom of speech at
universities is really become come to
the for in a lot of new ways as you and
I have discussed many times on my
podcast and in other places um and while
I've been writing a lot about it
recently you've been dealing with this
for for decades this cancel culture is
nothing new to you so I wondered whether
you might want to talk about your
experiences with freedom of speech over
the years at
universities well I've been personally
Lucky in that the I've been at MIT oh my
academic life MIT has pretty good record
not perfect but a pretty good record on
protecting academic freedom and freedom
of speech much better than other
universities that I know of including
ones that are pretty close by in Boston
uh so personally I've been personally
protected by the
administration but uh nevertheless
um for many years and even in my own
University when I was giving talks on
controversial topics at the University
had to have police protection campus
police sometimes Camp City police just
uh picking up the threats and rumors
that they've that they monitor that
other universi is much more
extreme even my own University meetings
have been broke
up threats of
violence actually my mail was monitored
for a post campus post office for years
oh really because of death threat
packages
were uh but
uh I personally with the administration
have nothing to complain about and even
when I was facing a federal trial for uh
support for resistance activities
they I'm sure they were getting plenty
of protest from alumni and others but I
was protected from it elsewhere was
quite different
so I mean I've had of course invitations
cancelled book
span actually in one case an entire
publisher destroyed to prevent them from
publishing a book of mine that an
executive for
the corporation that owned the publisher
didn't like things like that others have
had it far worse I mean it's U you can
see it quite easily take uh a simple
word like
socialist I mean in just about every
country in the world outside of
dictatorships uh the word socialist is
kind of like Democrat in the united
states in the United States if you were
called a socialist you could barely get
an academic job almost
impossible I mean if there actually are
articles in major
journals one of the major journals in on
International
Affairs review of international Affairs
in London a major journal M two histor
political
science but once wrote an article
pointing out that when they submitted an
article that had a reference to me the
editors insisted that they cut it out
because it would discredit the
journal who called
themselves these happen to be friends
said it
yeah you could hard until the last
couple of years when things have opened
up some but you would be very hard to
find that an economist in the anywhere
in the country who could be regarded as
somewh on the left
certain which is standard
everywhere and there people have drugs
and so on and so personally an economist
like PA Sweezy F economist was never
able to get a job at Harvard where where
he
been as I say cancel culture is
normal it's it's not the it's not it's
not new it's normal you've also
experienced I guess I know we've talked
about this that also in major media like
the New York Times for many years for
many many years your name didn't appear
is that isn't that the case the
case actually in the
last the years I guess in which I've
been fairly public I've had two
interesting Ops in the New York Times
interesting the first one was uh
excerpts from a testimony gave at the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee where
was invited to give testimon they ran
some that was that during the Vietnam
War
or was that
was it during the Vietnam War was that
during the Vietnam war 70 uh 70 okay the
other was an interesting one they
invited me to write an oped on Israel's
separation
wall which was pretty surprising yeah an
opinion critical but uh and they didn't
have anybody they could find the right
complain about
that I say for others it's been much
harsher huh huh wow okay well you know
in this regard you and I there are some
new things both you and I it can be fair
to say have politics that are left of
center um but until recently it seemed
the right was at the time might have
been the greatest threat to free speech
but now on C campuses it seems like the
left is a threat with their Rel almost
religious views about social justice and
their focus on gender
language migration and identity politics
uh so that seems to be a bigger Pro
problem on campus now do you agree with
that that that's the biggest problem on
campuses right
now it's competes with
the standard problem and in terms of
personal activities
faculty students yes it's a bigger
problem people have to be feel they
walking on eggshells because they might
hurt someone's feelings so a lot of this
I think I wouldn't call the left a lot
of it is teenage uncertainty about just
who I am so young kids teenagers
mostly are beginning to be concerned to
an extent that they never were about
problems of race gender
depression and they often go
overboard give you an example from a
university I happen to know pretty
well a uh you know occasionally you see
people on street corners is probably
mentally Disturbed holding signs saying
Jesus will save you and better clothes
and so on you've seen that yeah well one
of them wandered into a a space public
space near the entrance to the
university and the
students their feelings are hurt by
seeing got to the point where a student
movement was calling on the trustees to
resign unless they could eliminate this
threat to their hurt feelings you know
and it became a major campus issue well
this has nothing to do with the LIF what
this is is teenage
kids understanding the first time in
their lives that a lot of people's
feelings are hurt by authentic serious
oppression and just not making
distinctions it's not their feelings
that are being hurt for them they
privileged kids
that's a
joke but in some hopelessly mistaken
effort to show
solidarity they're doing that and
sometimes it backfires so sharply that
they can't even see it one
cases the use of the word
latinx latinx yeah very offensive to
Latinos they hate it they've been very
upset by it but uh people who are want
to be super solidaristic it's just
unusing it even though it's demeaning to
the people that think they're
helping yeah a lot of it is is teenage
immaturity absolutely I think encouraged
unfortunately by many parents um who are
coddle them right now and by faculty and
and by faculty and encouraged by faculty
but there are faculty of course who are
who are constrained and afraid to talk
about gender or diversity issues or
affirmative action issues or who are
penalized for talking about that so so
it's there is some that I think the
immature children are a large part of it
but I worry that that the immature
children include many administrators at
universities it is I mean um there are
plenty of cases
but even of people who resigned
can't handle it don't want to live like
this but but I do hesitate to call it
the left I think what it is
is an over overreaction vast
overreaction to genuine concerns which
have appeared for the first time and you
have to figure out how to deal with them
with the right degree of appreciation
and sympathy but not Toler opting any of
this and that can be done so for example
at my own University Arizona there was a
student launched protest against
inviting
someone recognized scientists who you
they like or dislike dis well they
started
a protest and the faculty did react play
sympathetic moderate response saying the
wrong thing to do couldn't do this kind
of thing understand your feelings but
this is not the way to deal with it and
I thought well that was very good that
that's nice to hear unfortunately
it there are too there are many cases of
Faculty rather
supporting the the students I mean
understand understanding as you do that
their intent is good but not telling
them that that it's not the right thing
to do but instead supporting their their
nonsense sometimes right thing to do
wrong thing to do in principle but it's
tactically
idiotic it's a it's just a gift to the
right wi they love it in fact
the Republican campaign this year is
running on it they picked up the notion
of critical race Theory nobody has a
clue what it
is the main in the figure pushing it
Christopher rufo he said openly look we
don't care what it is we're just using
it as a cover for everything we don't
like and that's opposition to critical
race Theory whatever that is is
now the lead campaign issue it's what
won the Virginia race for that's right
it certainly it certainly won the
Virginia race the concern about critical
race Theory being parents to break into
school board
meetings
denounce the members and charge them
with making our children feel
uncomfortable in fact Trump himself
issued an executive order against
allowing any federal fund for
educational programs that make white
children they say just children but it
means white children feel
uncomfortable like teaching authentic
history and in fact that's the real
thing there are now dozens of states
with Republican Governors and
legislators which are passing laws
Banning books we haven't had that for a
long time yeah no it's right well in
fact we're going to get to the to the uh
some of the orders of President Trump
but let me let me let me let me read
this next question which was um um you
signed this letter on Justice and open
debate which was published in the 7th of
July 2020 in Harper's magazine and 150
prominent personalities from art culture
and scientific scenes protested against
quote a climate of intolerance and
warned against a limitation of free
exchange of information ideas so the
question is what was your motivation for
participating in that
letter well at first I wasn't going sign
it because it was so anod and vacuous I
didn't see any point in signing it yeah
but finally I decided what the
heck then the roof in huge reaction
which validated the
letter yeah it wasn't from teenagers it
was from established people
who people who just went and went
hysterical about it uh how can you sign
a letter that has another signer who
once said something negative about
transgender people I mean yeah I know in
fact I actually I'm sad to say I know
one signer who later on expressed regret
for signing it for precisely that reason
and I
thought by that logic which grown-ups
are supposed to understand by that logic
You' never sign anything absolutely
absolutely that I think that's what's
that's where people are trying
unfortunately that's what's happening
people are are rather not not signing
not speaking because if you because if
you can offend anyone then you can
offend
anyone and that but there's no way to
know who might sign the same letter
absolutely the only thing to do is kill
all protest letters no more letter
about Chinese tratment weers can't sign
them because somebody else might sign it
who once said some thing about talk
about yeah it's just a grownup serious
recognized academic would be able to
think at least that
for overwhel yeah no this this need to
Virtue signal is just uh astounding well
some people might say that before the
internet there was a limitation on Free
Speech imposed from above you had very
limited access to information but the
internet has Dem democratized
information and previously marginalized
people are now able to make themselves
heard more effectively and in some cases
they control the debate so what do you
think about this claim that the internet
in some sense has improved the situation
by allowing marginalized people now to
speak out and also get information they
didn't get
before an interesting qu factual
question is whether the internet has
increased people's
knowledge access understanding or
whether it's decreased it and I think a
pretty strong case can be made that it's
decreased it one the number of things
that are unanticipated but I mean I
happen to be sitting in the lab where
the internet was basically developed
back was in the oran that
yeah absolutely the best of intentions
the point was to improve communication
among scientists make life easier made a
lot of sense uh and it has done that a
lot of scientific work is done through
internet I work with a group of senior
researchers all over the world we
communicate on life course by internet
sure plenty of access to you know pre
publication documents and so on and I I
don't know for you but I've written
papers with people I've actually never
met but only collaborated with on the
internet jointly writing yeah so that's
worked but it's had other effects one of
the effects has been to destroy
newspapers newspapers were the source of
information they had all kind of flaws
you can point but nevertheless they were
the main General overwhelmingly reliable
source of some kind of picture of the
world well had a devastating effect
local press has
disappeared there used to be serious
local newspapers in the
united Boston Globe
was
newspaper editor journalists were
friends reporting in Central America
they had Euros all over the world San
Francisco Chronicle Los Angeles Times
Detroit free quite a lot of them all
gone almost nothing left the reason is
the advertising model
collapsed now and in fact even to the
National level United States is down to
one National
newspaper which is shocking the New York
Times and sharply decreased in coverage
yeah it takes me a fraction of the time
to read it to now that it did a couple
of years ago
yeah quality is also I would argue
decreased but anyway I don't know
whether you agree with that one of the
other effect is it has as you say given
people an opportunity
to you know speak in public you can set
up a Blog a
podcast the but that doesn't you that
has a very mixed Effect one effect is
and pretty well studied is to draw draw
people into bubbles of
self-reinforcing uh feeling so if
somebody
says you I I have evidence that the
vaccine harms people more than it helps
them okay somebody else will write in
and say yeah my ant had a had reaction
somebody else picks up pretty soon you
have an antivaccine moving which
is rushing hospitals with
unvaccinated infected people to the
extent that they're they have to
withdraw normal procedures people are
dying from cancer because they can't be
dealt with because they words are the
emergency words and IC words are
overfilled well that's not a joke a lot
of people are dying from this and this
is the kind of thing that happens when
you can build a self reinforcing bubble
where people turn
because kind of the way I feel sort of
get your own opinions Amplified never
hear anything else I me newspapers
aren't wildly diverse but they have some
range of coverage in opinion these
things have essentially nothing and it's
it happens on the left too and it's
understandable people will naturally
turn to things where they think they'll
hear something that they want to know to
you know ratify their views yeah people
want people like to like to be validated
and uh yeah it's overal assessment might
be negative it has tremendous positive
potential but it's had a very mixed
effect yeah I I think that tend to think
that there you know it's a vast source
of information but it's a vast source
misinformation and the tools to
distinguish between the two are
something that a lot of people either
don't have or don't want to have and we
don't teach in schools the tools should
be a serious education yeah so we go
back to what's happening in the
educational institution one of the
things they ought to be doing is
teaching serious critical inquiry and
unfortunately part of the neoliberal
programs of the past 40 years have been
to undermine public education seriously
I mean everything from
sharping to turning the educational
curriculum from kindergarten on up to uh
root learning and teaching to test which
is absolutely the worst kind of teaching
this is as an incidental Obama
administration was in the for front of
yeah the teachers who are told they just
can't let students pursue their own
interests which is what an education
ought to do because they have to make
sure they can pass the next
p and we all know from our own
experience you can take a course you had
no interest in yeah last week you gram
for the test and best test and a couple
weeks later you forgot what the course
is about
yeah education has become standard and
uh the Al and the defunding is very
serious state colleges and universities
particularly have been seriously harmed
by just sharp withdrawal of any
funding and of course
that still like you know you'll still
get funding from U the cach brothers for
a free
not for
yeah philosophy Department yeah well
speaking philosophy departments uh
here's a question um studies show that a
quarter of American academics working in
the fields of humanities are in favor of
excluding colleagues who have a wrong
opinion about controversial subjects
like immigration or the difference
between the Sexes the case of the
English philosopher Kathleen stock has
lately received much attention in the
academic world she's been mobbed by
transgender activists to resign would
you agree that the English and American
universities have a particular problem
with the freedom of
speech Yes because just as they always
have like the you go back to the
McCarthy period um there were occasional
cases of scientists mathematicians who
were subjected the Massive Attack on
universities but not for
much U take MIT again which I knew
best famous physicist you know well Phil
Morrison was under attack by the
house on American Affairs committee he
had been in as a student and member of
the Communist party and at leftist
interest so but MIT had no hesitation
about giving them a senior 10 10 your
position by the way yeah he was an
Institute Professor I think yeah pretty
standard Sciences have been protected by
the fact that in the Sciences you can't
get away with utter
nonsense not
yet I mean if you decide that you don't
believe theory of relativity you're not
going to be able to teach physics well I
I hope it continues that way as I hear
people talk
about about about getting rid of science
that's been produced by scientists who
themselves were either racist or
misogynist you know I worry about I do
worry about I do worry about the
teaching of science to worry about but
it's it's immediately detected in The
Sciences as something improper yeah
absolutely social sciences it's the
norm it literally is the norm people get
their PHD in some small area they carve
out an area of expertise and they pursue
that for the rest of their lives and
they never want to hear anything else
that's not unusual and you can easily do
it in the humanities and social sciences
and even be called a serious important
scholar you just don't have the
protective effect
of the truth
leaping at your throat all the time so
nonsense can become established SCH
scholarship and exclusion of ideas can
be is also a norm and I think that uh
the uh Paris culture of the past 30
years 40 years is also
harmed the
postm attack
on uh credibility on truth and so on and
it's interesting to see how the sciences
and the humanities reacted to that and
the Sciences it did attack The
Sciences do
ridicule books things like Ian
Soo dangerous Illusions you
know when Bruno lur historian of
science argued at one point they they
ridiculed the they somebody had written
an article claiming that it could show
that one of the Pharaohs died of
tuberculosis and he wrote an article
ridiculing this thing tuberculosis
social construct wasn't invented
to but in the humanities and social
sciences uh it's becomes a major
phenomenon well and and and now to pick
up on that there both books written as
you probably know arguing that
postmodernism has morphed and in fact
whether you want to call critical race
Theory something real or not this notion
for example of embedded oppression and
white supremacy as part of
scholarship overall is is is naturally
meshes with the postmodern notion of of
uh of of of U of oppressive ideas and
lack of objectivity the re refusing to
accept objective
reality if everything is just power and
bias so what's the debate yeah exactly
close to that like fuk for
example
so I I think overall it's had a harmful
effect uh plus the fact I have to admit
that I can't make any sense of it that's
TR yeah I know what you mean
I I was talking to someone the other day
and I said I remember you wouldn't have
you you didn't watch TV like I did but
but there was an episode of a show that
I used to like called The Dick Van Dyk
show and um and where one of the the
heads of IT guy named Carl Riner said
what is what on the surface seems vague
is in reality
meaningless and I've always remembered
that line it's often
true to go back to the original point
the creation of a culture on campus
where you're afraid to open your mouth
of the IDE even the idea of safe spaces
trigger
warnings as if somehow we have to ensure
that young people never hear anything
that makes them think and disturbs them
just should be just the opposite College
a time when you're thinking about things
you never wanted to think about before
when your ideas are being challenged
when you challenge them yourselves
that's education well I've often said
the purpose of science but I think more
generally of education is in some sense
to make you uncomfortable because if
you're comfortable then you're really
not learning but in the Sciences is
teaching what they were teaching five
years ago either their brain dead or
their yeah exactly well let's see it it
it the next question is in the be this
is an interesting question I'll see if
you what you think about it in the best
of all possible worlds what should a
true academic debate look like and what
will what should academics have to
tolerate in order to have
one well first of all the idea of an
academic debate is I think the wrong
word I I agree with you there was change
of people with different
ideas but it's the a debate suggests
a debates have a principle you're not
allowed to change your mind yeah on
the Oxford or Yale debating team what
you're taught is you have to hold you
have to take any position and you have
to hold on to it no matter what the
other guy says you're not allowed to say
to the opponent that was a good
idea it's the extreme of irrationality
so I think we should drop the notion of
debate I mean if Einstein didn't agree
with ideas about yeah point was an
interchange discussion let's think of
possible experiments they might settle
it and so on so that should take place
all the time we don't there's a lot that
we don't understand physics is by far
the most advanced science but ask 10
physicist what a particle is you get 10
different it's and that's a healthy
science there too much we don't
understand so there should be
alternative positions proposed discussed
analyzed arguments constructed against
them there should be conjecture
reputation what makes the field alive
and if a college education doesn't
encourage and stimulate that failing
absolutely every area and it's worse if
it if it doesn't encourage it it's bad
enough if it discourages it it's worse
and that's that's a concern and when
basically debate is openly discouraged I
think that's I mean you might as well
just close down the
university it should be completely open
in fact let's go back to the excesses of
cancel culture I'm going suppose
somebody's invit reled to the university
whose views you don't like well the
worst reaction is to drive them off
campus wrong in principle and tactically
suicidal the right answer is say fine
come to campus we'll come to your talk
and raise questions we'll set up an
alternative session where we look into
to the things you've written and discuss
them and analyze
it's an educational
experience an opportunity for an
educational experience let's use the
opportunity yeah in fact it's an
opportunity also to to to learn that you
may be wrong I mean that's all that you
know that the person actually may have
some make making some sense which
is in these sessions devoted to the
person's work let's have ad
Aries People participating with
different opinions it's not a session to
organize a hate attack there have been
things like that in
universities my own University for
examp I learned about this indirectly
but
about 50 years ago I guess the political
science department actually had a course
that devoted to attacking me oh
congratulations I was invited to a
session to defend myself
really okay well I as you know I when I
was at MIT I didn't take a course in
political science department but I did
take a course from you anyway um is
there a point where legitimate criticism
ends namely where where where there
should there is a limitation on freedom
of speech or fre or or science and any
is there any any re rational place where
there might be such
limitations well my own personal feeling
is that freedom of speech in the United
States has a very interesting history
contrary to what people believe that the
first amendment has almost nothing to
say about it it's not in the First
Amendment first allows governments to
send people to jail for things they've
said nothing against that in the first
amendment in fact freedom of speech
didn't really become a major issue in
the United States until the 20th
century you see what's a major issue
when you take a look at Supreme Court do
it reached Supreme Court in the 20th
century and at first The Advocates were
in dissenting opinions homes and
brandise and the descents were very mild
like The Descent actually supported the
Judgment but raised questions about it
wasn't really until the
1960s that you get a strong defense
freedom of speech interesting 64 the
Supreme Court struck down sovereign
immunity which almost all countries
still have including England and Canada
the doctrine that you can't attack the
say state with speech that's sovereign
immunity that still holds in and it
still applied incidentally was shut was
knocked down in the United States in
1964 although today's reactionary court
is considering reinstating it I should
say but the strongest opinion and the
most important one was in
1969 was a case involving the klooks
clan there was an effort to shut down a
cook Clan rally Clan is violent Mur mous
racists and the court voted in favor of
the clan said this is brandenberg the
Ohio very important case it set down a
Doctrine which said essentially that
speech should be free up to imminent
participation participation in imminent
criminal acts so for example if you and
I go into a store to rob it and I have a
gun and you're at the cast register and
you say shoot that's not free speech
it's
participation in this case in an ongoing
but even in an imminent critical act I
think that's a pretty good you yeah I
guess there's I don't know if it came
from that case but there's the famous
example of yelling fire in a crowded
theater I guess when there isn't one U
like any
fluid but General lead principle it's a
sensible principle yeah sure and I think
incidentally I suspect the United States
may be the only country that has that
principle at least on paper on paper
that's interesting so the other Western
democracies actually don't have it I
think that's probably France has a law
that says that the state has the right
to determine historical truth and punish
deviation from punish anyone who says
that's not historical well in fact
actually that leads to the next question
speaking of states and and Fon States uh
having rules about what you can say
about things like the Holocaust in the
early 80s you defended the freedom of
speech of the French literary scholar
Robert foron who denied the Holocaust of
course without showing his
opinion um some would say that
universities a matter as a matter of
public responsibility should not allow
certain persons for example those in the
extreme right to present themselves in
public but in this case who should who
should decide who can speak at
universities well that's an interesting
case and the consequences are
interesting the person in question s was
a minor academic unknown academic at a
provincial University who privately
published a couple of monographs in
which he raised questions about whether
there were gas Chambers at
D if people had let him
alone nobody would have ever heard of it
no ever heard of anything but French
left intellectuals decided they have to
make a he hadn't denied the Holocaust
cons oh interesting later but uh they
decided we have to be brave and bold and
prevent protect history from this so
they made a huge issue of it he became a
famous person Holocaust denial which
happened came later became a huge issue
he was
finally
sentenced by the courts for violation
for actually not for Holocaust denial if
you look at the court proceedings but
for misusing documents those
sort when is it became a huge monstrous
issue which nobody would ever heard of
if it had been left alone well
that's has the same lessons apply to the
cancel culture people you keep fight to
keep somebody off campus or keep them
from being employed in the physics
department because you don't like what
they said about
diversity you're you're just giving them
a first of all it's totally wrong in
principle but technically ridiculous
you're doing them a huge favor
followers platform you know stands
up well you know what about um this this
new University of Austin that claims to
be an alternative to a liberal
developments at American universities
what do you think about
it I think it's frankly a
joke
okay couple of people who feel AG
grieved U I'm waiting to see if their
first Department of Middle East studies
and who they invite to be professors and
lecturers uh I think it's basically a
bad joke and okay and Wither on the vine
as it
should what problems quite generally the
universities have
a fairly decent record there's a lot of
there are a lot of things wrong there
always have been but fundamentally
there's a core that stands up for
authentic academic freedom including
freedom of speech things like what I
described on my on Camp They're Not
Unusual yeah sure well I you know I
think I think that's true for a lot I
mean of course being at MIT you know I
think you had an interesting experience
but I do know there are academics I do
know at at certain universities where
really there really isn't any tradition
of free speech anymore certain small
liberal arts colleges in this country
especially there are small mostly
marinal universities where that's true
and they are under what I describe about
the Jesus will save you yeah University
happens to be a State University but
no real history on any of these issues
yeah students haven't been students come
from local high schools they never heard
a thing about any of
this you know all that they know is we
just learned that there's oppression and
we have
to we have to decide about binary gender
and all things they never heard of in
their lives and it becomes overwhelming
they don't have a uh Rec uh training
history immersion and critical inquiry
thinking truth are easily susceptible to
social media bubbles which raise
temperatures and arous feelings and
don't give an opportunity to think well
the way the university will respond to
this is with educational program it
should be by educa exactly with
educational programs and encouraging
debate and encour and telling kids that
hey you know they Truth Hurts sometimes
and being uncomfortable is part of the
process I just wish I happen to
I I'm more concerned I guess most
concerned about academic administrators
who don't seem to have the backbone to
to speak up well the academic
administrators also lack the backgrounds
in critical
ingre you're right one of the things
that's happened over the past 40 years
is in position of a business model on
colleges and
universities which means that the you
have a sharp increase in
administrators and a reduction of the
role of the faculty actually is a
important book that appeared by
wellknown sociologist Benjamin Ginsburg
called The Fall of the faculty
documenting the extent to which faculty
have been replaced by professional
administrators in Running of
universities uh you see this all over
yeah it's really espeically bad in the
University of California system if you
look at the ratio of money spent on
administrators versus
fault I mean it used to be that you knew
the Provost you knew the president they
were just faculty members who moved to
an administrative position for a couple
of years no it's professional
administrators to a large extent yeah
you might tell you at least they're
still scientists but in many places just
people from the business
world don't that don't have that that I
think you said it perfectly they
themselves don't have the experience in
in critical thinking and inquiry that's
necessary and they certainly don't stand
up for it there are few of course there
are a few
exceptions um now here's one from uh
initiated by the deutser hwu verbond who
are administrating this award and the
and the Conrad Adenauer Foundation
recently scientists have been asked in
two rounds about limitations on
intellectual exchange at their
universities in the survey from 2019 and
20120 31% of the interviewed confirmed
that they were strongly Limited in their
teaching activities by formal or
informal demands of political
correctness since then the percentage
has risen to 40%
the percentage of scientists who say
that political correctness hinders them
from doing certain research has risen
from 13% to
18% you want to comment on
that well the disparity in numbers
corresponds to what we were talking
about yeah I want to ask what is the
curtailment uh say in physics courses
when somebody says they're restrict in
what they say what are they referring to
maybe forgetting the name of a black
student let's say case that
actually well forget the name of a
student you
apologize things over period uh it may
it might be that students who are
concerned about 400 years of violent
oppression of black Americans think you
ought to do more than that fine let's
talk about it yes there is this history
we have to be sensitive to sorry I
forgot your name now let's go back to
work exactly but now let's go back to
work that could be mentioned as
curtailment of what you say you took off
a couple minutes to address a real
problem okay nothing wrong with
that yeah no if you if you if it's just
a couple of minutes and you're allowed
to teach afterwards yeah
that's what you have to look into what
are these cases reacting to that's a
very good question point you have to
surveys like this have the problem that
people feel grieved for many reasons and
and and and and and it just like young
people different perception of what
agreement or or or or being or being uh
having rights infringed are we hope that
a mature adult would
understand how to deal with a question
but these are these are faculty
members that doesn't mean
they're as you and I both
know um okay here's an question um to
what extent can the freedom of science
be jeopardized by financial support for
research from companies and things like
that you concerned about that oh quite a
lot in fact there's something ironic
that the left doesn't understand and
I've been fighting about this
for 70 years with friends who regard
themselves as on the left if you look
over the history of research in the
United States since the second world
war in the 50s and the 60s there was the
US had a
major what's called industrial policy in
other countries you're not allowed to
use the word industrial policy in the
United States one of
those so initiated by vavar Bush
understood the great technological
developments that were made scientific
technological developments during the
second world war said we got to continue
with that in the post-war world so the
government did have substantial
investment in
research
uh development development of research
univers I's funding of
the my own University MIT moved from a
engineering school to a major university
because of this funding well the easy
way to get funding out of Congress is to
say
defense that way you get your grants
accepted so most of the funding was
through the Pentagon the Pentagon was
the best funer ever they didn't care
what you were doing know what you were
doing just do your work and shut
up calculate shut up the
famous yeah so you didn't have to put in
Grant proposals nothing nobody in the
left can understand that they assume
that if if you're working on you know
problems of philosophy and for the
defense department you must be working
for the war machine well finally this
reached Congress
and in
1969 Congress passed a law the Mansfield
Amendment which stipulated that any
funding from the Pentagon the dod has to
have a specific military
purpose that had a cheapening effect on
Research probably mainly affected
research Grant proposals so you'd put in
a fake military thing in the front and
you're actually doing in the back but it
and it was part of a much broader wave
of
reducing Government funding in favor of
corporate funding so you you take a
major research University like M the
percentage of corporate funding
increased quite sharply in the 70s 80s
and later and they had an
effect uh when the Pentagon fund
something or the NIH fund something
something they just are doing it for the
society not for
themselves uh if a corporation fund
something it's for them they want
something they they can use not their
competitors and in the short term so
there's much more pressure for
short-term research and introduction of
secrecy for the first time there was
never any
secrecy any
when it was Pentagon funded the question
never even came
up soon as corporate funding came up
there were students working in a on a
grant had to sign statements saying
they're not going to talk to some other
professors there were even cases which
became scandalous The Wall Street
Journal actually had an article about a
case at MIT where student refused to
answer questions in an exam by one
Professor when he was asked why he said
I'm working for a grant for this other
professor and there's a condition on it
that I can't talk about this I mean
that's what you affect expect when you
have imposing business models and
corporate funding in fields like
computer science the research term much
more short term yeah applied
people had big ideas about longer term
things we want to fund them that's going
to be everybody not me and uh it's had a
cheapening effect this is you know I
think the universities are strong enough
to withstand it but the effect is there
yeah the the the people who are opposed
to Government funding research don't
realize that that's exactly the case
government is the only only only
organism that can fund long-term
research without a short term payoff um
and and and most of the most important
much of the I should well much of the
most important research is exactly that
the the the research where Serendipity
has changed things if as people often
say if they if they funded people to
build better computers back in the 1950s
uh they'd be building computers with
wheels and pulleys instead of the
transistor at you know at Bell Labs
where they were just sort of more or
less free to people had to go around the
a
computer which was then a big room full
vac had to go around with vacuum
cleaners oriented in the wrong direction
so they could the dust off the
vacuum yeah yeah it's a different world
before I get the next question which
something you said was interesting so
you're write when the when when when
things changed and people were working
for mil the the government imposed this
rule that you had to be doing real
military research people put in boil
plate language but things have changed
now where um most most I think it's fair
to say most funding in science for
example requires people to put a
diversity statement in um I I know of a
professor in Canada who who didn't get
funded for laser research because his he
happens to be Indian and his colleagues
one was Mexican one was a female but he
didn't he he didn't get funded because
he said I just hire anyone an
independent of raise color or Creed for
this component for a laser um what do
you think about
that certainly shouldn't happen
diversity isn't something you sign in a
statement about if it's not internal to
you doesn't matter whether you signed a
statement or not if people whoever this
professor was he shouldn't sign a
statement but he might want to discuss
with somebody the issues of diversity
why are students bring it up something
we would understand we're grown-ups we
should be interested in understanding
what is motivating our students to
impose demands which are
improper okay let's ask what's
motivating them sure maybe that it's
worth thinking about yeah sure but when
a government agency says how is this
component of this laser going to
increase diversity is it's it's it's I
can't understand those words it should
be kind of like inviting a speaker to
campus who you don't like an opportunity
to think
yeah okay yeah I agree it should be that
and it would be nice and I'm
particularly concerned uh when federal
agencies don't can't tell the difference
but um uh and funding agencies it's
happening lately um in I'm seeing real
examples but in any case here's one the
US is perceived by many Europeans as a
divided polarized country
do you see Europe threatened by the same
polarity indeed is the threat in Europe
greater well the polar there is a lot of
talk about polarization in the US as
well a little bit
misleading the
uh the great mass of the
polarization is the drift
of center right conservatives to the
very far right
that has led to extreme
polarization you look at the there's
recently been a study
of Republican voters Trump voters
General attitudes on a range of topics
compared with
Europeans turns out their General
attitudes line up with the far right in
Europe just about what's considered left
in the United States
there was an article couple months ago
by an editor of the London Financial
Times major Business
Journal uh she pointed out that if
Bernie
Sanders far left in the United States
that if he were in Germany he could be
running on the Christian
Democrat which in fact is true just take
a look at his major policy proposals
Universal Health Care free higher
education Child Care maternal leave I
mean center right programs in most of
Europe yeah that's a
polarization it's from something that is
mildly Social Democratic to the very far
right and that is a major threat to
American democracy the people who are
warning about this are not
uh extreme not uh going overboard it's
true there is a very serious threat to
American democracy when one of the two
political parties is essentially
declaring we're not in favor of
democracy we are in favor of taking
power and those who don't F who don't
vote for us are not true Americans
they're literally saying that yeah
they're saying if you don't vote for us
you're not a real American your vote
doesn't count we're going to stop it in
one way or another if you manage to get
too many votes we'll just do something
to save the country from you people who
are destroying the society when this
becomes anything more than a marginal
voice and it
is problem so I think are warning about
about the potential collapse of American
democracy are not shouting in the in the
door well in that that case what how is
there what can one do and do you think
it it the future bolds the end of not
just democracy in the US but nation
states in in in
general the nation state
is the nation state is not a
historical phenomenon it's a modern
phenomenon developed in Europe very
recently in fact countries like Italy
are still consolidating the nation state
you go back 50 years teaching in a
German University you'd sometimes have
to teach the students
German local language was not mutually
comprehensible with German
I mean I remember a former student of
mine who specialized in German
Linguistics wanted to after his
Doctorate wanted to live in Germany and
work there he got a job in a German
University in which he was teaching
German
student was true 50 years earlier Italy
it's still true uh the na that's one
indication of the formation of nation
states in Europe fortunately in my
opinion the nation states has begun to
eroute the lot of problems with the
European Union plenty of but some very
good things like the shanken agreement
which he Road borders means you're an
Italian student you can do your
doctorate work in Germany you know want
to travel to from Italy to Germany You
Don't Have To Cross borders so okay
that's all steps forward to the nation
there's a negative side like the
European Union illustrates it with the
positive effects of the erosion of
nation states there have also been
negative effects means that basic
decision making is shifted from the
national
communities to bureaucrats in
Brussels Which undermines democracy
people feel rightly they're just not
participants in major decisions that are
made about the Roman sociey so it's a
mixture and you have to work through it
in a say and sensible fashion I think U
you're beginning to see take the United
States the term the phrase United States
in English was plural until the Civil
War United States are United States are
the Federation of states
yeah like the European
un a huge war was
fought worst wars history up to that
time to settled the question of the
whether the phrase United States is
singular or plural well that's many
languages it's still
plural
yeah but these are very serious
questions U and have to try to work
through extensively to form some kind of
balance actually these questions are
very much alive today probably the most
dangerous issue in the world today
immediate issue is
Ukraine and the fundamental issue when
you look at it is whether Ukraine should
be a
federation it be a federation like other
federations including the United States
and which a degree of autonomy to
different
regions
uh that's basically the donbas
proposal proposal let's have a
federation with autonomy that was
actually written into the Minsk 2
agreements uh which were signed by
Ukraine Russia France and Germany hasn't
been implemented but it's in the wording
or should Ukraine rather be a
single
uh state run by the ethnic
majority well that's a that's a problem
that may lead to nuclear war it's not a
small problem we're talking
about yeah no I yeah well I it was
interesting I'm glad we touched on
National nation states I want to I think
I should in in in deference to the award
and also as we go through the last few
questions come back to universities
since the idea was free speech at
universities although I like talking
about about this well it's very
important this issue in Ukraine
especially is a great concern uh let me
let me ask uh let me modify well let me
ask a version of one of the questions
which is coming back to universities
what what where how can freedom of
speech be trained better and would it be
a good idea to install an quote
Ombudsman for spee free speech at
universities or any other proposal to
try and yeah first of all I'm thinking
of American universities which I know
better other UN in France Germany other
places they have their own problems they
have to figure out how to deal with it
in the United States I think a school
education this is not sophisticated
stuff but actually even being certainly
at least in high school students should
study the history of free speech in the
United States which we mentioned briefly
before it's not what's generally
believed and they should learn about the
struggle for freedom of
speech the case in
1964 the first case major case
supporting freedom of speech which
struck down sovereign immunity that grew
out of the Civil Rights Movement okay we
should see how po struggles for freedom
have led to opening up questions which
had been closed before and which
sometimes led to doctrines that are
significant take the clan students
should understand why it was very
important for the Supreme Court to make
a judgment in favor of the clan one of
the most grotesque groups that's ever
existed in the country but yes we
support their right to have a
demonstration and by doing so we
establish a very high level of
protection of freedom of speech those
are things that students should know
about in school by the time they get to
college should be second nature you to
talk about it and then you can talk
about what it implies about our
own okay that deal with it and uh
I think for the rest it's what we've
been talking about yeah sure
that's yeah that that's a great idea
great kind of education in fact that it
would be nice to have it happen I don't
see I see the opposite happening but
yeah it would be um
the this is some side we've heard of
talked about it but I I thought I would
what do you think about that this was
termed in Germany minority quarters but
I'd say affirmative action minority
quotas for admissions to universities
and jobs what do you think about quotas
for races genders Etc and jobs in
universities should have nothing to do
with it just like being a socialist
should have nothing to do with it as it
had been for the last 80 years uh you're
picked for a position because of the
quality of your work uh of course there
is something more uh Congeniality
fitting into a community these are
always factors in appointment
sure University faculty is should be a
cooperating congenial Community doesn't
mean that it throws
out obnoxious people no it
doesn't are often very useful but but
there's a limit you know yeah there's a
li of Civility and that factors into
appointments too so it always has and
always will certainly will people are
people and they're turned off by some
and turned not off I know as chairman of
the department when yeah I remember
trying to hire someone who I thought was
great but incredibly obnoxious but I
couldn't he alienated all my colleagues
within the first 10 minutes of talking
to them and there no there's no
way um what are organizations like the
aaup
do for the defense of of freedom of
Science and freedom of speech
universities do they think they play a
role they should take a strong
stand sometimes they have back in the
days of John
Dewey Zachariah Chi so on they did take
a strong
stand lately they've
been weakened to some extent by the
pressures of
you
know diversity so on yeah yeah okay here
to here's a in the United States and in
the UK some interesting things happen
Trump threatened to cut Federal support
for universities that don't defriend spe
speech as you mentioned and also in
several months ago the British
government set up Provisions which allow
the Ministry of Education to financially
sanction universities that do not defend
free speech and and and also give
individuals the right to sue
universities if they've been deprived of
the right to free speech what do you
think about all that if that were the
case almost every University I know of
would have been sued for for 80 years
actually the serious threat to British
universities is a very different one
it's been described very well by British
analysts
of Education fre
and others stepan Kini is one the Tory
government the rightwing government the
Cameron Government tried and failed
fortunately to challenge the What's
called the Hing principle holdan
principle goes back to the first world
war it's not the whole we know it's a
okay the uh the holdan doctrine
basically said that political cons
itations are not permitted to enter into
grant applications research should be
free of political interference hameron
Government tried to withdraw that they
do a strong reaction they had to back
off but they may pursue it further they
then move to try to impose basically a
market system on
universities so if Oxford wants to have
a Classics department they should show
that it could uh fund itself on the
market uh Stefan Kini M education
writers commented in I think the times
literary supplement that the government
was trying to change first class
universities into third class commercial
Enterprises well that kind of pressure
is the most serious one when Trump or
some other alter right figure says we're
going to protect freedom of speech on
campus they don't mean a word they're
saying even know what they're saying
yeah I want the campus to get rid of
anyone who isn't as far right as I am
that's what it
means
when there is actually an executive
order by Trump saying we have to protect
students from
being having their opinions hurt or
feeling whatever the word is he doesn't
mean that he mean block anything that's
not far right and you can see what he
means by the Legislative programs that
follow from it which are Banning books
Tony Mark for example leading writers
are simply being banned their books are
being destroyed okay that's serious
that's not just uh overdoing things by
teenager sometimes faculty but it's laws
being passed to prevent reading of the
wrong
books it's a very serious issue yeah oh
it is well the LA the last two questions
um look in some sort sense towards the
future what do you see um what do you
see for the future if say a free speech
at universi getting better or worse at a
national and Global
level I don't like can make predictions
myself but but I'm going to ask you to
we can't predict but we can at least
identify the factors one factor is
whether the universities will have
internally the Courage the Integrity to
stand up against social public pressures
which
impune academic freedom and freedom of
speech that's one factor going from the
administrators down to the student
bodies will they commit themselves with
energy to protecting these values in the
educational programs in the way they
behave when pressures arise to do this
or that improper thing the other factor
is what's going to happen in the
society how will the general Society
develop move as it is
moving towards authoritarianism
demeaning of democracy undermining
democracy making that an acceptable
element in the society universities are
not going to be able to withstand it for
long and they must try they shouldn't
capitulate to it but there's only so
much that can be done they must try well
the last question is what is the which
is related what's what's the course of
action that academic scientists and
citizens and students can do to preserve
freedom of speech and freedom of
scientific research what what's what's
the best thing that individuals can
do well it depends who the individuals
are if they're privileged academic or
coost then there's a lot they can do in
their
universities to defend the Integrity of
the institution from attacks on all
sides and as Citizens We're citizens
those who
are have are part of or have been part
of like ports of academic institutions
are privileged the
privilege uh confers
responsibility is and provides opportuni
to use
them we yeah use them speak out and and
and at some point don't yeah don't be
silent in the face of problems I guess
and it's easy to it's easy to it's it's
it's easy to say that and but and hard
to do and I'm and I that's one of the
reasons why I think I know it's one of
the reasons I know that you've been
awarded this award and one of the
reasons of course I've always admired
you it's because you spoken out and and
served as a role model for me to do that
so I thank you for all agreeing to this
interview on behalf of your award welld
deserved and I'm sure that the um that
the uh Reinhard H Foundation for the
freedom of Science and the deutser Haw
verbond will be thrilled to uh to have
heard what you said I know for me it's
uh it's been a a great pleasure so thank
you always good to talk to you
