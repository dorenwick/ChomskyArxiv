Julian Assange has performed an enormous
service to all the people in the world
who treasure the values of freedom and
democracy and who therefore demand the
right to know what their elected
representatives are doing and for that
very reason he's one of the most
dangerous criminals on the face of the
earth pursued with savagery by the
rulers of the free and democratic
societies and there's a reason there is
a basic principle of government that's
well understood by serious analysts
actually it was explained quite clearly
by the professor of the science of
Government at Harvard University the
distinguished liberal political
scientist and government adviser Samuel
Huntington he observed I'll quote him
that the architects of power in the
United States must create a force that
can be felt but not seen power remained
strong when it remains in the dark
exposed to the sunlight it begins to
evaporate and he gave some telling
examples concerning the real nature of
the Cold War he was discussing US
military intervention abroad and he
observed I'll quote him again that you
may have to sell intervention or other
military action in such a way as to
create the misimpression that it is a
Soviet Union that you're fighting that's
what the United States has been doing
ever since the Truman Doctrine and there
are many illustrations of that
leading principal well Julian Assange
has committed the grave crime of
exposing power to sunlight which may
cause power to evaporate if the
population grasps the opportunity to
become independent citizens of a free
society rather than subjects of a master
who operates in secret and that's a
choice and it's long been understood in
fact it has long been understood that
the public can cause power to evaporate
the one leading thinker who understood
and explained this critical fact was
David Hume writing on the first
principles of government in one of the
first modern works of political theory
almost 250 years ago his formulation was
so clear and pertinent that all simply
quoted Hume found nothing more
surprising than to see the easiness with
which the many are governed by the few
and to observe the implicit submission
with which men resigned their own
sentiments and passions to those of
their rulers when we inquire by what
means this wonder is brought about we
shall find that as force is always on
the side of the governed the governors
have nothing to support them but opinion
is therefore an opinion only that
government is founded and this maxim
extends to the most despotic and most
military governments as well as to the
most free and the most popular actually
human underestimates the efficacy of
violence but his words are particularly
appropriate to societies where popular
struggle over many years
has won a considerable degree of freedom
in such societies such as ours of course
really is on the side of the government
government the government and the
governors have nothing to support them
but opinion that is one reason why the
huge public relations industry are the
most immense propaganda agency in human
history a reach that's developed and
reached its most sophisticated forms in
the most free societies United States
and Britain that arose institution arose
about a century ago when elites came to
understand that too much freedom had
been won for the public to be controlled
by force so it would be necessary to
control attitudes and opinions liberal
intellectual elites understood that as
well which is why they urged to give a
few quotes that we must discard
democratic dogmatism 'he's about people
being the best judges of their own
interests they are not they are ignorant
and meddlesome outsiders and therefore
must be put in their place for their own
interests of course quoting highly
respected liberal intellectuals one
device to control the population is to
operate in secret so that the ignorant
and meddlesome Outsiders will stay in
their place remote from the levers of
power which are none of their business
that's the main purpose for
classification of internal documents
anyone who has pored through the
archives of released documents has
surely come to realize pretty quickly
that what is kept secret very rarely has
anything at all to do with security
except for the security of the
leadership
from their domestic enemy the wrong
population the practice is so routine
that illustration is really quite
superfluous I'll mention only one
current case consider the global trade
agreements Pacific and Atlantic in
actuality investor rights agreements
masquerading under the rubric of free
trade they're negotiated in secret with
the nd there's an intention of Stalinist
style ratification by Parliament's yes
or no which of course means yes with no
discussion or debate what's called in
the United States fast-track to be bit
to be accurate they're not negotiated
entirely in secret the facts are known
to the corporate lawyers and lobbyists
who are writing the details in such a
way as to protect the interests of the
constituency that they represent which
is of course not the public the public
on the contrary is an enemy that must be
kept in ignorance Julian Assange's crime
is to violate the fundamental principles
of government to lift the veil of
secrecy that protects power from
scrutiny keeps it from evaporating and
again it is well understood by the
powerful that lifting the veil may cause
power to evaporate it may even lead to
authentic freedom and democracy if an
aroused public comes to understand that
force is on the side of the governed and
if they true they and they it can be
their force if they choose choose to
control their own fate we should all
thank Julian for his courage and
integrity in providing us with
this precious gift great cost to himself
much to our shame
