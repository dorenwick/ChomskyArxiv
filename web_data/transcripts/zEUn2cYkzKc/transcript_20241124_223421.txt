[Applause]
actually I spoke here at one of the
earlier sessions of this series uh
couple of years ago uh following
Amy and uh I've had that experience a
number of times it's a it's a very
humbling experience and really
unfair uh because uh the Instinct they
have is just to say you know I endorse
everything she said in this inspiring
way which I can't duplicate but this is
much worse this is really unfair I've
never had the experience of speaking
after one and Amy and that's hopeless so
uh I probably ought to just shut up but
I'll say a few words anyway
uh both of them brought up issues of
media I'll start by saying something
about that uh there is a uh very high
ideal that's uh celebrated by the
especially the elite media and that's to
maintain
objectivity objectivity has a very
definite meaning in media culture it
means repeating accurately anything
that's said within the Beltway if you do
that it's objective if you go beyond
that it's biased subjective you know
emotional and so on and so forth now
there's another concept reality and
objectivity and reality often don't
quite match in fact they quite often
there's a huge gap between them uh sort
of obedient by nature I'll start by
talking about objectivity and move very
quickly to
reality uh and I'll keep to having
trouble heing holding this can you oh
I'm sorry yeah see if this is better is
any better yeah okay oh okay that's all
right I'll hold it yeah sorry my voice
isn't very good uh the
uh I'll keep the foreign policy given
the you know the topic of the general
event there plenty to say Beyond and
you've heard a lot uh on uh foreign
policy there are some issues where
uh
where Conformity is so overwhelming
there's basically nothing to say uh
there's only objectivity namely
repeating what everybody says so for one
example which in fact was brought up was
uh President Obama's uh Global
assassination campaign the Drone
campaign that's pretty remarkable I mean
there are countries that have had
assassination campaigns PES Chile South
Africa had had one
uh's Iran had one Israel's had one for
years but there's nothing remotely like
the sophistication and scale of Obama's
campaign uh We've read a lot about it
and what's written about it is pretty
interesting as you know I'm sure the
decisions are made in the White House by
the president uh after having read
passages from St Augustine and discussed
them with
his you know Priestly advisor and uh I
won't tell you what the rules are you
know about them them uh and then they
murder anybody they like uh this is
there's a little discussion of this in
an interesting way there's a little bit
of a flicker of Interest over the fact
that they sometimes kill American
citizens so when they killed an American
cleric in Yemen AI there was kind of a
little talk maybe it's not nice to kill
Americans they also have to kill his
companion in the car is also an American
a couple Weekes later killed his son
16-year-old son also an American so a
little Rumble about that but killing
anybody else is just fine we
don't the only question is how much you
should do it uh there was there was an
interesting article in the times you may
have read it by Scott chain one of the
reporters who Expos actually presented
the White House version of how all this
is done with great pride and he said
yeah there's some moral questions but
the last line of his article was look
it's better than
Dresden which is true you know uh we
could do worse and
that's that's uh uh roughly the uh the
range of objectivity should we do
Dresden or should we do Global
assassination actually the same dis U
disparity shows up in the ndaa case
which I was a you know about I was a
plaintiff in it but I felt kind of
uneasy about it the NDA case was about
it it's focused on the fact that uh the
legislation that was passed and Obama
signed and he's now taking to a higher
Court to try to get enacted uh that
legislation allows the government in
principle to carry out preventive
detention without trial indefinitely of
American citizens and we're not supposed
to like that but what about anybody else
I mean this violates principles going
back to uh magnet Carta in
1215 which says that
no no one shall be deprived of Rights
without a due process of law and a
speedy trial by peers it's actually
written into the American Constitution
fifth and sixth amendments so that's all
being scrapped uh and it's okay but
there's a little question about
Americans why should we accept that uh
why should we even pursue it well this
is all Beyond discussion uh so here
we're just talking about objectivity the
same is true of something else which I
don't know if you followed but it's
worth getting your eye on uh one of the
new expansions of the
remarkable uh State that's being
constructed by the president president
is the disposition
Matrix uh it's a very interesting idea
uh there's a huge uh surveillance system
all over the world collecting huge
amounts of information about anyone the
government thinks might someday you know
want to do something we don't like and
you feed all of most of the information
you know that kind of informations I
mean not even worth laughing at whatever
it is it goes into make
major uh computer system which is U you
collecting enormous amounts of data and
it's somehow links up in ways that
haven't been explained yet to another
computer system which is collecting huge
amounts of data about
Americans and uh from this data the
government is supposed to call
information about who it wants to
dispose of that's the disposition
Matrix that's going to be nobody body
really knows there's no precedent for
this there's been a little talk about it
uh but uh uh only objective talk just
repeating the few words that are said
inside the Beltway well uh since I'm
talking about foreign policy uh here we
can there's a very easy way in this case
to uh give an objective account of of
the issues in international Affairs for
example you can look at the uh last
presidential debate uh if you can bear
it the uh uh Amy's forced to do it for
professional reasons but the rest of us
can skip it but as I'm sure you know
there were two
words in the presidential debate that
absolutely dwarfed anything else
overwhelmed everything else one word was
Israel the other word was
Iran uh Israel because each candidate
had to express their overflowing
adoration for Israel and everything it
does and incidentally for Obama this is
nothing new I wrote about him just using
his disgraceful web page before the
primaries in 2008 it was shocking um but
this time he had to you know exceed his
uh opponent who was also overflowing
with awe and duration so that's Israel
why Iran well two reasons one Iran is a
threat threat to Israel maybe even an
existential threat and two it's the
greatest threat to peace in the
world that's hammered in over and over
if you look at the media the next day uh
they were quite objective uh they
reported um calmly that Iran is the
greatest threat to peace in the world
you know after all that's objective
reporting
uh and this continues in in more
indirect ways so a couple days later in
fact the day before the election I take
a look at the New York Times it was full
page uh with
two topics in it the top story top half
of the page was about a u discussion a
debate that took place in the Israeli
cabinet uh couple years ago 2010 about
whether just go ahead and bomb Iran or
whether to wait and there's a discussion
of the debate and it uh it goes into the
pragmatic issues can you manage it can
you get away with it will it be hard to
refuel the planes the kind of thing one
was talking about and they finally
decided Well this isn't the time for it
the tone of the discussion is
interesting uh it uh there's been a
series of discussions like it couple not
long before the secretary defense Leon
Panetta was asked about Israel bombing
Iran he said well we we don't really
think it's a good idea but they're a
sovereign country so if they feel like
doing it it's their business we have
nothing to say about it uh what everyone
should do when you read that is reverse
it do a thought experiment Suppose there
was a report about uh an Iranian uh
meeting planning to bomb Israel and
deciding whether could get away with it
or whether it wouldn't work quite right
and so on would we have this reaction
actually you know what reaction you'd
have take the alleged comment by Ahmad
andad that one exposed is a fraud years
ago but it keeps resounding over and
over came back today it's too good to
lose uh that have to wipe Israel off the
map doesn't matter whether it's true or
false or anything it's good to use so we
use it I mean that's been a
major that non charge by a non-person
has been a major part of the propaganda
campaign against Iran suppose something
happened like what happened in the
Israeli cabinet well leave it to your
imagination the bottom half of the page
is about Israel uh there was a comment
by
uh abas
the which he's technically what he's
called the president of the pal head of
the Palestinian Authority actually isn't
but the U in which he made a comment in
which he said that uh he'd like to visit
uh the town where he was
born safet but uh he wouldn't want to
live he wouldn't want to go back and
live there and that caused a huge fur
different kind of furer in the midd East
and here the furer here was well maybe
this means that that finally uh Israel
and the United States have a uh partner
for peace which they've been yearning
for and striving for for years but
Palestinians are and Arabs generally are
so outrageous and impossible that
they've never been able to have a
partner for Peace So maybe there's a
chance now well let me say we a couple
of words about each of these uh cases of
uh uh objectivity so let's start with
Iran three questions should immediately
come to mind when you read that Iran is
the greatest threat to peace in the
world the first question is who thinks
so the second question is what's the
threat and the third question is if
there is a threat what should we be
doing about it okay so let's look at
those well who thinks so pretty simple
answer it's a western
Obsession most of the world doesn't
think so the non-aligned movement which
is most of the countries in the world
most of the people in the world by far
just had a one of their regular meetings
this one was in Teran and once again
they strongly endorsed uh Iran's right
to enrich uranium they harshly condemned
the sanctions and they called for a
nuclear weapons free zone in the region
I'll come back to that I don't think
there was a word about that because to
report it wouldn't be objective nobody
in the Beltway said anything about it so
it's not them well what about the Arab
world you know they're right there uh
that's an interesting case public
opinion in the Arab world has repeatedly
been pulled by the leading us polling
agencies and the results are interesting
they do see threats uh the two major
threats that they see are Israel and the
United States uh they don't like Iran
that's hostilities that go back forever
but they don't regard Iran as a threat
very small numbers regard Iran as a
threat in fact opposition to US policy
is so strong that in most of these polls
pretty high numbers think that the
region would be more secure if Iran had
nuclear weapons they don't want Iran to
have nuclear weapons of course but to
balance us and Israeli power maybe that
would be
better uh that to to report that again
would not be objective nobody says that
in the Beltway and you have to look
really hard to find the mention of it
found a couple of words in the
mainstream
press uh what you do see is something
different that the Arabs support us on
Iran that's heralded all over the place
in fact uh Wikileaks was interpreted as
saying that with big headlines about how
maybe Wikileaks is being run by the CIA
because they're giving such great
information and it's not totally false
but you have to ask who they're
referring to which Arabs Well turns out
the Arab
dictators uh some of the Arab dictators
support the US policy and if the
dictators support us and the population
overwhelmingly opposes us that means the
Arabs support us uh that teaches us
something about the how deep seated the
contempt for democracy is and the fear
and hatred of democracy and that shows
up right away in the Arab Spring uh
everything you read you know Thomas
fredman this morning or anything else
that talks about how much the United
States loves the the pressure of her
democracy and the Arab world it's
exactly the opposite pressure for
democracy in the Arab world is
terrifying if Ying to us leaders that's
a very Elementary reason just take a
look at the public opinion polls uh and
a DE to the extent that a democracy's
functioning public opinion has an
influence on policy so does the United
States want say Egypt uh to have the to
follow policies based on the idea that
the major threats they face are Israel
and the United States uh Iran isn't a
threat and Iran should develop nuclear
weapons to balance the US no they don't
want that uh so they have to be against
democracy and if you look at the actual
record you can see that that's exactly
the way it works I won't run through it
because there's no time but it's
straightforward however this is going
outside the realm of objectivity into
reality that's a dangerous step uh
that's the who question uh what about
the what question what's the threat uh
one what one said is
accurate I think and it's also it comes
from the most authoritative sources
absolutely most authoritative sources
the Pentagon and US
intelligence uh they
provide every year they provide an
analysis to Congress of the Global
Security situation of course a big
section on Iran and uh they talk about
the Iranian threat what they conclude is
um that Iran has very limited capacity
to deploy Force It has very low military
expenditures even by the standards of
the region I mean incomparably less than
us or our allies uh it has a strategic
Doctrine the doctrine is defensive to
try to deter direct Invasion long enough
uh for diplomacy to set in and they say
if and they don't know because nobody
knows they say if they're trying to
develop a nuclear capability what onean
was talking about that would be part of
their deterrent strategy and if you just
think about the geostrategic situation
which is obvious enough so obvious
enough I won't talk about it it's hard
to imagine a country that has a a
greater need for a deterrent it's almost
obvious so maybe they're doing it as
part of the deterrent strategy that's
the main threat there's a secondary
threat
they're destabilizing the region how are
they destabilizing the region they're
trying to extend their influence in
neighboring countries in Iraq and
Afghanistan so when we invade and
destroy the countries that's stabilizing
when they try to expand their commercial
political cultural influence that's
destabilizing well all of this fits
together and makes perfect sense on the
principle that we own the world so we
have to have a right to do anything we
want anywhere and that's a dominant
principle of policy not not just the US
it's the kind of policy that flows from
overwhelming power there's nobody's ever
been anywhere near as powerful as the US
is but you get similar uh
thesis measured by the level of power
that a state has we're kind of out of
sight so it's enormous and in fact one
of the most significant developments in
the world today is that while the US
still formally maintains the principle
that we own the world that uh and the
policies that flow from it the capacity
to implement those policies is
declining and that's causing tremendous
fear in the establishment as much fear
as you find in the white Community here
when they see that they're going to be a
minority pretty soon uh you can read the
Foreign Affairs you know main
establishment Journal a couple of months
ago front cover uh announcing the topic
of the issue big black letters is is
America over question mark because we
can't anymore fully implement the
policies of the last 70 years based on
the principle we own the world and this
is a common theme right through EST
lishment discourse well
that's that's worth thinking about too I
simply endorse what one said about it uh
well that's the what question so that's
who thinks is a threat and uh what the
threat is how about doing something
about it okay so let's assume for the
sake of discussion that Iran does pose a
threat okay what can you do about it the
threat is that they're allegedly trying
to develop nuclear weapons can you do
anything about that well there's
something very simple you can do one
thing you could do is follow the advice
of the non-aligned
movement uh move to establish a nuclear
weapons free zone in the region now
that's not new that goes back a long
time uh for the
last roughly 20 years Egypt in
particular has been pressing hard for a
nuclear weapons free zone in the in the
region goes back before that uh the
pressure is so strong that on the
regular nonproliferation treaty meetings
the US has been compelled to endorse it
Clinton endorsed it Bush twice go count
every five years Bush refused to endorse
it Obama endorsed it but added a
qualification it's a nice idea but but
not now and furthermore it has to
exclude Israel in fact it has to exclude
even any commitment to any country to
provide information about Israel's
nuclear weapons program meaning us so
great idea but uh this condition has to
be met first by accident that happens to
be Israel's policy their policy is that
wonderful idea but first we have to have
complete Regional peace peace and
everyone has to accept Israel's right to
exist and other things that can be put
off
indefinitely uh well okay that kills the
possibility of uh solving whatever the
problem is in a simple way now how could
that be changed it could be changed if
there was a mass popular movement in the
United States calling for implementing
this proposal but there can't be a mass
popular movement until somebody knows
about it at this point you look at uh
the objective behavior of the uh media
and here I think it's
100% I have not seen one word in maybe
you can find one in the uh mainstream
media even referring to this now that's
pretty striking because it's imminent
there's a conference coming up in a
couple of months in
Helsinki uh to try to move forward on
establishing a nuclear-free weapon Zone
uh Israel's already made it pretty clear
they're not going to attend the US won't
do anything unless pressed the media
with perhaps
100% uniformity which should be pretty
impressive even a totalitarian state
have refused even to mention it try to
find an exception well that's how you
could deal with it incidentally this is
not the only nuclear weapons free zone
in the world there are others that
countries have been trying to implement
one is in Africa the African countries
did agree to establish a nuclear-free
weapon Zone but they can't the reason
they can't is because there's an island
in the Indian Ocean Diego Garcia which
was a British dependency actually
belongs to African country but uh the
United States no
asked or ordered you pick it England to
kick out the inhabitants so that the US
could establish a major military base
it's one of the major military bases
that Washington uses for bombing the
Middle East and Central Asia uh and
Obama built that a base up much faster
he expanded it in fact to uh
to
accommodate nuclear sub Marine
submarines with nuclear tip missiles and
other ways expanded it enormously now as
long as that
base has nuclear weapons Africa can't
Implement its nuclear-free weapon Zone
there's another Zone in the Pacific the
Pacific countries have tried to
implement a nuclear-free weapon Zone at
first it was blocked by France 15 20
years ago because France wanted to carry
out nuclear tests in its specific
dependencies okay that's long over now
it's it's blocked by the United States
because the United States insists that
its Pacific
dependencies uh accommodate uh nuclear
weapons installations so that's another
possibility of expand of moving towards
the nuclear free world but Obama is very
uh you know has his wonderful soaring
rhetoric as it's called about uh but the
IAL one is the Middle East one and it's
also worth adding something else that
doesn't get reported but it's quite
important of all the countries in the
world the United States and Britain have
a unique uh obligation to move in this
direction for a very simple reason uh
you recall that when the US and Britain
invaded Iraq they tried to provide a
kind of a thin legal cover uh Iraq was
developing weapons of mass destruction
well we don't have to talk about the
outcome of that but that was the cover
and that went back to and they invoked a
security Council resolution from 1991
687 which called on Iraq to abandon its
nuclear weapons
policies weapons of mass destruction
policies you read that resolution and it
also adds a commitment by the signers to
move to a nuclear-free weapon Zone in
the region okay now that imposes a very
powerful obligation on the two countries
that carried out some of the worst
aggression in recent years on the basis
of that
resolution try to find a word about that
no okay that's how you can deal with it
in fact whatever the threat is there's a
very simple way of dealing it mitigate
it or ending it but can't happen unless
people know they can't know unless the
media move Beyond objectivity to reality
and incidentally it's not just the media
it's the media and the whole
intellectual Community it's not just the
United States it's the whole West a lot
of work to do on the major threat to
peace in the world allegedly well let's
turn to uh Israel and the United States
yearning for uh uh
negotiating negotiating partner in
Israel Palestine uh it's a very
interesting history wish I had time to
go through it but I'll just pick a few
of the points uh the issue of uh Israel
Palestine reached the international
agenda after Israel's conquest of the
occupied territories
1967 and the US did have a policy at
that time official policy uh the policy
was in accord with UN resolution 242
which everyone formally accepts at least
uh US policy was that uh Israel should
withdraw from the occupied territories
back to the international border with
perhaps minor and mutual
modifications so the international
border was in fact a ceasefire line so
okay straighten out the line here and
there that was US policy until 1971 w at
that point something quite significant
happened uh the president of Egypt Sadat
accepted a proposal from the
international negotiator to have a full
peace treaty from with Israel total
peace treaty everything a normalization
and so on if Israel would withdraw from
the occupied territories and in fact the
only part he really cared about was
Egyptian territory the Sinai actually
Jordan made a similar offer right after
so here was a possibility to
have total
security but without expansion there was
a choice are we going to have security
or expansion I think it's the most
fateful choice in Israel's history if
Egypt was out of the
conflict it's the only serious Arab Army
so okay you've got security um the
Israeli cabinet decided against
they were putting in motion plans to
develop the Sinai a big Jewish City on
the Mediterranean a lot of colonies and
so on the question is always is what's
the US going to do about it that's what
determines well there was an internal
debate in the United States the state
department was in favor of it it was
pretty much their program in fact but
there was somebody else
involved a character named Henry kinger
uh he was against it probably because he
wanted to take over the state department
uh it's probably internal bickering but
his policy as he said was what he called
stalemate no negotiations just force and
it was he assumed that others assumed at
the time that Israel was so
overwhelmingly powerful that they could
disregard the Arabs long story uh and
Kissinger prevailed and since that time
uh Israel back by the United States has
uh devoted its efforts International
efforts to expansion at the expense of
security Now this changed a little in 19
in the mid '70s
the official US policy and un 242 didn't
say anything about Palestinian rights
and nor did satat offer they were just
treated as refugees but by about 1975
that changed the issue of Palestinian
national rights reached the
international agenda and that caused
problems for the US in January
1976 a security Council resolution was
brought uh by Egypt Syria and Jordan the
main Arab states uh calling for a
two-state settlement on the
international border uh with a Jewish
State and a Palestinian State Israel and
a Palestinian State uh and then it
included U all the wording of un 242 so
with guarantees for the right of every
state in the region to exist in peace
and security uh within secure and
recognized
borders uh us vetoed it when the US
vetos a resolution it's a double veto
doesn't happen and it's vetoed from
history and objective commentators don't
refer to it so try to find some you can
find it's documented there's no debate
about the facts but try to find some
mention same thing happened in 1980 same
resolution this time Carter Vito it and
long story since I won't run through it
the most recent us veto in the Security
Council is actually did get a little
commentary because it was so outlandish
that's
Obama in February 2011 a resolution came
to the security Council calling on
Israel to live up to official US
policy official US policy the verbiage
you hear is uh don't expand settlements
this is a very minor issue incidentally
the issue is the settlements which are
totally illegal there's no question
about that not the expansion but the
security Council resolution was weak it
reiterated US policy and OB
Vito that's February 2011 that pretty
much ended any talk of settlement
expansion well quickly since there's
only another minute are there what are
the options there how do you deal with
the problem I mean of all the problems
in the world this may be one of the
easiest to deal with I mean it's always
called intractable impossible no
negotiating partner and so on it's all
perfect nonsense there's an overwhelming
International consensus includes
essentially everyone the Arab states
organization of Islamic states which
includes Iran the nonline movement
everyone uh calling for essentially the
U 1976
resolution one thing stands in the way
the United States of course Israel
doesn't like it but they can't do
anything like unless the US backs them
small country uh so it's in our hands uh
the US continues to block it the US does
call for
negotiations but take a look at the kind
of negotiations it's calling for they
have two crucial
preconditions one precondition is
they'll run be run by the United
States the United States is not a
neutral
party it's a
participant along with Israel and
blocking it this makes about as much
sense as proposing that Shiite Sunni
conflicts in Iraq should be mediated by
Iran um anybody said that it burst out
laughing but this is the same it's
saying that the major party that has
blocked negotiations for 35 years should
run the
negotiations the second condition is
that settlement expansion must continue
furthermore must continue even when it's
formally stopped you see reference es to
a 10mon stop and expansion but that's a
joke take a look at what happened all
sorts of devices were allowed to keep
them from expanding so those are the two
preconditions yeah let's have
negotiations that are run by the country
that's been blocking settlement for 35
years and let's ensure that the major
issue expansion of the settlement
continues I should say there's a lot to
say about Gaza of time but one thing is
crucial if you go back to the Oslo
agreements 1993 you know celebrated with
great
awe I won't go into what was wrong with
them but one crucial element in them was
that Gaza and the West Bank are a single
territorial entity its Integrity cannot
be
broken right away the United States and
Israel initiated programs to separate
them they're by now totally separated uh
if you're a Gaza is a kind of a cage you
can't get out of it but if a somebody in
Gaza wants to you know go to a college
in the West Bank visit their cousin go
to hospital and a West Bank
Hospital virtually impossible I mean you
can maybe find half a dozen cases where
it happened but essentially impossible
and people die in Gaza because they
can't get medical treatment because it
would mean that going to the part of
their territory which is one unit well
again objectivity doesn't allow
reference and discussion of this uh just
to summarize very quickly the two major
issues that the presidential candidates
debated uh the greatest threat to peace
in the world Iran and uh Israel's need
you know it's yearning for peace in our
efforts to try to bring it about uh
there's a response to those a simple one
uh the United
States in the case of Iran is
straightforward solution nuclear weapons
free zone it's not going to solve
everything but it's an important step
forward would reduce tensions it would
essentially eliminate the problem but
that can't
be uh implemented or even initiated
unless a large-scale popular movement in
the United States acts to compel the
government to do something about it and
that cannot happen if nobody even heard
about it if nobody even heard about say
the Helsinki conference coming up so the
media doing their job on that one and
the same is true of the second there is
a settle a at least temporary short-term
settlement of the Israel Palestine
conflict which again could reduce
conflict set in motion other things the
whole world is in favor of it except for
the United States and
Israel so we know exactly where the
problem is and that's a very optimistic
conclusion I think in both cases because
the one thing we can influence in the
world is the policies of this country to
the extent that it becomes a Democratic
Society and to the extent that we can
overcome uh what the founder one of the
founders of modern political science
Hans Morgan Thal called our conformist
subservience to those in power the
pathology of the educated
population
