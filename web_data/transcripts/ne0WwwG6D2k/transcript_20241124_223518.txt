how are you good to see you
something
nice down
that's
now just a few questions about the
political system um in elections uh you
uh sometimes suggest voting for uh
uh people who you simultaneously have
devastating criticisms of as a lesser
evil as something that is uh is the best
one can do in the short term um but then
there's also the problem of um of trying
to um uh build long-term institutions of
resistance including within the
Electoral Arena say for instance a third
party so the question is how do you
weigh the benefits how in your own mind
how do you weigh the benefits of um of
supporting a a uh liberal corporate
candidate who's much better than a than
the other um as against supporting a a
thirdparty candidate or a process that
is completely independent of that
Dynamic to make your choice I mean what
is it that's going through your head
when you come up with
that I don't I don't think there's any
formula that depends
un particular
circumstances like T say
2008 uh I happen to live in
Massachusetts it's a safe State you know
how it's going to turn out so I felt
free to vote for the green party which
at least is making some kind of effort
whatever one thinks about it to um
develop
a a lasting alternative
um if I was in a swing state say
Pennsylvania I probably would have voted
for Obama because I think it would have
been very dangerous in the short term to
have McCain and Palin in there um not
that I like Obama I think has not have
to say but other other times they just
haven't you know just kept away from it
didn't see any point in voting at all
sometimes there's a point sometimes
there isn't depends on the options
Alternatives so for example if Gore had
been elected in
2000 it's not obvious that we would have
gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq we
might have but not so
clear if uh McCain had been elected in
2008 we wouldn't just have
a a majority Ultra right in the court
we'd have an unbre unbreakable majority
so there are and there are many choices
like that first of all it's not a
highlevel decision I I think it's the
kind of it's like a 10th rate decision
that's a crucial Point yeah so other
things are way more important but you
know if you want us the 10 minutes
you're going to spend on this decision I
think there are a lot of you know
options to consider I mean the United
States is just not a functioning
democracy but in a functioning
democracy which which do exist in
Bolivia for example uh people vote but
that's just a break in an ongoing
struggle so you know you vote and you go
back to what you're doing uh in the
United States the way the thing is set
up is you're not supposed to be any
participation you just you know big
hoopla about the vote you know signs all
over the place you know work on getting
out the vote you push the lever and you
go home well that's a serious failure of
democracy so you want to try to overcome
that Democratic deficit as is sometimes
called the lack of functioning democracy
it's pretty striking how how it's been
achieved in the United States in fact
the very concept of democracy is almost
non-existent I so take say uh
primaries I mean let's imagine you had a
functioning
democracy with our own institutions I
mean our institutions you know they
could be Democratic it's not that
they're are inherently
undemocratic uh so political in
political institutions you have uh say
the New Hampshire Primary in a
Democratic Society what would happen is
uh you the people in a town in New
Hampshire would get together in their
own organizations assemblies groups
whatever they are and take off a little
time from whatever political and other
activities they're engaged in and say
okay let's work out what we would like
to see in the next election and they'd
come up with some sort of program we'd
like to see this then if some candidate
says I would like to come to town to
talk to you uh they would say well you
can come if you want to listen to us and
the candidate could come and they would
explain to him what they want and then
they would say if you can give a
convincing reason why you'll support
these things we'll consider voting for
you or maybe we'll have our own
representative we don't care about you
uh that would be a functioning democracy
and what happens is totally different uh
nobody meets in the town the candidate
and his PR representatives and so on
announce that he's coming to her she
sometimes is coming to a town in New
Hampshire and you know they kind of were
gather people together and the people
sit there and listen to the candidate
saying how wonderful I am and I'm going
to do all these great things and nobody
believes a word and then they go home
well you know that's the the opposite of
democracy and in fact we see it all the
time I mean take say April
15th I mean in a functioning Democratic
Society that would be a day of
Celebration the day hand in your
taxes you would be saying okay we got
together we worked out some plans and
programs that we think ought to be
implemented and we're now participating
and you know providing the funding to
get these things done that's a democracy
in the United States a day of
morning uh it's a day when this Alien
Force you know the government which
comes from Mars or somewhere uh is uh
arriving to steal from us our
hard-earned money and use it for their
own purposes whatever they are that's a
reflection of the fact that the concept
of democracy is kind of like not even
the people's minds I'm kind of
exaggerating it's not quite this
sharp pretty
it's a very great success you could
discuss in a similar fashion the voter
turnout or the reasons why people vote
who for who they vote for so voter
turnout what do you think take voter
turnout I mean there's a lot of effort
to get voter turnout and uh people go
for all kind of reasons I mean sometimes
the reasons are quite interesting like
take there was an election you know
which people regard as having a
startling result in Massachusetts you in
uh January senate senate
election which gave uh the Republicans
What's called the 41st seat Well that
concept alone is interesting uh the
there's two formal political parties in
the country Democrat and Republican uh
the Republicans have lost any pretense
almost of being a traditional political
party they have almost no policies I
mean the policy is no to whatever you
produce they're kind of like the old
Communist party and that uh party
discipline is almost unanimous almost
everything is unanimous they haven't had
you
know 40 votes they had now they have 41
almost invariably unanimous doesn't
matter what the issue is maybe
appointing Somebody To You know some
post in the bureaucracy so it can
function uh the Democrats who are kind
of there are groups called moderate
Democrats they're pretty much the ones
who used to be called Liberal
Republicans uh they the party alignment
has shifted so that the Liberal
Republicans and the traditional usage
have been essentially expelled from the
party and they've switched over and
become what are called moderate
Democrats meaning Republican
old-fashioned
Republicans uh so the moderate Democrats
sort of go along with the Republicans on
a all sorts of things and then there are
the Democrats that are called Left
almost entirely kind of
Centrist Pro business Democrats couple
of stragglers U now they've all agreed
to require a super majority on
everything that means that majority rule
can be blocked and is blocked if uh
unless you have a super majority and the
technique that's used is the filibuster
well the filibuster had been around for
a long time was occasionally used it's
now the puster has now become kind of
like the signing statements I mean they
had existed in the past the signing
statements are when a president says
okay I'll sign this legislation but I'm
not going to follow it for this and that
reason there had been such cases but
with bush 2 it became something totally
novel I think there were more signning
statements than in the preceding 42
presidencies it just became routine and
Obama's picking it up
and the filibusters become the same it's
just a way to for
this party discipline party of no uh to
insist on a super majority for anything
in fact it got to the point
where one Republican senator Shelby just
announced he's going to hold up every
presidential nomination I think 70
nominations routine nom
nominations uh and of course he asked
for some special gift for his State
unless you meanwhile they're saying out
of the other side of their mouths we
don't like pork but unless you give me
this gift I'm going to hold up every
nomination and that works with a party
that um keeps the party discipline you
know okay so Brown the guy elected in
Massachusetts he was the 41st vote that
means even a super majority won't work
now the vote has been it was it was
described as being uh you know kind of
like a popular Rebellion against the
government the leftist government taking
over that's not what happened what
happened was quite interesting uh first
of all u a flood of money poured in
toward the end from the financial
institutions and that's for the reason
we already discussed uh Obama had
started making some mild noises about
the greedy bankers and so on and
part of the reaction was to say okay you
talk like that we're going to eliminate
your super majority so money a lot of
money poured in if you look at the
voting which was you know the data were
published within a couple of days uh
Brown the Republican one primarily for
two reasons the affluent
suburbs uh he were very much engaged and
very supportive of brown so they're
condemning Obama because although he's
giving him a lot he's not giving him
enough so we want even more that's the
affluent suburbs the urban areas which
are mostly Democratic you know working
class poor voting was very low and they
were essentially telling
Obama you're giving everything away we
don't even want to bother with you we're
not going to take part particularly
interesting was the union
vote uh there was was lower than usual
but the majority of the union vote went
to
Brown and it's been discussed in the
labor press the good labor press like
labor notes you know they interviewed
people and union leaders and so on the
uh the working people were just furious
about the Health Care Program now you
know it's it's portrayed as a critique
of The healthc CARE program in fact
people don't like the health care
program but because it doesn't go far
enough like considerable majorities of
the general population certainly Obama
voters even more were in favor of a
public option Medicare Buy in other
things which Obama just canned so they
don't like it because it didn't go far
enough that's the majority of the
population not exactly what the
headlines say uh but in the case of the
union leaders activists working people
in unions they were Furious because
Obama has been willing to give up
everything practically except for one
thing on which he's been assist
insistent namely taxing them for their
health care
plans it's called the taxing it's called
an excise tax on Cadillac plans I mean
Cadillac plans are not what rich people
get it's what working people have
succeeded in eeking out of their
employers through the Union in tradeoff
for giving everything else away so part
of the tradeoff in the class war is in
the unions and this is a bad error of
the unions from way back is to give up
on almost everything but at least to get
some benefits for your own people not
for others just for your own it's one of
the reasons we don't have a National
Health Care Program is because of the
focus of the unions on ourselves not
others like very different from Canada
same unions but in Canada the same
unions insisted on healthcare for
everybody in the United States they kind
of bought into the corporate system and
said okay healthcare for us the result
is that unionized workers get pretty
decent you know by us standards pretty
decent healthcare plan
okay Obama wants to and the thing he
insists on he give away everything else
he insists on taxing him pretty heavily
so of course union workers are Furious
so they voted for brown they're shooting
themselves in the foot but uh yeah but
the Voting is understandable but you
can't I mean the blame for the irony so
to speak really is the real left I mean
the anger is Justified the anger is very
the the willingness to sort of rebel and
get upset is Justified it's perfect ly
sensible there's just no Avenue that
does anything except make it worse yeah
and that's generalizes over the country
so you know been saying for some time
and other people have too it's it's a
serious mistake for the left to make fun
of the Tea Party Movement and Sarah
palen and the rest of them I mean it's
easy to make fun of them a lot of it's
just kind of comical and ridiculous but
that's not the point uh what we should
be doing is ridiculing ourselves not
having a better I mean these are people
who ought to be organized by the left
most you know there's all kind of groups
like there's militias and you know black
helicopters and so on but uh I think at
the core of it it's just legitimate
grievances you know these are people who
worked hard all their lives done
everything they're supposed to their
lives are they're being shafted they
have been for 30 years you know wages
have stagnated
declined benef you know services are
collapsing they never were very good
schools are lousy
you what's happening to us you know why
is this happening to me well they I mean
they get an answer from say Glen Beck
you know the rich Liberals are picking
over everything they don't care about
you and they want to give it away to
illegal immigrants and so on and so
forth all right that's a coherent answer
when you listen to them it's an
internally coherent answer it says
something so okay they accept it uh the
liberal Democrats aren't going to give
them an answer they're going to say this
is happening to you because for the last
30 years we've been working with a
corporate system to de-industrialized
society and enrich bankers and so on
we're not going to hear that you know
and the left is just not telling them
anything or it's trying to but it's not
doing it that's extremely dangerous it
kind of has a whiff of the late viar
Republic to
it and so ridiculing it doesn't make
sense so it's like the union workers in
Massachusetts sh shooting themselves in
the foot as became clear right away I
mean as soon as brown was elected he
managed to get in super fast with the
help of the so-called moderate Democrats
in time to help vote down uh an
appointment for the National Labor
Relations Board which is the one
pro-union relatively pro-union
appointment that was likely to get into
the nlrb nlrb since Reagan has just been
it used to be at one point some device
for you know supporting workers rights I
me it's almost eliminated but if you
eliminate you know the last pro-union
person gets worse so when they were
voting for brown that's in fact what
they were voting for but that wasn't
what was in their minds what was in
their minds was anger at Obama for
insisting on one thing namely taking
away their health
benefits but
if you go back to the late 60s and you
come all the way forward we're talking
40
years uh in those 40 years there's been
a left there's been leftists there's
been people who are critical of all
these things that you're talking about
and yet they if we are honest about it
haven't produced an awareness or a
mechanism or pretty much anything uh
that that speaks to the broad population
even at a moment when it is furious and
it is I rate at the government at
employers at at Wall Street and so on
and so forth so either we've been doing
something wrong or it's hopeless I mean
if we've been doing everything right and
gotten to the place where we are that's
not a very good sign it would be much
better if we had if we made mistakes if
we have have uh you know failed to
operate as well as we should have and
therefore there's things that can be
done so the question arises um
in in trying to to improve the political
system and in also in trying to just
raise political Consciousness and
therefore activism in Broad
populations what do you think um should
have been done or hasn't been done in
these domains or shouldn't have been
done that was done in other words what
mistakes or what failings do you think
are responsible for the mess that we're
in well I'm the left such as it is does
talk about these issues but it's uh on
the left is just a conglomeration of uh
very a lot of people count NOS as a lot
of people but very scattered and issue
oriented so there's a part of the left
that's dedicated to gay rights there's
another part that's dedicated to
environmental issues there's another
part that's uh concerned with nuclear
weapons I mean you know aggression or
whatever it may be there's a whole lot
of issues but they tend to be kind of
separated there's no you can't really
identify an organized left that's
addressing the kinds of concerns that
the general population very rightly has
so what part of the left has been
talking constantly clearly to the right
people about the fact that the
financialization of the economy from the
70s has led
to stagnation BAS basically of real
wages and incomes and deterioration of
limited benefits and so
on in fact a large part of the issue
oriented
left uh unfortunately has
alienated this population I mean we may
not like it but the fact is that a large
part of that population is racist is
sexist you know opposed to gay rights
and so on and while working on those
issues is correct it's got to be done in
a way which recognizes the reality of
the audience that is out
there all right moving on to one of
those areas uh race in America racism
you've already talked about it to a
certain extent
um what is race what is race and racism
I mean it just what is
it well we know what it is is I mean
it's a first of all you know race is I
me here the postmodern is is sort of
right it's a social construction and we
decide that there's different races you
can a lot of different ways you could
categorize people we do it by you know
color hairstyle or whatever it is uh and
uh it's um it's a deep strain in
American history you know goes right
back I've talked about it goes right
back to slavery never really changed but
it's real and
uh it shows up very strikingly in
people's attitudes people's attitudes
are quite different from what is usually
claimed there's good one of the things
that political scientists do pretty well
is study popular attitudes in extensive
polling and they publish straight and
interesting results actually the current
issue of the main political science
journal political science court early
happens to have a an article reviewing a
lot of poll studies on attitudes towards
social justice issues and the results
are pretty interesting I it turns out
that contrary to what is commonly
claimed the population is basically kind
of Social Democratic in their
attitudes so and in fact the most
interesting part is the author
identifies the people who call
themselves anti-government you know
right-wing libertarian get the
government off our backs so that kind of
thing so just looking at their
attitudes they tend to be in favor of uh
more aid for more federal spending for
education for health for uh helping poor
people you know for Social Security you
know pretty much the same things that
liberals would say uh but there's an
exception two exceptions they think
we're giving too much to blacks and
we're giving too much to people on
welfare well like it has no relation to
reality but we can see where it comes
from now it comes from unremitting
propaganda that's based on traditional
racism you know the blacks are getting
everything they're taking our country
away from us and on the sort of U
reaganite type uh you know extremist
propaganda about the welfare you you
know the black mother and her Cadillac
coming to steal your money at the
welfare office all right you have enough
propaganda like that and you you get
this split in attitudes now notice I'm
talking here about the people who regard
themselves as anti-government you know
rightwing the general population it's
similar but less striking in a way and
that shows up on other things too
actually when you ask people they didn't
happen to in these polls but it's been
done before what do you think you ought
to give to so
poor mothers with dependent children of
course it's more than we it's it's way
more than we actually do that shows up
on foreign aid too regularly you ask
people what do you think about foreign
aid they say we're giving everything
away to those undeserving people who are
ripping us off what do you think we
ought to give them like maybe 10 times
as much as we do you know so you and
these are failures of the left too you
know you're supposed to educate
people but it what I think it means is
that the audience is there and people's
General attitudes are kind of more or
less Social
Democratic okay what about in parallel
questions
of sexism plays a big role and there's
it's one of the real achievements of the
60s actually the post 60s movements I
mean issues were raised in in the 60s in
an interesting way I mean a lot
of a lot of people know way more about
this than I do but from what I could see
um a lot of the I think the feminist
movement really took off in the 70s and
later and part of it at least was a
result of sexism in the left yeah I mean
you know I I remember from the
resistance movement it was very striking
you know the women were supposed to you
know write
the hand out the leaflets and so on in
fact it was even ultr seex in some cases
and the men the resistors were doing
something difficult and dangerous and
courageous and uh at one point by the
end of it they were kind of being told
look you guys are oppressors that was
very hard for a lot of people to take I
it led to real breakdowns here we are
courageous moral doing something really
hard turns out we're oppressors it was
psychologically quite difficult but I
think out of that came at least one
strain of what became the feminist
movement there were others and it took
off and there have been a lot of changes
I mean there's a lot of problems but uh
country is very different from what it
was in the 1960s in this respect I you
can see to places like say MIT I mean
like when I got there in the
50s MIT was white males you know
well-dressed
deferential you know uh working on their
whatever it was particularly their
professional concerns uh if you walk
down the holes now it's half women maybe
a third minorities um informal dress
informal relations a lot of activism
they're scattered like everywhere but
you know booths here and there doing
this that and the other thing okay those
are
changes we've already done some ecology
stuff uh do you believe global warming
is occurring largely made largely human
made and susceptible to human correction
I have to ask the question because of
course there's a growing number of
people who would say no I don't have any
particular technical expertise but uh I
don't see the slightest reason to doubt
the uh evidence that's been presented or
to question the overwhelming consensus
of
scientists it just so yeah I take it for
granted and that it's anthropogenic and
substantial measure then we have the
followup pretty obvious question how do
you understand and the seeming
willingness of government and of those
people who are in position to actually
by virtue of their own activity affect
what goes on in the world Rich powerful
people to uh to just permit the likely
Calamity or at least watch it occur um
my my feeling is that U say CEOs of
Corporations like ex onmobile or general
elector or whatever they have about the
same beliefs as you know college
professors on most things um so yeah
they know it's happening and they don't
really question it uh and there is a
kind of a standard answer which is not
totally false uh that they're
concentrated on more short-term problems
so yes they have to make sure the bottom
line is good enough next quarter or else
they lose their salaries and that sort
of thing uh that part is true but it
doesn't go deeply enough uh you go
deeper gets back to what we were talking
about before this is part of a market
economy I mean we don't really have a
market economy it's kind of like a quasi
market economy but there are Market
elements in the economy and among those
Market elements is you simply have to
pursue short-term interests or else
you're out somebody else will pursue
them I mean like Suppose there are say
three car companies uh you know for
the General Motors and Chrysler let's
say let's imagine they're comparable and
suppose one of them say GM says okay I'm
going to devote resources to making
better cars 10 years from now okay they
not going to be around 10 years from now
that's the way market systems work to
the extent that there is limited
competition as there is you are
compelled to focus on short-term gain uh
and advantage over others or else you're
just out of the game in fact in the US
legal system it's a legal requirement
for the CEOs so yeah as part of the
quazi market system we have you're just
going to have to avoid these things and
economists have a word for it it's
called externalities you sort of put in
the footnote uh and it's true of every
transaction well it's also I mean the
more extreme version is I'm going to pay
I meaning the head of whatever it is
General Motors I'm going to pay
attention to the fact that what we do
influences global warming that's paying
attention to something that affects
everybody else my profits go down I'm
out of business no I can't do that you
know I'm in the financial crisis is a
perfectly good example but I could want
to do that and not do that but if I do
that I'm out I mean like take say the
financial crisis I mean now the you know
big economists talk constantly about the
systemic risk we didn't pay enough
attention to systemic risk yeah of
course not you can't you know in fact
this was pointed out years ago I mean
like 10 years ago two pretty well-known
economists you know John eatwell and
Lance Taylor uh wrote a book called
Global Finance at risk and basically
what they pointed out is that uh because
systemic risk isn't considered it's an
externality uh you just there's got to
be a catastrophe I mean that means
you're underpricing risk there's more of
it than you should take
uh and so yes of course it'll crash and
then there's other factors like perverse
incentives and so on and so forth but
it's just like built into the system yes
if say you and I make a
transaction maybe you sell me a car or
something I mean if we got our brains
functioning we'll uh try to make a good
deal for ourselves but we're not paying
attention to the effect on somebody else
like congestion and pollution and gas
prices going the system that's not the
nature unless the system includes that
which markets don't one of the very
well-known inefficiencies of markets
like every student learns it in freshman
course then you forget about it this
explains why the CEO powerful people in
the economy regardless of their desires
personal desires they may be horrified
by global warming um can't do anything
to deal with it but there's something or
can't do anything in that domain and
what they do is interesting like take R
petroleum which is considered you know
very Progressive in this respect what
they're trying to do is to buy into the
alternative technology Market figuring
okay that's going to be a profitable
market so we'll work on SOL collectors
there is one other evidence so take for
instance a company that years back has
somebody at the head of IT who's
anti-racist um he can't in fact hire
blacks in the United States at a higher
rate than they're getting because once
again he's now you know depressing so
even though he desires to do it the
market prevents him from doing it
because other people people won't do it
and he'll be outcompeted but the
government could then pass a law saying
you have to saying you have to so what
they'll do is move what they'll move is
move their production to Mexico and then
to China and so but you know there's
there's actually pretty interesting
study I mean Tom Ferguson's work which
is some of the best work I know on
political economy uh what he's for
example he did a lot of studies on the
New Deal and it it's something that
shows up elsewhere too what he found is
that during the New Deal uh Rosevelt and
the new deals we're getting pretty good
support from a particular sector of
Industry uh high-tech internationally
oriented industry like Swope head of GE
was quite strongly New Deal on the other
hand they were passionately opposed by
lowtech labor intensive domestically
oriented industry and it's for just this
reason you know say for General Electric
you know Capital intensive
uh okay they want a disciplined
Workforce they want disrupted so and
it's not a big expense for them so okay
we'll have unions uh they're
internationally oriented so they wanted
the export promotion policies of the No
Deal for manufacturing industry it's
quite the opposite labor costs make a
big difference they don't want the labor
force unionized they don't care much
about International Trade so you get
this uh difference of political support
we still come back to the government
because the government is in is is
slightly different um not to say there
aren't constraints on it but it is still
slightly different and I could certainly
imagine maybe it's naive but I could
certainly imagine a President Obama um
or others you know it doesn't matter who
McCain anybody um um marshalling the
office the bully pulpit and everything
else to scare the beesus out of the
country on global warming um you might
not in other words that might be
manipulative Etc but you can imagine
them doing it and you could imagine as a
result a powerful upsurge which would
then create a context in which
corporations are you know sort of the
the market Dynamic is overwhelmed and
and you get some results but they don't
seem to be doing it it did happen pix
alore he tried he tried and he was
smashed he became denounced as a liberal
elitist out of touch he takes jet planes
you know uh the point is they're always
strong counter forces and inform is one
of the easiest things to do you can make
up lies as much as you want and you can
make people look ridiculous and so on if
you have enough Clouts so okay that's
what happened uh yeah it could have
worked but it you know it would require
a lot of popular organization actually
Rosevelt did it to a limited extent but
he did it but he had a mass popular
movement behind him you know the the
labor movement really did organize and
there were plenty of other movements the
country became pretty radical so yeah he
had a basis for going after the bankers
and so on and instituting some
reasonable legislation you know glass
Eagle Social Security Wagner Act and
others not
trivial all right that's a offshoot
question you're not a vegetarian right
do you think there's a moral case for
vegetarianism and do you think it might
emerge I think there's a moral case for
it and you know ton of letters that come
to me about it uh but uh Ian there's a
moral case for a lot of things
like there's a moral case for the fact
that if you look at deaths from
starvation human deaths uh among
children forget everyone else among
children alone deaths from starvation or
starvation related diseases are about
twice the level of
Rwanda not 100 days but every day okay
that's a problem uh now you can say well
let's deal with both and mention a
thousand other problems let's deal with
them all well you have time and energy
happen to be finite which means you have
to pick and choose you can't do
everything out of the question so you
have to set priorities and say in this
case uh suppose I have a choice between
devoting my I could pick 20 other cases
let's pick this one suppose I have a
choice between devoting energy and
effort to writing books about and you
know giving talks about and so on uh
trying to save the children which is you
pennies a day there ow nothing to it
very little effort to save the uh to
stop the double Rwanda style killing
among children every day and there's a
choice between that and essentially
carrying out Mass genocide of
domesticated animals because that's what
vegetarianism means uh it's an effort to
reduce animal suffering but the fact of
the matter is that suppose we all became
vegetarians the first thing you'd have
to do is
eliminate almost all domesticated
animals because they're well they're
raised to eat for eating meat that's why
we have know cows chickens sheep you
know so on and so forth so somehow you
got to get rid of them that you can't
just let them reproduce and proliferate
or you know first of all I'll starve to
death if you don't feed them so it'll be
genocide anyway uh so there is a big and
that's that's one of the immediate
consequences of vegetarianism they can
pretend I don't notice but it is so okay
these are things to balance the does the
the fact that a significant number of
seemingly and presumably really
well-meaning
caring sensitive
people uh put huge amounts of time
into concerns
around animals and not into concerns
about humans strike you as one more one
more indication of the failure of the
left because they basically feel maybe
we can succeed on this front this
front's hopeless they can't succeed on
that yeah but they think that no look I
don't want to CR criticize particular
people actually my own children for
example vegetarian one one of them's
vegetarian the other's semi-vegetarian
okay they made their choices that's fine
choices I'm respect it they do other
things which are great you know and
people can make those choices and maybe
a sensible choice in their own lives
maybe they can spend time I'm not really
talking about that I'm talking about
people who are animal rights activists
who are devoting time and energy and
organizing to that their priorities I
said my priorities we all have to do
that uh I think we can understand each
other's reasoning we may have different
judgments about how priorities are to be
ranked another thing that you will
encounter as an organizer is that person
who will feel that the deck is stacked
that it's just impo that that what you
do has no efficacy it has no possibility
of succeeding and and they will again
try to argue from history saying well
look there's crime there's torture
there's poverty there's
recycled forms of Oppression um no
matter what you do it's like rolling a
rock up in the hill eventually it's
going to come down and Crush you so why
bother uh and that's what a great many
people who will say who will be honest
enough to admit okay situation is
oppressive okay people maybe are capable
of something more but City Hall is too
strong to fight you know the state's too
strong how do you deal with that it's
history doesn't tell you that what
history tells you is that a lot of
things have been overcome it wasn't easy
it wasn't complete there's always
problems there's regression but lots of
things that were considered entirely
acceptable not long ago are considered
totally outrageous now we can run
through the list it's pretty easy now if
you want to say some somebody suppos
somebody comes back and argues and say
well now it's different it's much
harsher well that's plainly untrue it's
much easier now the forces of repression
that exists now are nothing like what
they were in the past uh there's a leg
we have a legacy
from people who have struggled to make
things better and we're a lot free more
free we're more free we've got a lot
more opportunities uh State repression
exists other kinds of repression exists
but nothing like in the past I it's
extremely unliking now that say the
government could carry out anything like
say Wilson's red SCAR or even co-intel
Pro which is not that far back I they
can do things but they've lost the
ability to use force and We Know It And
they know it I mean that's in fact one
of the main reasons for the development
of the public relations industry and
modern system propaganda I mean systems
of power knew and recognized and in fact
said you know or say a century ago that
they are mostly the more free countries
like England and the United States that
they have essentially lost the capacity
to control people by violence uh so
therefore they'll control them in other
ways uh actually that even shows up in
the uh and and the other ways to do it
is by controlling opinion and attitudes
so huge industries develop to do that
actually it even shows up in just the
financial
institutions you they take a say a
standard you know academic history of
you know financial institutions Barry
ien green one of the main economists
economic historians he's very straight
about it he says of course Market
systems
impose if they let the Run free you know
in financial Market systems they're
going to impose tremendous burdens on
people a lot of people are just going to
suffer badly you know crashes and so on
but in the 19th century this wasn't much
of a problem because they couldn't do
anything about it but then he goes on to
say with the increase and I think he
calls it politicization of the masses
you know the forming of parliamentary
labor parties and unions and so on and
so forth it became harder to impose on
the population the costs of Market
systems so in after the second world war
when a new global system was set up the
Britain wood system canes and uh Harry
Dexter white what they did was
Institute uh control over Capital
control over Capital movement and
control over speculation fixing
currencies they introduced them as a way
of compensating for the inability to uh
uh distribute the costs of markets
systems to the public this reduced the
costs and it did that's why we had a
couple of Decades of huge growth and
Equitable growth and so on it was very
straight I there happens to be a corer
that he didn't
add uh and the but you can't add and
that is with the breakdown of this
system in the
1970s with the financialization of the
economy yeah you're getting the costs of
uh financial markets distributed over
the public again and something's going
to have to be done about it but yeah
that's a you know a lot of U thinking
goes into this and there are shows
there's a lot of results
that Mak
work my upper back is
you
know I could
