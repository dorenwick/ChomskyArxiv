[Music]
[Applause]
thank you uh well uh let me uh begin
with a few words about the choice of
topics actually that list over there is
quite a good choice and I'll pick a few
of them uh it's no uh it's no great
Insight that we live in a world of
conflict and
confrontation and that one crucial
element of it is a class War uh class
war has lots of dimensions and
complexities but in recent years the
lines have been drawn uh very
sharply uh to oversimplify but really
not too much uh on the one side there
are concentrate concentrated power
centers uh State and private uh very
closely linked uh on the other side is
much of the population
worldwide uh and though one can't
estimate with any Precision I think it's
fair to guess a large majority of the
world population that's in any way
involved in U able to become involved in
issues of broad significance uh which
requires a degree of privilege of course
uh concentrated power
uh they pursue their um War relentlessly
they never stop they use every
opportunity to press their agenda
forward in the harshest possible way uh
in particular they use crises so an
earthquake or a war or September 11th in
its aftermath uh and in such
circumstances you can expect and you
discover uh that they will exploit the
atmosphere of fear and anguish and
concern and they hope that their popular
adversary will be distracted uh Focus
attention elsewhere uh be frightened
while they continue to pursue their
programs U without U any pause in fact
increasing them using the window of
opportunity uh and that's what's
happening right now uh the adversary
should of course refuse to accept this
cynical frame work uh it should focus
its efforts also relentlessly uh on the
primary issues which remain as they were
before the latest crisis uh the issues
include uh the threat of militarism
which is indeed a threat to the survival
of the species at this point and a very
far-reaching assault uh against
democracy and freedom which is part of
the core of the neoliberal program of
the past 20 25 years well those are the
things I'd like to talk about uh
everything of course is open for later
discussions so I don't feel constrained
by that uh well I though that is what I
want to talk about I can't really bring
myself to turn to those topics without
at least a word on the uh immense human
tragedy that is unfolding before us
right now and is being uh planned and
implemented very consciously uh by the
United States and its allies since
September
11th uh the uh um High Commissioner of
human rights of the United Nations Mary
Robinson she was not exaggerating when
she uh pleaded with the United States to
stop the bombing uh and warned that if
it continued there would be a Rwanda
style Slaughter in fact fact she may
have been
underestimating uh according to us
estimates uh the number of people at
risk of
starvation which was about 5 million has
increased by 50% since the bombing
started that's 2 A5 million people who
are uh uh being put uh pressed right
across the border of death uh from
starvation uh Mary Robinson's appeal was
of course rebuffed it was also
unreported uh literally it received
three s scattered sentences in the
entire us press uh other appeals from uh
High un officials um Aid agencies and
others were similar ones uh were not
even mentioned uh on September 16th it's
just 5 days after the terrorist attacks
in New York and Washington on September
16th the US demanded uh of Pakistan uh
that it terminate Food Supplies to
Afghanistan uh the country has been on a
kind of a lifeline and as one Aid worker
um said afterwards we've just cut the
lifeline uh the decision on September
16th to cut Food Supplies was a decision
a conscious determined decision toh
starve several million people to death
uh there was no reaction to that uh the
next day it just happened I was on radio
and television around Europe mostly
Europe National radio and television uh
no one was aware of it or could think of
a single reaction in their own country
there was no reaction in the United
States uh so apparently it's considered
entirely normal for Western Civilization
uh to make a decision to kill 2 and a
half million people in the next few
months uh and that shouldn't surprise
anyone who's familiar with history it is
in fact normal which is why there is no
re reaction to the silent genocide
that's
underway uh the uh un food and
agriculture organization FAO uh already
before the bombing they had warned that
if the threat of bombing itself had
driven out the aid agencies and driven
people out of the Cities into the
countryside in fear and Desperation uh
and they warned that a humanitarian
catastrophe was taking place uh after
the bombing began they reported further
that about 80% of the crops uh plantings
had been disrupted uh which means that
uh what is being planned is a even more
severe famine for next spring uh the
bombing
itself um has turned major cities into
ghost towns about 70% of the population
is fled the bombing as in other cases
Iraq ser ibia uh the bombing is directed
against uh Power stations U electrical
supplies Water Supplies sewage and so on
that's a form of biological warfare
that's exactly what it means to do that
in a urban area uh the U population
that's fleeing uh either they flee to
borders which are mostly closed or they
most of them flee into the countryside
uh in the countryside they're heading
into um areas which is the most heavily
mined in the world uh 10 to 20 people uh
uh there 10 to 20 uh deaths or injuries
every day even in normal times many of
them children uh that increases sharply
now for one reason because the United
Nations has been compelled to terminate
its mine clearing operations for another
reason because the mines are now
superseded by much more lethal weapons
uh namely U the
cluster bombs uh from the US bombing
these are anti-personnel weapons which
uh they're designed to murder people
they don't affect tanks or buildings or
anything like that uh uh little things
that somebody will pick up a child will
pick up or a farmer will hit with a hoe
and then it explodes and sends Flett
that tear them shreds uh and they're
extremely hard to dismantle and some
areas where they've been used like
Northern La um in what was then the
heaviest bombing in history in isolated
peasant Society uh it's still littered
with millions of cluster bombs um
hundreds or thousands of people killed
every year uh no Dem mining efforts U
the manufacturer says that 20 to 30% of
them don't explode which can mean only
one of two things uh either U incredibly
incompetent quality control or else a
purposeful uh concern to murder
civilians you can take your choice uh
well all of this is happening uh without
essentially without comment uh because
in a way it is kind of normal that's
what the West has been doing to the rest
of the world for hundreds of years uh
but the Millennium is beginning uh with
uh two monstrous atrocities the terrible
terrorist crime of September 11th and an
even worse atrocity that's following it
namely a purposeful conscious program of
mass murder uh which could have uh
excruciating dimensions and while this
is
regrettably normal business in Europe
and and its offshoots it's kind of
remarkable to see that a country like
India which has been subjected to this
torture for hundreds of years and you
might think would have some appreciation
for what it means
is nevertheless enthusiastically joining
the bandwagon but that's your problem uh
these U accumulating cars uh bear very
directly on the question of the people's
right to information it's extremely
important to ensure that that right is
denied so what I've just said although
it's not really controversial is almost
totally unknown in the United States
there wouldn't be a person in a million
who would be aware of this and there's a
good reason for that if if uh people did
have the slightest idea of what's being
done in their names there's no doubt
that there would be Mass protests and
that policies would have to change uh
the United States is very free country
it's uniquely free I think the most free
country in the world with regard to
right to information and the task of
suppression of that right is not
undertaken by the state they may try now
and then but they're pretty
ineffectual uh the task of depriving the
population of the right of information
uh that is the solemn duty of the
intelle intellectuals of the educated
classes which you're trained for when
you go to a good University uh and of
the Free Press it's their task to ensure
that the right to information is denied
that's why things like this remain
unknown you can't carry out Mass
genocide if the population
is aware of what what is being done and
when these controls break down you do
get strong popular
reactions uh well we're now living
through this is not the first case by
any means we're now living through an
illustration uh which is so shocking
that uh words fail at least my words
it's not novel we should be aware of
that it's not restricted to the United
States and Europe it goes back through
history uh uh as does the role of the uh
the priesthood either religious or in
modern days secular priesthood well with
these hopelessly inadequate words on a
crime that we should be working day and
night to try to bring to a quick end uh
let's turn to the topics at hand
uh uh perhaps the best way to approach
them is within the framework of this
fashionable notion of
globalization uh but before doing that
uh it's important to clarify what it
means um and like most terms of
political discourse it has a literal
meaning and a kind of a technical
propagandistic meaning in the literal
sense globalization just means
International integration here mostly
economic
integration uh and that's neither good
nor bad you know it's uh justice trade
is either good nor bad it depends what
its human consequences are can be
carried out in many different ways uh
the uh uh that's the general meaning the
specific meaning that's in fact used uh
and enforced by concentrated power uh
the term globalization refers to a very
specific form of international
integration one which has uh uh been
implemented with considerable intensity
in the past 25 years
approximately and which is designed in
the interests of private concentrations
of power the interests of others are
incidental they may gain they may lose
it doesn't really matter uh fact of the
matter is most of them lose but that's
just kind of a
consequence U
sorry uh I'm told that people in the
back can't
hear is that true can you hear me back
there yeah I don't know what to do about
it much but I can't yell any louder
uh well uh that's the technical sense of
uh globalization and with that
ridiculous terminology uh in place the
great mass of the people of the world
who object uh can be labeled anti-
globalization so they must be
primitivists who want to go back to the
Stone Age uh and are uh resisting
inevitable forces they they want to harm
the poor and all other terms of abuse
that I'm sure you're familiar with uh
opponents of globalization I think make
a very great mistake if they accept this
framework of power and agree to call
themselves anti-globalization uh no one
sensible is opposed to International
integration uh Le least of all the left
uh the left has been animated by a
vision of globalization since its
Origins uh uh the whole vision of the
left has been
internationalism International
solidarity and cooperation
globalization uh that's certainly since
it's modern Origins and there have been
very important strides in this direction
uh many achievements in recent years uh
uh and we should be committed to that we
should be committed to far-reaching uh
globalization but but uh designed to uh
improve the lives and opportunities of
people uh the people of the world and
the people of future Generations that's
a task that uh cannot be put off these
aren't empty words the possibilities for
moving forward are very real uh they are
Illustrated in many ways uh the by now
annual meetings at Porto Allegre in
Brazil are a important expression of
this they bring together a very broad
pardon they bring together a very broad
International
constituency um Brazilian workers uh the
landless workers movement North American
unionists environmentalists peasant
movements women's rights activists very
wide range of people who in the past
have had nothing much to do with one
another they went in separate paths but
now thanks to a constructive uh form of
globalization that we ought to try to
advance and in fact that is the
traditional vision of the left are
moving forward in in ways that uh are
impressive that uh in part they're
defensive defending themselves against
attack but in part quite uh constructive
uh working on ways to dismantle
concentrated Power Systems to extend
popular control uh worldwide well that's
the form of globalization that should be
pursued at least by uh people who want
uh to create a world in which a decent
person would want to live uh the
specific form of globalization that's
being officially pursued is quite
different that's called as you know
neoliberal that's also highly misleading
uh it's not new and it's by no means
liberal that should be obvious in India
if it isn't more than any other place
this is the whole history of India for
the last several hundred years uh
classic example of how liberalism can be
distorted uh into an instrument of power
and destruction and the current version
of the neoliberalism is similar to what
destroyed India uh with a combination of
imposed liberalization on India and the
massive state power and protectionism in
the Imperial power uh and the current
version adopts that traditional
double-edged uh doctrine of liberalism
and free trade uh the doctrine is uh
it's fine for you so that I can demolish
you uh but I'm going to insist on the
protection of the nanny State and other
devices uh uh to make sure that I'm
protected from the costs of Market
discipline except with with one
exception uh when the to use the usual
term when the playing field is level
which means when it's tilted so sharply
in my direction uh and in my favor that
I'm confident that I can win uh in that
case I'll favor free trade uh the fact
that the uh new versions adapt the
traditional ones to current
circumstances that shouldn't be very
surprising actually it's exactly what
you expect if you look at the designers
uh the designers are the few richest and
most powerful states uh the
international financial institutions
that are that follow their directives
and an array of uh huge corporations
Mega corporations which are tending
towards
oligopoly uh anti-market principles in
most sectors of the economy uh and are
heavily reliant on the state uh on the
state sector which is very dynamic in
the rich and powerful countries like the
United States reliant on the state
sector to socialize cost socialize risk
privatize profit and to maintain the
dynamism of the economy that's the real
world economy it's quite different from
what you study in a economics class uh
the designers of the system uh modestly
call themselves The International
Community uh but uh maybe a more
appropriate term is one that's used in
the uh in the business press major
world's major Business Journal the
London Financial Times uh described them
as the Masters of the
Universe uh that was uh last January
when they were meeting in Davos
Switzerland to organize the world uh
maybe that was intended as ironic I
don't know but it's accurate uh the
Masters of the Universe uh profess to U
be admirers of Adam Smith so you might
expect them to abide by his description
of their behavior uh although he only
called them masters of mankind uh but
that was before the Space Age
remember uh Smith uh was referring to
those who he called the principal
architects of policy in England uh
merchants and manufacturers as who as he
put it uh attended to their own
interests uh carefully uh and made sure
that they were satisfied no matter how
Grievous the effect on others uh
including the people of England but
incidentally primarily India he wrote
with particular anger about the savagery
of the English in India in Bengal
particularly uh he U point
he um stated that the principal
architects who are ensuring that their
own interests are attended to very well
they follow what he called the vile
maxim of the Masters of mankind uh
namely all for ourselves and nothing for
anyone
else uh that's an accurate description
of the Masters of the Universe who
follow their model not noticing that he
was denouncing them not providing a a
model for them uh in subsequent
developments over time that would have
appalled Adam Smith or any other
classical liberal uh there has been
these uh huge concentrations of power
which are basically tyrannies have been
assigned by the courts uh the rights of
persons Immortal persons uh the courts
have proceeded to attribute the rights
of persons to corporate management uh
that's true in the United States and I
think elsewhere
uh in recent agreements mislabeled trade
agreements uh in these recent agreements
the rights of these private tyrannies
have gone way beyond the rights of
persons uh so for example General Motors
can demand Under World Trade
Organization rules demand and receive
what's called National treatment in
Mexico uh they have to be treated as a
national company on the other hand if a
Mexican of uh Flesh and Blood tried to
obtain National treatment in New York U
it wouldn't last very long if he could
even make it that far uh so the
corporate entities The Immortal persons
have rights by now far beyond human
beings they're strange kind of person
apart from their uh massive scale and
immortality uh the uh uh the recent
agreements give them even further right
so by now it's possible and these rights
are being explored and implemented uh
for corporate entities to U uh uh to
undermine
regulatory U legislation in States
United States Canada others um on the
grounds that these regulations are what
is called tantamount to
expropriation that is if a state the
country regulates a well to take a
recent case that was one uh a US
Corporation wanted to um uh deliver
toxic wastes to in Mexico to store
somewhere in Mexico the people of the
state in Mexico objected uh they didn't
want toxic weights stored there uh and
they turned the area into a national
park the corporation uh metal clad uh
charged Mexico with actions that are
tantamount to expropriation because that
infringes on future profits of the
corporation and they won uh they won in
a world a NAFTA hearing finally a
Judicial hearing and the judicial
hearing was correct because the NAFTA
rules do permit that uh this is uh under
a imaginative Doctrine called regulatory
takings any regulation is a taking of
people's rights meaning corporate rights
because it might reduce their future
profits well you know those are rights
that no person of flesh and blood can
think of but they're U granted to these
totalitarian institutions that dominate
the International System the Masters of
the Universe uh well um these uh uh this
is simply one part of what in fact is a
very dedicated assault against popular
sovereignty which means democracy uh
which is expected to become more severe
uh in the Western Hemisphere there are
now plans I'll come back to this for a
free trade area of the Americas there
was a summit of the countries of the
Western Hemisphere last April in Quebec
plenty of disruption and violence uh and
protest uh uh it was Kept Secret the
plans are being kept secret uh nobody
knows in any detail what the plans are
for the free trade area the Americas uh
and it's uh uh important to assur that
it remains secret because if it becomes
public uh opposition will be
overwhelming I'll come back to that in
interesting exercise and thought control
in a free
Society uh well the crucial point is
that the public has to be kept unaware
uh that's been true all along uh NAFTA
is now set North American Free Trade
Agreement 7 years old to this day the
Press has refused to publish uh the
official position of the labor movement
on the form that NAFTA should have
should take that's now 1992 almost 10
years uh they've also refused to publish
the analysis of NAFTA that was given by
congress's own research Bureau the
office of Technology assessment which is
very much like that of the labor
movement uh the reason is that it was
critical of the form of international
integration that was being imposed by
the Masters of the Universe uh and
therefore the public better not know
about it because if the public does know
about it the already over you know
majority opposition to NAFTA would grow
substantially as people came to
understand that their own CR individual
criticisms were in fact well grounded in
substantial institutions uh and a very
important central part of the neoliberal
reforms is to reduce the threat of
democracy in this and in other ways well
that's very much a lie I mentioned that
the one
participant in the class War uh always
exploits every opportunity uh to
Institute harsh and aggressive measures
uh with unrelenting intensity that's
happening right now uh they're telling
their victims that they have to be
subdued and acquiescent uh out of
patriotism uh on the other hand
patriotism does not prevent the Masters
of the Universe from using the
opportunity to say uh uh give new tax
breaks to Enron to mention a company
you've heard of around here uh to
increase the uh military budget
substantially while nobody's looking uh
to uh even to Institute um what's called
FastTrack legislation it's interesting
the U us trade representative Robert
zolik um immediately after the September
11th bombings announced that the best
way to combat terrorism is to implement
FastTrack legislation uh what is
FastTrack legislation well it's
legislation that turns the United States
into the Kremlin under Stalin uh it's
literally uh the legislation uh grants
the Executive Branch the right to
negotiate International treaties in
secret uh with no Congressional
participation and of course no public
knowledge and then Congress is allowed
to say yes that's the degree of public
participation so that's FasTrack legis
isation it's often called free trade
legislation and that's not entirely
untrue uh you couldn't pass legislation
uh that's mislabeled free trade if the
public had any participation so it has
to be done Kremlin style uh the U uh but
out of patriotism you're undoubtedly
Osama Bin Laden will just be shaking in
his boots if this legislation is passed
it's such an obvious attack against
International terrorism well that's the
kind of thing that it makes sense to
press through when you have a window of
opportunity and the general public can
be uh if they can be induced to keep
quiet uh out of so-called patriotism or
fear or whatever uh this does all of
this does raise a question it's been
very obvious uh over the past years that
opposition to corporate lead
globalization is overwhelming across the
world that's been particularly dramatic
in the South where the main opposition
developed uh it later spread to the
north where it becomes harder to ignore
so you know reaches Seattle you can't
pretend it's not happening uh and it
does raise the question why there is
such massive public opposition in the
United States in England everywhere else
uh it seems paradoxical because
globalization socalled uh is we're told
that every day has led to enormous
Prosperity u in the United States
particularly it's led to a what's called
a fairy tale economy uh just to give one
quote from the extreme left of the
admissible Spectrum Anthony Lewis in the
New York Times uh writing last March
said that uh it has created the greatest
boom in American history economic boom
in American history in fact the greatest
economic boom in world history so why
are people opposed uh well it's admitted
that it has some flaws not everyone is
participating in the Glorious experience
and since we're good-hearted people
especially the left we have to be
concerned about this and we have to
worry about these people who lack the
skills to join us in participating in
the greatest economic boom in world
history uh and that also poses a dilemma
uh why is it that this enormous Pro
erity that's developing and leading to
fairy tale economies is also leading to
inequality what do we do about that uh
well that picture is so conventional
that it takes a bit of a wrench to
recognize that is entirely false in
every respect except one the one respect
that is true is it's leading to Great
inequality everything else is totally
false and uncontroversially false uh the
economic boom in the United States in
the 90s was per capita economic growth
was about the same as Europe uh it's
much less than it was in the pre
globalization period uh the period
before the neoliberal reforms of the
1970s it's vastly less than it was
during World War II which was the
greatest economic boom in American
history under a semi- command economy uh
so the question is uh how can the
conventional picture uh be so different
from absolute Ely uncontroversial fact
uh well the answer is very simple and
you know it very well in India a small
sector of the society has in fact
benefited enormously and that sector
happens to include the people who tell
everybody else the wonderful news uh and
they're not being dishonest you can't
accuse them of dishonesty they have
every reason to believe what they're
saying they can read it every day in the
journals for which they write uh
furthermore that's exactly what they see
around them you go to an elegant
restaurant or The Faculty Club or you
know the editorial office or wherever
you hang out that's what you see people
who are enjoying a fairy tale economy so
there's no reason to doubt it uh uh the
only it's only the world that's somehow
different who knows about that uh let's
take a quick look at the historical
record on this uh economic integration
globalization in a neutral sense that
increased very rapidly in the half
century or so before World War I it
leveled stagnated between the two Wars
then it began to pick up again after
World War II by now it's reached a level
which is more or less comparable to
about a century ago in Gross measures
but only gross measures if you look at
the fine structure it's quite different
in interesting respect uh prior to World
War I there was much more International
integration at the level level of people
that is movement of people was much
Freer and those of you who care about
free trade may recall that uh free
circulation of Labor is the foundation
of free trade according to oldfashioned
radicals like Adam Smith uh so movement
of people is cut back a lot by state
regulation uh on the other hand U the uh
free flow of short very shortterm
speculative cap Capital that's mov risen
to astronomical levels Way Beyond
anything in the past and that difference
reflects the central features of
contemporary globalization it expresses
the relative value of people and capital
capital has priority people are
incidental and notice that that's
exactly the opposite of classical
economics Adam Smith and David Ricardo
they insisted that
people should be mobile and capital
should be immobile uh everyone's heard
of Adam Smith's invisible hand uh and
how wonderful it is but not many people
have apparently read the one passage in
Wealth of Nations in which he mentions
the phrase it appears once and it
appears in the course of an argument
against Capital Mobility uh he argues
that the Invisible Hand will prevent
This Disaster from happening uh somehow
rest uh the uh uh there's other
interesting differences I'll come back
to some of them uh there is also a more
technical definition of globalization
globalization is measured by convergence
to a single Market to single price and
wage around the world well that's
exactly the opposite of what's happened
uh it's gone exactly in the opposite
direction led to enormous inequality so
there's a theory on one side and there's
a real world on the other side and
that's expected to continue the US
intelligence services with recently put
out a document of projection for the
next 15
years that means there'll be less
globalization in the technical sense but
more globalization in the doctrinally
approved sense Rich wealth for the rich
Financial volatility of course means
slower growth so the best scenario best
possible scenario is even slower growth
and much less globalization in the
technical sense meaning more
globalization in the sense they like uh
military planners adopt exactly the same
assumptions there's now a vast expansion
of armaments going on primarily in the
United States uh since September 11th
it's been escalated using the window of
opportunity uh and there's a reason if
you look at the planning documents uh
past years they predict make the same
prediction they predict that
globalization is going to lead to an
increasing divide between a small number
of Hales and a large number of have not
uh notice opposite to the economic
theory but consistent with reality uh
and that raises a problem it's a problem
that has the technical name enforcing
stability stability means you do what I
tell you or else you know uh and it's
hard to enforce stability when you have
a growing mass of hav knuts who are
disruptive and unpleasant and you know
do bad things uh accordingly it's
necessary to have a huge expansion of
the military the United States is
already far in the lead in conventional
forces and weapons of mass destruction
actually it outspends the next 15
countries but that's not enough it has
to move to a new frontier space has
hasn't been militarized yet uh that
requires a violation of the outer space
Treaty of 1967 which has been observed
that's prevented militarization of space
uh that the United Nations is aware of
this in fact the world is aware so the
there's been a reaffirmation of the
outer space treaty every year for the
last couple of years uh and it's passed
almost unanimously with two abstentions
uh the United States and Israel probably
next year India
uh the uh uh is equally enthusiastic
about joining the race to Destruction
for reasons you can explain to me uh the
uh un conference on
disarmament um has been stalled all year
uh for the same reason they're trying to
put a restriction on militarization of
space the US blocks it all of this is
unreported none of this appears in the
American press for the same reason it's
not wise to allow citizens to know of
plans that put the survival of the
species at risk at serious risk uh uh
escalating the arms race to space is in
fact the core program and has been for
years it's not just Bush of the
militarization uh expanding what's
called an arms race to space although
race isn't a very good term for it since
the United States is racing alone for
the moment though there are others eager
to join like India for example won a lot
of respect from Hawks and jingoists in
the United States for its enthusiasm
about this which is unique in fact uh
the uh plans to cross the Last Frontier
to militarization of space are disguised
as missile defense ballistic missile
defense now anybody should understand
that when you hear the word defense you
think offense any offensive action is
always called defense uh uh and it's
pretty straight in this case the goal of
ballistic missile defense is to place
offensive weapons destructive offensive
weapons in space and the goal is very
frankly expressed it takes real
discipline for the educated classes to
keep people from knowing this it's all
in public documents you can read them on
the Internet you know uh very Frank and
clear uh for years uh the goal is the US
space command documents explain that the
goal is to uh M obtain Global dominance
hemony they call it and the purpose is
to protect I'm quoting all these quotes
to protect us interests and
Investments uh and they give a history
they say that in the past countries
constructed armies and Nate navies to
protect and enhance uh commercial
interests uh but now there's a new
frontier we can cross uh we can have new
initiatives that'll take the next step
in protecting and enhancing commercial
and investment interests namely
militarization of space now this is
known to be extremely threatening
there's no question about this because
of the predicted reaction among
potential adversaries or for that matter
because of what are called normal
accidents in the technical literature a
normal accident is the kind of accident
you know is going to take place in any
complicated system you just can't tell
when
that's called a normal accident uh and
what's being planned are systems of
great complexity uh weapons of very high
destructive power much more than nuclear
weapons
laser uh weapons which are extremely
destructive powered by nuclear power
which itself is extremely dangerous in
space uh and on a hair trigger alert uh
with automated strike on Warning Systems
because you can't take any chances if
anybody starts shooting down your
satellites your system is gone so you
have automated systems of massive
destructive power uh which are sure to
undergo normal accidents uh and
therefore wipe everyone out uh but U
it's and could be stopped nobody doubts
that it could be stopped namely by
treaty uh but it's just to stop it would
be inconsistent with the prevailing
value system the prevailing value system
is that hegemony is much more important
than survival uh and that's not new uh
in fact it's the history of hundreds of
years years uh the uh change now is that
the stakes are far far greater uh well
come back to globalization The crucial
Point here is that this is motivated uh
by the expectations for globalization
it's expected to lead to a widening
divide meaning failure in the technical
sense but success in the doctrinal sense
and that requires space-based weapons of
mass destruction uh targeting the
growing numbers of hav knots
uh that globalization is expected to
produce uh and severely raising the
threat to survival and it's all very
rational and within the framework of
kind of a lunatic set of Institutions
it's totally rational well let's return
to the greatest economic boom in
American and world history uh remember
that this was written before the crash
before the fiscal bubble crashed early
this year uh so at a time when it really
looked fantastic uh since World War
2 there have been two pretty sharply
different phases in the world economy
there was a phase called the Britain
Woods period from shortly after the
second world war into the early
1970s uh and then there's the neoliberal
phase that followed it when the Britain
Woods regulations were broken down
Britain wood system in the first period
was based on regulation of capital so
regulation of capital flow States could
regulate outflow of capital and inflow
uh and currencies were fixed pretty
closely to one another uh and that was
terminated in the 7s well that these two
periods it's the second period that's
called globalization though in fact
International integration preceded more
quickly during the first period but
remember this is a technical sense of
globalization neoliberal globalization
uh these two phases are quite different
uh economists uh commonly refer to the
first phase the Breton Woods phase pH as
a golden age and to the second phase the
neoliberal phase as a leaden age uh and
in fact if you look at standard
macroeconomic statistics that's exactly
what you find they all declined
considerably during the globalization
period that's true of rate of growth of
uh growth of the economy rate of growth
of productivity capital investment in
fact even trade trade has declined
during the globalization period
uh the U interest rates have gone way up
because countries have to especially
countries of the South have to protect
their currencies from Attack uh that
slows down growth the financial
volatility increased and many other
harmful consequences well let's return
to that profound dilemma that everyone's
worried about uh how what are we going
to do about the fact that we have this
enormous Prosperity uh resulting from
globalization but it's leading to
inequality
well there's no dilemma there's nothing
to answer there's no Prosperity uh in
fact globalization has reduced
Prosperity even by standard
macroeconomic measures uh which are
highly ideological but even by those and
it's not controversial uh many
economists uh attribute U the decline in
the economy severe decline during the
globalization period uh to
liberalization of capital uh you can
debate that so little is understood
about the international economy that
causal relations are hard to establish
uh but the correlation is very clear and
down down to fine detail in fact uh
however there's one thing that is clear
uh namely Financial liberalization does
lead to an attack on Democracy that's
not controversial in fact that was the
reason the primary reason why the
framers of the Breton Woods agreement
back in the 1940s insisted on Capital
controls and regulation of currencies
they understood that that would provide
some space uh within which countries
could pursue Social Democratic policies
welfare state policies uh without being
overwhelmed by market forces that would
prevent it it's the only way to protect
that that was well understood and that's
quite true uh free Capital movement
creates what's sometimes called a
virtual Parliament a parliament of
investors and lenders uh who have V to
power over government decisions uh
sharply restricting Democratic options
actually I'm quoting from technical
papers in the economics literature uh
free Capital movement creates what's
called a dual
constituency namely voters that's one
constituency and investors and lenders
that's the other constituency uh and the
investors and lenders conduct Moment by
moment referendums on government policy
they don't like a policy because it's
harming them they veto it by withdrawing
capital from the country or attacking
the currency and of course the second
constituency the uh investors and
lenders they Prevail first constituency
can't compete with them and that's true
even in the rich countries and
furthermore that's well understood uh
and that's one of the most striking
differences between the current phase of
uh globalization and the phase before
World War I U let me just quote
from uh sorry Stan a little technical
but this is the standard uh history of
the International Financial system by a
highly regarded uh American Economist
Barry ien green uh he points out that
before World War I uh government policy
had not yet been politicized by
Universal male suffrage and the rise of
trade unions and parliamentary labor
parties therefore the very severe costs
of U Market discipline Financial
rectitude they could be imposed the
costs that are imposed by the virtual
Parliament they could be transferred to
the general population because he didn't
have this
politicization uh notice that logic is
exact same as structural adjustment in
the poor countries you impose the costs
on the poor and they can't do anything
about it that's the way it was in the
west um 100 years ago but that luxury
was unavailable uh under the more
democratic Britain Woods period after
the second world war there were there
was Universal male suffrage in
parliamentary labor parties and unions
and furthermore the U the world
population was very radical at that time
been greatly radicalized by the war and
there was enormous popular support
including the United States for welfare
state programs and therefore it was
necessary to do something and what ien
green points out is that limits on
Capital Mobility substituted for limits
on Democracy as a source of insulation
from Market pressures which is quite
true uh the limits on Capital Mobility
allowed democracy to function couldn't
uh and he doesn't follow the argument to
The Next Step but we easily can
dismantling of the Britain Woods
agreement should lead and has led to a
sharp attack on substantive democracy
just as you'd expect uh particularly
striking in the United States and
Britain which are in the lead on this
but in fact
worldwi uh well this attack on Democracy
is a very significant feature of the
second phase globalization phase uh of
the post-war world and there other
components of the Washington consensus
have the same consequences the basic
idea of neoliberalism is to shift
decisions soci socioeconomic decisions
to unaccountable concentrations of power
that's a essential feature of the
neoliberal
reforms uh but remember the powerful
State remains to protect the Masters
they require it uh this extension U the
U attack on Democracy is being
negotiated right now in secret as always
uh at the uh gats negotiations General
agreement on trade and services in
Geneva uh what is a general agreement on
trade and services well what are
Services services are anything that
could be within the public Arena so
Education Health um welfare Water
Resources communication anything like
that that's Services uh there's no
meaningful sense in which they're
privatizing these is trade in Services
that's just it's called trade so you can
put it under the trade agreement uh if
you privatize these government services
you can have a perfectly functioning
democracy and it will do nothing because
nothing is left in the public Arena uh
so privatizing Services which is what
these negotiations are about essentially
eliminates from the public Arena
anything that might be virtually
anything that might be U subject to
popular decision making uh that's called
trade and services and naturally have to
negotiate that in secret to the extent
that anything leaks out about it there's
huge public uproar actually the
importance of protecting the public from
information was revealed very
dramatically at the April Summit of the
Americas uh every editorial office in
the country in the United States had on
its desk two major Publications which
were timed for release at the summit uh
one was by Human Rights Watch main human
rights organization in the world uh a
second was by the economics policy
Institute which is a major you know
economics
analysis Institute in Washington both
studies investigated in depth the
effects of NAFTA on working people in
three countries the United States Canada
and the uh uh
Mexico uh now NAFTA was presented at the
summit as a tremendous Triumph that's
what George Bush said and the headlines
read and it should be a model for the
free trade area and it's very easy to
see why these both studies were totally
suppressed didn't appear anywhere and
it's easy to see why uh they the Human
Rights Watch report uh presented
extensive detail about how labor rights
were harmed in all three countries all
three countries
the economic policy Institute report uh
studied in detail how the conditions
wages working conditions Etc of working
people were harmed in all three
countries uh demonstrating that this is
one of those rare trade agreements which
succeeded in harming everybody uh in all
three countries at least apart from the
people who count they did fine um I
don't how much time I have somebody tell
me how much time I have I lost track
pardon keep going all right tell me if
I'm going on too long because I lost
track uh if you look at the effects on
Mexico they're particularly instructive
for countries like India or for any
place in the South and there the effects
of NAFTA were particularly severe uh in
fact Mexico began the neoliberal reforms
about 20 years ago and uh wages have
declin steadily since that time that
continued after NAFTA with a 25 %
decline for salaried workers and a 40%
decline for the self-employed and that's
an underestimate because it doesn't take
account of the fact that the number of
unsalaried workers increased greatly uh
so the actual effects were even worse
than that this includes the Maduras the
foreign owned manufact assembly plants
uh foreign investment grew after
NAFTA uh big headlines no headline for
the fact that total investment declined
uh so foreign investment went up but
domestic investment way down and the
total Decline and the economy was
transferred into the hands of foreign
multinationals uh the minimum wage lost
50% of its purchasing power
manufacturing declined development
stagnated may have reversed uh meanwhile
trade between the US and Mexico did
increase uh however the component of
trade that is internal to a firm that is
centrally administered by a totalitarian
system that uh increased from a half to
2/3 now that's called trade by
economists but it's not trade in any
meaningful sense you know it's not trade
if you if General Motors mooves
something to Mexico to be assembled and
sends it back to the United States to
sell uh if you discount that trade
actually reduced between Mexico and the
United States uh these studies actually
confirm what had been reported in the
business press and academic studies I
won't go into the details because I
guess I am running out of time but it's
essentially the same story uh and very
familiar around the world uh agriculture
uh suffered a particularly severe blow
for the usual reasons U Mexican Farmers
uh can't compete with highly subsidized
us Agra business U with effects that are
familiar throughout the world actually
most of this had been predicted by
critics of NAFTA but they were wrong in
one respect and me too uh most and and
me too anticipated that there would be a
sharp increase in the urban rural ratio
uh after NAFTA as hundreds of thousands
of peasants were driven off the land
okay that didn't happen the urban rural
ratio remained the same the reason is
that conditions deteriorated so badly in
the cities that there was a huge flight
of people both from countries side and
City to the United States and those who
survive the crossing many do not uh work
for very low wages no benefits under
awful conditions the effect is to
destroy lives and communities in Mexico
but that's not counted when you measure
effects of things uh uh and it improves
the US economy uh one study that with
Wilson Foundation points out that
consumption in the United States is
subsidized by impoverishment of Farm
Workers both in the United States and
Mexico so it's a benefit for the economy
for the health of the economy well these
are among the costs of NAFTA and Ne
liberal corporate globalization
generally but those are costs that
professional economics chooses not to
measure that's a choice you could
measure those if you wanted to they're
called externalities we don't count them
uh but even by the highly ideological
standard measures which dismiss these
these costs have been very severe and
from what I've read I understand the
same is true in India well none of this
was allowed to disturb the celebration
of NAFTA uh and the Free Trade Agreement
at the summit of the Americans and in
fact unless people are connected to
activist organizations they cannot know
any of this I mean they know it in their
own lives you know or in the lives of
the people near them but they can't
can't know that this is General in fact
one effect is to make people feel like
failures uh here there's a fairy tale
economy out there but my income is
declining and the people around me work
harder and so on so there must be
something wrong with us uh in fact us
happens to be almost everybody so for
about 75% of the workforce uh wages uh
have stagnated or declined over the last
25 years the globalization period in the
richest country in the world and the
only way income are kept up is by
increasing working hours uh ordinary you
know midle median American you middle
the American uh working class what are
called middle class Americans work about
a month extra a year Family just to keep
wages stagnant that's the highest
workload in the uh u in the world uh
well that picture generalizes around the
world there's some
variation uh the uh
the main exception are countries uh
which I'm quoting now which did not
follow the religion that the markets
know best I'm quoting from the latest
Nobel Prize Laurette in economics Joseph
stiglet uh in an article he wrote just
before he was appointed uh Chief
Economist of the World Bank uh a
position which he did not keep very long
because he kept making such annoying
statements he was kicked out
uh but what he said is correct the
countries that didn't follow the
religion that markets know best uh did
succeed in growth extensive growth
During the neoliberal period almost
everywhere else it was pretty much what
I've just described worse for countries
like Mexico than for the United States
uh uh furthermore this is expected to
continue you know the if you look at the
provisions of the World Trade
Organization uh they deprive countries
of exactly the mechanisms that were used
for development uh all of them are
Market interference without exception
there isn't a single Rich developed
country that didn't rely crucially on
extensive Market interference I that
holds from England uh up to the East
Asian Knicks and the United States
dramatically uh if the United States had
followed the principle of comparative
advantage uh the
rules that the poor must accept under
contemporary
neoliberalism uh the United States would
now be exporting fish uh it would
certainly not be exporting textiles the
only way it could develop textiles was
by extremely heavy protectionist
barriers that kept Superior British
textiles out actually the reason Britain
was producing textiles is because it did
the same thing to India it imposed heavy
uh duties to keep Indian textiles out
not just
textiles ships steel manufa iron
manufacturer all sorts of things because
they couldn't compete uh then when and
meanwhile India was compelled to follow
liberal rules became what's called an
ocean of liberalism uh by economic
historians and the results are obvious
countries like the United States the
United States couldn't have developed a
steel industry for the same reason
British steel was Superior just as
Indian iron had been Superior to British
iron a century earlier and it was
changed the same way and that goes right
up to the present uh often a military
cover is used for this the dynamic
source of the US economy is under the
cover of the military system it's a
massive State sector of the economy that
includes just about everything the whole
new economy you know Electronics uh
computers inter internet in fact
telecommunications it just go through
the list it's developed under a military
cover uh and if you look at the World
Trade Organization rules you'll notice
that they have a way of dealing with
this uh you're allowed to what's called
a national security exemption so you're
allowed to violate the rules for
National Security okay for Haiti that
doesn't help a lot but for the United
States it helps quite a lot because it
includes the whole economy uh the whole
economy can be developed within a
national security exemption by placing
it under uh you know The Cutting Edge of
it under the military and that's exactly
what's done uh you can hear you know
Alan Greenspan telling about the wonders
of the entrepreneurial economy and
rugged individualism and so on and he
even gives list examples of these things
you take a look at the examples every
single one of them without exception was
developed in the state sector uh
extensively over a long period period
and it's inconceivable that he doesn't
know this I mean this is common
knowledge but it's again not the kind of
thing that U not the kind of information
that people have the right to uh
well uh the you take a look at economic
history all of this is just dramatically
clear just ask yourself the simple
question which countries develop well
the countries that developed were Europe
North America Japan a couple of the
countries in the Japanese Colonial
system and that's about it uh the rest
of the world not only didn't develop but
it was pretty much destroyed uh there's
a characteristic in common to the
countries that develop they maintained
their sovereignty they were not
colonized uh and the correlation is
extremely close you don't find
correlations like that in history
countries that maintained their own
sovereignty and were able to violate the
rules uh and integrate themselves into
the economic system on their own terms
many of them did develop countries that
lacked sovereignty uh uh were subjected
to external control without exception
did not uh develop again it takes a lot
of discipline for economists and other
intellectuals not to notice this fact
it's quite striking uh under the U
contemporary versions of uh and I should
say this understates this completely
understates the reality so takes a you
know the beginning of industrialization
everywhere is
textiles uh Britain succeeded in
developing textile industry by
destroying the superior Indian textile
industry and by protectionist devices
and state intervention uh but
uh textiles were based on cotton and
cotton was cheap and why was cotton
cheap well cotton was cheap because of
an institution called slavery uh slavery
is rather severe Market interference uh
but when you study market economies you
don't count that you don't count the
fact that there was a massive Market
interference namely by state violence uh
of the most extreme kind that kept the
basic commodity cheap Tech cotton was
like oil today and in fact oil is kept
cheap the same way uh a huge part part
of the Pentagon budget is directed to
maintaining the price of oil within a
certain range the few studies that are
around count that as about 30% of 30%
subsidy of the oil price and there's
plenty of other energy subsidies well
those things just aren't counted but
even if you take the things that are
counted the facts are very very clear uh
under the current version of traditional
mechanisms about half the population of
the world right now is literally in rece
receivership that means their economic
policies are managed by bureaucrats in
Washington but even in the rich
countries democracy's under attack by
virtue of the shift of decision making
from governments which may be partially
responsible to the population to private
tyrannies which don't have those defects
they're unaccountable so they're fine
shift decisions to them everything's
great uh and that has very Striking
Effects so take say Latin American
uh Latin America has undergone a wave of
democratization in the past 10 or 15
years military dictatorships were
replaced by democracies uh but uh you
know academic Specialists who follow
this closely have been observing for
years that as democracy is extended in
Latin America uh disillusionment with
democracy is increasing and that Trend
continues just recently released study
revealed that about half the population
of Latin America would now support
support democracy and about half would
be willing to accept military
dictatorships the military dictatorships
in Latin America were extremely brutal
Affairs but after the wave of
democratization about half the
population wouldn't mind if they came
back and the reasons are very clear uh
they're reported in fact even in the
business press London Financial Times
reporting this said that the reason is
an alarming Trend which links de lining
economic fortunes with a lack of faith
in the institutions of democracy and the
reason is that the this U much praised
new wave of democracy happened to
coincide with neoliberal economic
programs which undermine democracy so
you get more formal democracy and more
disillusionment with democracy and
indeed Latin America which has followed
the rules most religiously has been one
of the regions that had the worst worst
economic record uh it's correlation that
holds
worldwide uh that also holds for the
United States I'm sure you read a lot
about the big clamor about the stolen
election of November 19 November 2000
you know Florida votes and Supreme Court
and so on if you read closely you'll
notice that there though there was a
huge issue in the press and among Elite
commentators they were very surprised at
the fact that the public didn't care the
public expressed no concern over the
fact that the election was stolen they
could never get a rise out of the public
with all the publicity and the reasons
are very clear from extensive public
opinion studies they revealed that on
the eve of the election so no Florida
shenanigans on the eve of the election
about 75% of the population regarded the
whole process as a farce uh it was a
game played by Rich corporations who do
the funding Party leaders who were all
Crooks and the public relations industry
which is just crafting candidates to say
things that you can't believe even if
you can understand them uh so who cares
what happens it's stolen what's a
difference that make any difference
anyway uh that's in fact these same
studies reveal uh this there's a measure
of what they call uh helplessness you
know inability to affect anything that
happens that's been going up very fast
it hit uh its highest level uh last
November with about half the population
saying that people like us have little
or no influence on what government does
that's a very sharp rise right through
the neoliberal period uh where there are
issues that separate the public from the
business World they simply don't appear
in the agenda so International economic
issues public has very strong feelings
business has very strong feelings but
they're opposite feelings accordingly
the issue cannot arise in the campaign
uh the free trade area the Americas for
example could not be mentioned in the
campaign uh and that's true in general
of these things called free trade
agreements actually the business press
more accurately calls them a free uh
free investment agreements that's what
we ought to call them the free
investment Agreements are opposed by the
public supported by the business world
and Elites generally therefore they
cannot appear as issues in
campaigns uh
not know the original the Constitutional
system in the United States was actually
designed to have this effect very
consciously James Madison who the main
framer uh in the constitutional
convention uh he explained that uh the
goal of government is to protect the
minority of the opulent against the
majority uh and he said therefore to
achieve this political power must be
placed in the hands of the wealth of the
nation Men Who can be trusted to secure
the permanent interests of the country
which are the rights of the property
owners and to defend these interests
against what he call the leveling Spirit
of the general population yeah that
continues to the present you know it
takes various forms but that same
principle is a leading principle of
progressive political thought
Progressive note uh right up to the
present and uh you know technical
political scientist types who write
about these things say that it's wrong
to describe the United States as a
democracy it should be described as a
polyarchy that is a system in which
Elites Rule and the public
ratifies uh the public is supposed to
show up every couple of years and say
you know you make the decisions and then
you go home and you know buy shoes or
something like that that's the ideal
system and from that point of view the U
November 2000 election didn't reveal
flaw La of American democracy but
revealed its Triumph uh and that Triumph
has been greatly enhanced by the
neoliberal programs well throughout all
of this a crucial element is restriction
of information that's why there's a huge
public relations industry they tell you
what they're doing you know it's like
it's not a secret the founding documents
of the pr industry back in the
1920s
this guy I'm quoting as one of the
founders of it a Roosevelt Kennedy
liberal uh and he had a classic manual
in which he said the goal of the
industry is to regiment the public mind
every bit as much as an army regiments
the bodies of its soldiers and that's
necessary you can't have democracy
otherwise unless the population is
totally regimented you can't have allow
democracy because the population will do
what they want and that won't be
securing the permanent interests of the
country namely the rights of the rich
who have to be protected from the
majority uh this is quite conscious
there's nothing secret about it it's the
standard political science literature
supported by Major figures Joseph
Schumer Walter Lipman and others well
the struggle to impose that regime takes
many forms it never ends it's going to
continue as long as there are high
concentrations of Power with the
decision making controlling decision
making and it's only reasonable to
expect the Masters to exploit any
opportunity that they have at the moment
the fear and anguish in the face of the
terrorist attacks but there's absolutely
no reason to accept those rules and
fortunately plenty of people are not
accepting them there's been a very
impressive increase in opposition taking
totally new forms in recent years it
mostly developed in the South it's been
joined by the north uh recently uh the
Masters of the Universe are very scared
uh they they they recognize what's
happening the meeting in Qatar I'm sure
you know is an expression of the fear
that the public may become involved if
they could figure out how to meet in a
space shuttle they meet there just keep
the public away because it's too
dangerous uh every time the public
breaks through there is panic in the
business pris literal Panic uh they know
their sit their control is extremely
fragile uh it can be destroyed at any
time uh it's mainly a matter of uh uh
not accepting the uh injunction to be
passive and acquiescent and to realize
that power actually is in the hands of
populations particularly in the you know
more free and Democratic societies where
it's impossible to use really massive
Force to uh uh and violence to suppress
the general population uh these popular
movements are unprecedented in scale
there's been nothing like them in
history in the range of constituency and
in international solidarity and I think
uh the future to a very large extent
lies in their hands and it's very hard
to overestimate what's at
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
stake
[Music]
[Applause]
uh thank you very much for this
wonderfully rich and thought-provoking
lecture uh I did tell you that no
chumsky knows a fair amount of economics
and I hope that you're convinced now and
he has put us me and my colleagues in
the difficult position now of having to
either accept what he said and forget a
lot of what we've been teaching for for
years or having to argue with him which
may be even
harder uh don't go away as Larry King
says there's still a lot of uh exciting
uh things on the program for the next
hour and a half um we will have a long
question answer with Norm Chomsky a
little later on if you wish to an uh to
ask a question we'd like to ask you to
please give it in writing to facilitate
the proceeding so if you have any
question please put it in writing and
bring it here to the
front um the last half hour of the
question answer session uh will be for
the Press so we will ask the press to
ask questions at that time and that will
be directly not in writing but the
anyone else uh would like to ask a
question then please do it in writing uh
before that we are going to have now a
short summary translation by Barra 10 15
minutes for those who could not follow
the lecture uh in English then we'll
have another short song from ramjas
college students and then other speeches
from uh aruno Sid vajan and others and
then the question answer session um we
apologize for those who could not hear
very well from the back we are unable to
increase the volume because there are
exams going on around here but we're
going to try to relocate the speakers to
improve the sound
system um and now I'd like to invite bad
to uh give us a short translation in
Hindi after that oh already a question
has come thank you
