they told me the lights would go and
that was my queue but some of them have
remained of those guys back there yeah
yeah so uh n chsky thanks for coming
along here to chadam
house uh we've got just about an hour
okay and uh know tomsky has some stuff
that he has to do later on uh we're
incredibly grateful to you for finding
this little
space and the con is that we have a
conversation now I think we should
perhaps talk about American foreign
policy and not just gossip
though it does allow that that's what
they announced might as well talk about
it uh but I'm hoping we can move fairly
briskly into uh a question and answer
session so we maximize our time this
requires a degree of restraint on the
part of us all not at least myself you
will not even be told my name much less
my record in a boring cherish kind of
way uh it requires restraint on your
part and you will forgive me in advance
if I stop you fine in order to
move a family man my my children had a
line that they used if they asked a
question as kids do they'd sometimes say
just the five minute lecture
please and over time it was four then
three then two and it'll require
discipline on your parts as well please
and I might be quite tough on that h no
speeches I'll repeat that you know later
on say who you are if you feel you can
the more concise the questions the more
enjoyably is for us all and I have here
we do say tweet questions and since we
say this we should nod in the direction
of Twitter I have a Twitter Guru where
is my Twitter Guru where is my expert
she's lurking close to the exit Ste will
be uh Stephanie will be asked perhaps to
produce a Twitter tweet and also you
guys can tweet so as we are proceeding
if there's something that strikes you
want to say all all you have to do is
tweet if you do tweet uh and all you
have to do is Hash
askc uh but people who are outside the
hall people who are not here can do it
as well so it's a nice way of broadening
the
audience uh no
the I guess crudely the Snowden
stuff uh a surprise and I mean by that a
surprise at quite how extraordinary it
was or not a surprise at all I think the
scale was at least to me very
surprising uh it is in fact phenomenal
actually there's a new book by Glenn
Greenwald I don't know if it's come out
here which surveys a lot of it brings it
together and it's really a colossal
campaign I it's very clear that they
want to pick up
everything uh everything that anyone
says who they meet uh who they see
anything you can think of it's uh 100%
the goal is 100% collection of all
information about all of the enemies of
the state and what this reveals pretty
dramatically is something we all ought
to know that uh for States one of their
main enemies is the domestic population
they have to be kept under control
they're dangerous and if you look at uh
policy decisions it's pretty consistent
that uh you have to control uh this
dangerous enemy this is an this carries
it Way Beyond anything that's been done
before of course there's been plenty
before I mean I was during the 1960s I
was very much involved in resistance
activities against the war in Vietnam
and we understood that you can't talk on
the telephone and if there's anything
serious something that would involve
particular human beings let's say a
deserter or something you couldn't even
talk in a group of friends because
there's probably a government Informer
there so everything had to be done with
affinity groups so and this is well
understood and goes way back but nothing
like this scale has ever happened and
Britain agrees as you probably saw the
British government requested the NSA to
uh uh provide a detailed extensive
information on cell phones social media
other forms of interaction for British
citizens who are an enemy of this state
uh in the United States it's it's kind
of dramatic because of the Fourth
Amendment to the Constitution the Fourth
Amendment to the Constitution part of
the Bill of Rights uh guarantees the
security of uh citiz
in their persons homes papers and
effects and bars what are called
unreasonable section seizures there's a
reason for that has to do with England
the British
rulers uh demanded
before demanded the right to break into
homes to search them and there were
pretty bitter confrontations right in
Boston where I live in fact uh the
citizens
organizing to Bar the entry of British
officers under what we called rits of
assistance that they could just enter
wherever they like uh this was one of
the things that sparked the American
Revolution and shortly afterwards when
the Bill of Rights was introduced into
the Constitution uh they made sure to
put a barrier against any such practices
on the part of the state well now the
this the fourth amendment is is being
violated in a way which is so dramatic
that it takes your colleagues in the
legal profession to try to figure out
how to make them consistent but then
they can always find Professor who can
do the other work that's the role of
lawyers when well I wouldn't I wouldn't
I wouldn't go that far but they'll find
a way to say that knowing everything
that you do is a reasonable SE search
and seizure when you compare though when
you compare the response to Watergate
which when you look at what's happening
today seems small beer and yet it
brought down a president now maybe it do
cover up maybe it wasn't but has the has
the culture in America change marketly
in what is now 50 years since that
time well I have to tell you that I was
a minority of maybe one in thinking that
Watergate was a kind of a tea party
actually was asked to write about
Watergate uh right away by the New York
Review and I agreed but I said I would
write only if I could explain that it
didn't amount to anything in fact it was
pretty striking the Watergate exposures
came out at the very same time as the
exposures of Co inel Pro same time Co
inel Pro was a massive uh
government uh criminal operation
directed against the population that
went through four
administrations uh mainly Kennedy and
Johnson and and started a little earlier
and it targeted virtually all critical
uh thought and action for not only
surveillance but for
disruption went Way Beyond the Snowden
case it uh it went as far as literal
political assassination in fact right at
the time of Watergate there was an
exposure of the fact that in uh
1969 in one of the co to Pro operations
this is an FBI operation FBI is the
national political police so they
targeted they were trying to destroy the
black the black movements and they
really decimated them mostly
the the peak the worst case which had
just appeared the time of Watergate was
the assassination of Fred Hampton Fred
Hampton was a a black panther an
organizer very successful organizer no
Char criminal charges nothing like that
uh he was organizing in the Chicago
ghettos uh the FBI under coel Pro wanted
to assassinate him they tried at first
to incite uh a criminal gang in the
ghetto the Rangers Blackstone Rangers to
kill him they sent false uh letters to
the heads of the Rangers written in kind
of fake black dialect with which they
decoded instantly FBI is not very smart
to U try to tell them that you know that
Fred Hampton was going to go after them
so they' react but they didn't can can I
come in on this and then the yeah go on
I want to ask you a general question
about this if you well let me one more
what happened is that at the FBI had um
implanted an Informer who was Hampton's
bodyguard and they gave false
information to the Chicago Police
about guns in the apartment uh 4:00 a.m.
the police broke in a really gapo style
raid and just murdered him his bed that
that alone just swamps all of the
Watergate exposures and interestingly it
was barely reported and that's only one
I mean they went a lot of other things
under coino Pro which was far more
serious than Watergate and I think more
serious than the NS is this in its
modern form the use of drones to kill
people abroad so I wonder the drones is
that a modern equivalent Dron and and I
want to ask a sub question about that
which is the nature of American public
opinion you paint just now and you do in
your writings a picture of a kind of a
really easily L amorphous Community
which can be misled by this and led by
that and so on I mean well take a CO Pro
I it's hard to say that people were
misled they didn't know about it yeah uh
there is uh something called journalism
which is supposed to have the task of uh
presenting to the public things that are
significant and uh uh important for them
to play a role in a Democratic Society
but that role
is sometimes fulfilled wouldn't say zero
but to a very limited extent in the case
of coel pro there was virtually no
coverage
the Hampton assassination people
couldn't protest because they didn't
know about it take drones take drones uh
the Drone campaign is a global terrorism
campaign run by the Obama Administration
which has absolutely no counterpart uh
there's a new there used to be some
notion lawyers will remember is this old
thing called the magnet Carta which will
be commemorating in its death in next
year 800 years 800 years don't don't
answer Robert Worster here he'll be very
but it it
established in a narrow form but it
established the notion of presumption of
innocence uh pretty narrow but then it
was extended over the years that's been
torn to shreds by now guilty means uh
that Obama decided on Tuesday morning to
kill you that's the definition of guilty
Tuesday morning there are these sessions
in the white house where they read a
little St Augustine unjust Wars and then
decide who we're going to murder today
and they're called they're recognized to
be
suspects there's and it's massive you
know it's
a all over large parts of the world and
they can be American as they have been
well it's interesting there are a few
cases I think four where American
citizens were killed now that has caused
a lot of debate and discussion
which is curious the tacit assumption is
that if you want to kill
non-americans uh it's free do it do
whatever you like but murdering American
citizens well you know raises some
constitutional questions so that's
debated but uh be but I mean suppose say
that uh Iran let's say was had this had
the capacity to uh murder people in the
United States and Israel who
who they regard as a threat I mean they
have good reason to regard them as a
threat like uh leading figures in top
leaders in the United States and Israel
are regularly saying uh that all options
are open which means if we want to carry
out a nuclear attack against you we'll
do it uh John McCain during the last
campaign his when he ran his line was
just bomb bomb bomb don't wait let's
bomb them so there are plenty of people
who they could regard as a threat
suppose they decided to assassinate them
would we sit here quietly and say well
it's fine they're not Iranian citizens
so why shouldn't they assassinate them
but when we do it it's considered
legitimate and it's pretty striking that
the US government
recognizes two things that are important
one is they're not only killing suspects
they're generating terrorists then know
very well that these campaigns are
generating terrorists when you start
murdering people in tribal
societies uh which have a culture of
defense and revenge they respond uh take
say
9/11 turns out that 11 of the 19
apprehended hijackers were from a tribe
in Yemen that had been bitterly
repressed and
attacked first by the center and then by
the you know International supporters of
it and they were taking Revenge there's
a very important book on this by uh
Akbar Ahmed is a Pakistani
Anthropologist teaches in the United
States is one of the leading experts on
tribal societies and he just calls it a
war against the tribal um tribal Islam
and tribal societies generally which
react the other thing uh is that uh
that it's it's it's that it is really
massive terrorism large scale terrorism
and the fact that we accept it is pretty
remarkable and the acceptance is limited
the former head of the CIA Michael
Hayden pointed out recently that uh
there isn't a single government in the
world which accepts Washington's legal
basis for the Drone campaign he said
with two exceptions uh Israel and
Afghanistan and I suspect he's wrong
about
Afghanistan that's the support uh so you
generate terrorists you kill whoever you
like uh and there's no support for it
but it continues what about what about
the the argument that yeah we're going
to alienate a few guys but we we take
out the leaders you know we take out to
use that sort of military uh image and
secondly you may call it terrorism but
it's our terrorism you know the famous
Clash of civilization stuff that was
copyrighted in the American think tanks
and books about lesser evils and so on
how I mean in a way we we have democracy
we have the rule of law we're the good
guys at this you have absolutely
contempt for that but I wonder whether
there isn't at its core some basic truth
that the fact that these societies are
different sure we're we're much more
violent and aggressive and in fact when
this happens in a democ more or less
Democratic Society uh citizens are much
more culpable than when it's done in an
authoritarian State like say suppose
Iran was murdering people who were
threatening it in the United States and
Israel and probably Britain well Iranian
citizens couldn't do very much about
that it's a harsh authoritarian State
it's different here we're we're pretty
free and if we accept it and tolerate it
that is morally very culpable
uh you may recall I hope you've read uh
Orwell's uh introduction to Animal Farm
as you probably know it was not
published found 30 years later in his
unpublished papers but it's interesting
uh in it he addresses himself to the
people of England free England and he
says you shouldn't feel too
self-righteous about this satirical
denunciation of the totalitarian enemy
because in England actually I'm quoting
now he said in England unpopular ideas
can be suppressed without the use of
force and one of the mechanisms that he
mentions is a good education if you've
gone to the best schools
uh LSA and so on thank you for that plug
a rather ambivalent PL then you have
instilled into you the understanding
that there are certain things it
wouldn't do to say and I think we can
add it wouldn't do to think that's a
significant element in free societies
and carries with it severe moral
responsibility much more so than uh
people who suffer in authoritarian or
totalitarian States I think that's
something we PID much too little
attention to does it mean you end up
watching we'll say something like this
the the Russian taking of the Crimea uh
what's going on in Syria uh possibly
people might take China and Tibet you
end up a kind of spectator because
you've taken away the power to intervene
is that a logical position that you go
to well take Crimea it's an interesting
case uh the Russian takeover of Crimea
is undoubtedly a criminal act it
violates the UN Charter it violates
specific treaties in which Russia agreed
with others to observe the U boundaries
of Ukraine so it's a criminal act is it
is it the only such act in the world for
example how much have you read about a
much more severe case the US take over
of Southeastern Cuba 110 years ago us
took over Southeastern Cuba at the point
of a
gun technically there was a treaty but
under military occupation you know what
that means there was a treaty in which
it's what we call Guantanamo that
includes Cuba's major port the US has
absolutely no claim to it
whatever one thinks about Crimea there
is a claim of popular support
history's handing over of Crimea to
Ukraine without even asking the
population a referendum in 1991 which
came out with about the same results as
the recent one uh the major Russian warm
water Port Naval Base I mean there's
considerations uh in the case of the US
takeover Southeastern Cuba there is
nothing uh since Cuban Independence in
1959 the Cuban governments been trying
to get it back us of course refuses the
only
justification is that this severely
hampers the economic development of Cuba
for 50 years the United States has been
engaged in a significant war against
Cuba under Kennedy it was a large scale
terrorist campaign
we don't talk about it here but it was a
very serious terrorist Campaign which
continued uh crushing embargo taking
over the Southeastern Cuba of course
severely hampers Cuban development
that's the point this is much worse than
uh the Russians though their actions are
criminal have a much stronger case how
much have you read in the Press about
this and it's not the only case I I I
totally take that one but I met the guy
who who the China guy who is equiv of
our press guy Alistar Campbell it used
to be and they used to publish this
report about how Dreadful America was
all the people who died who were killed
the rapes the race killings and whenever
you raised human rights with them they'd
say with respect kind of what you've
said you know America look at all the
violence look at Rodney King is it sort
of always an appropriate response
because it seems to me all that happens
is you just say oh what Russia does is
bad what China does is bad but my
goodness look what America does I mean
it seems to be a kind of Dodge of the
criticism is it I don't see why it's a
Dodge we accept that we accept that
principle uniformly with regard to enemy
States so for example if Sharin abadi
criticizes Iran but doesn't criticize
Israel or if iway way criticizes China
but doesn't denounce the United States
or saharov havl anyone we admire them
for that
that's what they should be doing they
should be concentrating on the crimes of
their own countries and for us that's
even more significant for the reason I
mentioned we can influence these
policies iway way can't do much about
the policies of China we admire him for
condemning them uh we we don't want him
nobody wants him to uh write about um
you know the US and British crimes it's
a waste of his time uh he should but he
should be doing exactly what he's doing
and we have a far greater responsibility
to do it because we are responsible for
these policies in a way which dissidents
and harsh states are not and we can
influence them but it's pretty striking
that we recognize this principle
reflexively with regard to enemy States
and we can't see it with regard to
ourselves where it's much more
significant yeah if you take say that
example of critiquing from the inside M
and Walt made a huge uh Splash with a
book about the power of the Israeli
Lobby in the United States in a way it
resembles what Piet is doing at the
moment with the uh the book on Capital
what do these books gain Traction in
American society they are published in
America America they're talked about in
America or do they disappear what
happens to descent strong descent within
the American political tradition well
the the picky book has been well
received lots of comment on it mostly by
economists in the business press and
it's undoubtedly the important book The
reason why it shouldn't be Mir shamer
Walt's a little bit different uh for one
thing there the there's two question
there's number of questions to ask about
the you know the book I'm sure you the
uh one thing has to do with the quality
of their claims the other is about its
reception and notice that the re the I
think it is well received and I think
the reason is it exculpates the US
government it says look we're fine what
but what can we do there's this powerful
Jewish Lobby that's controlling us so
we'd be delighted to be benevolent and
uh you know helping people our Natural
Instincts but we're trapped yeah by the
Jewish Lobby well that's a pretty good
reason I think why it's it is accepted
the second question is about the thesis
I mean can it really be that uh a small
ethnic Lobby controls US
policy I mean if this if anybody
believes that thesis there's a there's a
tactical suggestion that that follows
immediately put on your tie and jacket
go to the Executive offices of LED
Martin General Electric U Goldman Sachs
JP Morgan Chase and explain to them that
your interests are being harmed by a
little Lobby which you can put out of
business in five minutes okay that's the
Tactical suggestion that follows does
anybody pursue it no because it's absurd
I mean the claim this it's this is
actually is an interesting shimer and
wal are very good Scholars they're what
are called realist IR Scholars
according to realist scholar
scholarship uh States pursue what is
called the national interest with
primarily security that's it's an
anarchic world and States try to
preserve their own security well-being
of their own populations and the
national interest there's a lot of
questions that are open there first of
all what is the national interest I mean
is the national interest of the CEO of
General electric the same as the
interest of the janitor who cleans his
floors no their interests are quite
different so what what's the national
interest well you know in practice it
turns out that the interests of state
power and concentrated economic power
take a look at the formation of policy
that's what it defends is the national
interest in that sense harmed by US
policy towards
Israel well pretty hard hard to argue
that uh certainly centers of American
power don't think so like say take say
locki Martin which or the military lob
industry allog together big Lobby they
think it's great I mean when the United
States uh uh gives Israel couple of
billion dollars to buy advanced oraments
that's a gift to L Martin in fact it's a
double gift because it's what in the
retail trade is called a teas
uh it means that Saudi Arabia comes
along and says wait a minute we want $60
billion worth of second rate equipment
which we don't know how to opgrade and
so defense industry can sell it to them
you know so that's wonderful furthermore
Israel tests the high-tech equipment on
live targets you learn things from that
there are very close relations of
intelligence very close if you took a
look at uh it goes way back actually
this one of the interesting Snowden
Revelations is that Israel is the only
country that gets raw data not what's
called minimized most data in the NSA is
supposed to be kind of checked so you
know things that are really improper and
illegal are thrown out and that's the
way it's given to the so-called five
eyes you know England Australia the
close allies not Israel they get
straight
data and the intelligence relations are
extremely close uh military relations
are so close you you may have seen uh
one of the interesting Wikileaks
exposures was a list of
uh super strategic sites sites that are
so important that the United States has
to defend them at all
costs were not many of them one of them
was right outside hia the Raphael
military IND Industries that's one of
the super significant us sites that has
to be defended it's a military industry
high-tech U military it's one of the
places where they did a lot of the drum
technology their relations with the
Pentagon are so close that they actually
move their management offices to
Washington where the uh you know where
the money is uh you take a look at say
us investors Warren
Buffett Intel
they're investing in Israel all over the
place Buffett uh recently spent I don't
know a billion dollars or something to
acquire some Israeli company and
announced that Israel is the best place
for us investors outside the United
States Intel set up their biggest new
Factory for New Generation chips in
Israel I mean do these people think that
their their interest is being harmed by
this relationship can can I can I come
in there because we're goingon to have
to go to the audience grudgingly on my
part in a minute John kery Rings you up
tomorrow he says this this two State
thing it's failed no I'm fed up with you
telling me what to do I'll do whatever
you tell me and he's only got a minute
you know the AIDS are
circling what what you know what what's
next one
state well I'm sorry to be a minority of
one again but I think that the entire
discourse on This is highly misleading
the usual uh discussion almost Universal
on the part of Israeli authorities
Palestinians International commentators
almost everything is that there are two
options either two states or if that's
gone one state and in fact a lot of
Palestinians support that they say okay
let's have Israel let's give them the
keys they take the whole place over
we'll run a civil rights struggle confin
anti-apartheid struggle that's all Pie
in the Sky those are not the two options
there are two options one is the
international consensus on two states
the second option is Israel continues
doing exactly what it is doing now with
us support Israel doesn't want to take
over the the Palestinian population in
fact what they're doing it's right
before your eyes they're carrying out
settlement and development programs
which carve up the West Bank Gaza is
kept as a prison carve up the West Bank
in a way
which integrates into Israel the parts
of the West Bank that they want the
pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv the Jordan Valley where they're
kicking out
Palestinians the corridors that go
through to the east Mala Dum in the
South Ariel in the north break up the
region into sort of
cantons uh and it uh take over the major
resources including water but leave out
the
population it's designed so that they
will
not uh there will be very few
Palestinians in the regions that are
integrated into Israel ultimately be an
next to it so in fact there won't be
What's called the famous demographic
problem too many too many Arabs in a
Jewish State it's not going to happen
what'll happen in fact is that the
proportion of Jews in Greater Israel
will go up when they bring in the
settlers because they're there first of
all there aren't a lot of Palestinians
in those areas and the ones who are
there are being kicked out that's the
second option so if you don't have a
two-state solution this is what's going
to happen as long as the US and Britain
support it of course yeah that's crucial
fantastic I mean already a lot of people
have caught my eye and I I do deploy a
geographic gendered youth agist approach
to cues you have to stand up this
gentleman caught my ey about two hours
ago he's been in a camp bed since
yesterday but I'm looking at the back
for the lady is that a lady I'm applying
a gender test very good so this
gentleman this gentleman in blue I'm
afraid and then the lady in the middle
you have to wait for the microphone you
have to stand up you have to give us
your name and you have to be incredibly
succinct uh James ther I was at the
Cooper Union with you two weeks ago and
couldn't ask the question uh I'm a
novelist I work since the Ted offensive
in this country with seven human rights
groups on almost all the issues you
mentioned uh I deplore and was alarmed
to see uh Gary Will's comment just after
Obama was elected that given the War
Powers Act in 41 um the military we have
in 120 countries the 1.2 million top
security cleared Spooks in the
Washington area if Obama had 36 years he
couldn't dismember this do you feel as
an American that our Constitution and
our government is beyond recall do you
think there's any way that we can
actually get back to what the in fathers
intended I'm going to take a couple you
if I want that's thank you James that's
a model actually slight comment question
sir you going to emulate that skill at
concision and there's a lady who's going
to have a microphone who's whichever
lady yes that lady whose hand is up in
the foreground yes sir right my name is
Mike hary very simple question can you
envisage anything changing Americans
America's supportive policy towards
Israel thank you very much there's one
more to come on this wave Madam have you
got the way where you go be master of
public administration at London School
of economics in 2010 in your interview
to democracy now you supported a
statement expressed by then in financial
times that the major Pro for problem of
foreign policy of Obama's administration
back then was Iran do you think it
shifted nowadays to Russia due to the
failure to reign in its uh imperialistic
Ambitions or it's too uh too simple to
narrow down it just to one country thank
okay did you get those three this is I
can I sub it down and you tell me if I'm
wrong basically Iran was the big deal in
2010 you said a major policy challenge
for America the United States and now
it's shifted to Russia would that be
about a fair summary of it so that's
that one and you heard the other two I
think but we well let's take the last
actually 2010 was an interesting year in
US Iranian relations uh as you may
recall that was the year I think in
which uh a deal was reached between
Brazil turkey and Iran which would have
pretty much settled whatever the issue
was supposed to be the basic principles
of the deal were that uh Iran would ship
its low enriched uranium out of the
country uh to presumably to be kept in
turkey and in return the West would
provide uh medical Isotopes for the
Iranian research
reactors uh as soon as that deal was
reached it was bitterly condemned by the
White House and reflexively by the Press
I don't know what happened here you tell
me uh the Brazilian government was
pretty irritated by that the foreign
minister amarim released a letter from
President Obama to president Lula in
which Obama had proposed this presumably
because he assumed that Iran would turn
it down and they'd get a propaganda
point
when Iran accepted it they denounced it
uh it was pretty much ignored in the
United States this um there's all kind
of pretexts for why they had to turn it
down but what happened is interesting uh
this remain Iran uh remains uh we may
ask why Iran is regarded as the way they
put it the greatest threat to World
Peace you know the the president uh the
Congress the Press
regularly describes Iran this way
incidentally it's not the way the world
perceives it there was an interesting
International poll that came out in
December run by Leading us British
polling agencies it was actually was
reported in BBC I don't think it was
reported in the United States uh the
poll among other questions asked which
country is the greatest threat to World
Peace the United States was so far in
the lead nobody was even close second
way behind was Pakistan and that was
probably mostly because of the Indian
vote but Iran was way down but in the
United States uh and much of Britain too
much of the West Iran is the greatest
threat to World Peace we may ask
why why is Iran the greatest threat to
World Peace well there's an
authoritative answer to that it's the US
intelligence agencies and the Pentagon
give a annual report to Congress on the
Global Security situation it's public
it's not classified it doesn't get
reported but you can find it on the
internet and they
explain of course they have a section on
Iran and they explain why it's a threat
what they point out is that Iran is not
a military threat it has very low
military expenditures even by the
standards of the region alone the the US
uh it uh its strategic doctrines are
defensive designed to deter an attack
long ago long enough for diplomacy to
set in that's a strategic doctrines uh
then they they say well if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons and of course
us intelligence doesn't know they say
that would be part of their deterrence
strategy that's that's quite significant
aggressive States like the US Britain
Israel cannot tolerate a deterrent
strategy it's too dangerous you have to
be free to use military force whenever
you want and it's true that Iran would
be a deterrent if it
had they also accuse Iran of
terrorism terrorism means support for
forces that the US doesn't like
so Iran supports Hamas supports
jbala we could discuss exactly what they
are but let's get on the other two
because I want to I want to go around
woman has caught my eye here younger guy
has caught my eye a problem going back
to your yeah quickly change on Israel
you brought the situ up the fact that
the US has about a thousand military
bases around the world rapidly expanding
this incidentally particularly in Africa
africam you know the
uh the Africa force is greatly expanding
putting bases all over the place no
other country has anything remotely like
this this is unique to the United States
and it's part of a whole system of
global control can it be changed very
easily uh go back to orw I mean if
people in the United States and
secondarily England which is significant
in this respect if they sit passively
and quietly and dos and intimidated and
accept what's going on then it can't be
changed but we have enormous options of
course we can change it I mean the
British Parliament for example voted to
uh block a strike against Syria well
that pretty much compelled the United
States to go along it's just one
indication of what can be done across
the board so sure we can change it but
not if we sit quietly and passively and
say let's blame the enemy but not look
at ourselves you know then nothing will
change uh the uh uh this is well
understood by Leading American Scholars
so for example the uh professor of U the
science of government at Harvard I love
that title the science of government at
Harvard Samuel Huntington who was a
leading figure civilizations guy right
but he pointed out in interestingly in
1981 a significant year
he pointed out that uh he said uh States
the state Authority the United States
government has to impose a system of
force which is felt but not
seen uh Power remains strong when it's
in the dark uh when
it when it's hit by sunlight that
evaporates and then he expanded on that
this is 1981 he said when the United
States engages in military or other in
uh intervention in the world we must
create the
misimpression that it's the Russians we
fighting that way we intimidate the
population in the passivity and of
course it was a misimpression could go
on with 1981 but his point is accurate
if people will remain intimidated and
passive no then there's no way to change
it and this applies to Israel too uh US
policies towards Israel are not Braven
in stone and in fact interesting
developments are taking place in the
United States I've been writing and
speaking about this for 50 years I
literally used to have police protection
when I gave a talk on it even at my own
University literally MIT if I gave a
talk on this topic uh the Cambridge and
MIT police would be there they insist on
taking me back to my car and so on on
all over the country and now it is
radically changed it's one of the
leading topics on campus uh thousands of
people show up for talks you can't get a
hostile question literally uh that's
part of a change that's taking place
among the population will it affect
policy that's up to us it can change
it's by now just there's no time to talk
about that I'm glad to do it if you want
but I think you can easily show that for
the last 35 years the barrier to a
diplomatic settlement has been in
Washington and its allies and that
continues today and that can change okay
we I'll pull in there um you may want to
come back to it I'm I'm moving on the
aisles there's a lady uh you caught my
eye earlier down there woman excuse me
there over there somewhere there's a
younger man whose hand was up there it's
it's was it you yeah it's a chat with a
hand up now and Stephanie are we getting
ready for a tweet interlude where are we
where are you gone and we'll take one
from you these three and we'll try and
wrap it through them okay do you want a
glass of water no fine uh you've got the
microphone name stand up and and concise
okay concise hi my name is Denise rud
I'm a member of chatton house um the US
is known as having a very strong
unilateral sanctions regime um can you
maybe speak and give us your thoughts on
the use of sanctions to advance foreign
policy objectives and impose extr
territoriality effectively um and do you
think that the US will be able to
continue using these unilateral
sanctions uh in the long run to have an
impact globally okay you mean kind of
smart sanctions for these against
individuals or and economic sanctions
financial and economic sanctions against
we're trying to Russia Russia the latest
whatever it is Cuba yeah the UN stuff
like that Brant thank you
sir uh thank you John algar member of
Cham house um Professor Chomsky um I
just wondering your 1967 essay in the
New York Review of Books on the
responsib test of um of
intellectuals um has anything
significantly changed since you wrote
that essay how has the role of the
intellectual in public discourse changed
and to what degree has it become more
influential or less in your opinion
thank you okay the role of the
intellectual hasn't changed since n 67
you recall that article and you need to
update it briefly but you've
got you've got a minute because
Stephanie's going to come in Stephanie
how are we looking it's like the
Eurovision s on the Tweet barometer okay
so I've got a a Twitter based question
um Tomy says domestic population is
enemy of State in other forums he said
social media atomizes Society should I
delete
Twitter um I have another one um should
Bush and Blair face trial for their con
conduct of the Iraq War
okay thank you and these are from I
couldn't get those repeat them uh yeah I
I I would have difficulty repeating the
first it's sort of should we abolish
social media Stephanie is that more or
less it basically B I've sub these down
with great vulgarity and the other is
should we impeach Blair and Bush should
there be legal processes to
establish uh retribution legal
retribution for actions well I don't
regard that as retribution but just uh
punishment for crimes yeah I mean the
worst crime of the 21st century has been
the bush Blair invasion of Iraq uh
totally without any credible pretext uh
if you notice the pretext kept changing
every time the facts changed uh the uh
it's a textbook example of aggression
Supreme International crime under
international law differing from other
war crimes and that it in includes all
of the evil that follows that's the
Norberg judgment on uh and you'll recall
perhaps that Robert Jackson the US
prosecutor at nurenberg who warned the
tribunal that as he put it we're giving
these defendants a poison chalice and if
we sip from it we must be treated the
same way or else the nberg tribunal is a
farce Victor's justice so sure they
should be subjected to international law
now in the United States that can't
happen because the United States
uniquely is
self-immune against law uh when the
United States supported the U
International court of justice and
practically initiated in
1946 they added a Proviso that the US
cannot be charged with violation of
international treaties they meant
specifically the UN charge Charter which
bans the use of force or the OAS Charter
uh that's been accepted by the courts in
fact if you look at the record just
about the US rarely U ratifies any
International agreements but when it
does there's almost invariably a
reservation which says what's called
non-self-executing
technically that means doesn't apply to
US unless there's specific legislation
and that's accepted by the courts like
for example when Yugoslavia brought
charges against NATO uh the
US appealed to the court and said we
can't be charged and the reason was that
they had mentioned the word genocide and
when the US signed the genocide
convention ratified it 40 years later
there was a reservation saying
inapplicable to the United States uh so
this is across the board us is immune
self immunized to international law
Britain not quite that much but these
are really things that are in the hands
of the public again if we permit our
leaders to be major war criminals sure
that's what they'll do uh Power tries to
achieve whatever it can and if U its
domestic enemy allows it to do it
they'll do
it cases a case in point uh sanctions
maybe quickly sanctions well I think we
as in many of these cases we should try
to look at it from another point of view
imagine that Iran or Cuba had the power
to impose sanctions on the United States
should they do it they certainly have
plenty of justification for it I mean
I've mentioned a couple of cases should
they do it well you know I I wouldn't I
don't think that's the way uh they
should deal with these problems I don't
think it's the way we should and we are
more cable I mean we're the ones who are
carrying out attacks on them I mean take
say Iran the United St in
1953 the United States overthrew the
Parliamentary regime in Iran imposed the
harsh dictatorship from that day until
today there has literally not been a day
in which the US has not been punishing
Iran supported the Sha harsh
dictatorship
up till
79 uh immediately turned to supporting
Iraq's attack on Iran which was
murderous and brutal us supported it all
the way through uh with such enthusiasm
that uh it denied the attacks on the
Kurds pretended that Iran had done them
soon as the war was over the US uh this
the Bush Administration invited Iraqi
nuclear engin Engineers to the United
States for Advanced Training in nuclear
weapons production another threat
against Iran immediately sanctions were
imposed on Iran and then we come up to
the present this goes on literally not a
day in which Iran has not been subjected
to pretty harsh punishment by the United
States should they impose sanctions on
us assuming that it was conceivable well
you know you decide and I think that
gives the answer to that question John's
was about the intellectual 1967 I mean
well intellectuals is an interesting
concept I don't want to go on for too
long but the the word intellectual in
Western languages in the current sense
you know it really comes pretty much
from The dfus Trial before that I me
there were people we intellectuals but
it wasn't a category of disant at the
dfus trial you had desent intellectuals
amola the dfus ARs and so on
but take a close look they were a small
minority and they were persecuted aola
had to flee the country uh the
mainstream intellectuals you know the
Immortals of the academy Fran and so on
they strongly supported the state and
condemned the dards for daring to
criticize the Majesty of the Army and
the state and so on that's typical
there's very rarely an except ception to
that through history way back to periods
you can you know take say the Bible I
there were people in the Bible who are
pretty much what we call intellectuals
people who condemned the king for
criminal acts gave geopolitical analysis
uh charging them with threatening the
population calling for Mercy for widows
and orphans and so on we call them
prophets they had nothing that's just a
bad translation of an obscure Hebrew
word they were what we would call
dissident intellectuals how are they
treated that they were imprisoned they
were driven into the desert and
persecuted denounced that there were
intellectuals who were honored the
flatterers at the court hundreds of
years later they were called false
prophets not at the time that continues
right to the present the term dissident
in the United States in England refer
specifically to critical intellectuals
in enemy States right we don't call
critical intellectuals in our client
states dissidents even though they're
treated much more harshly than they were
in Eastern Europe so for example right
after the fall of the Berlin Wall uh the
uh Salvador the high command of the
Salvadorian governments us client close
close contact with the US Embassy
ordered a brigade the atad Brigade to
invade the university and murder six
leading Jesuit
intellectuals uh Latin one among leading
Latin American intellectuals how be
Jesuit priests they did they blew their
brains out do we call them dissidents
does anybody even know about it I mean
can you mention their names you know I
mean just imagine that this had happened
in Czechoslovakia or something I mean
probably nuclear war but it happened in
US domain so it just didn't happen and
this I can go on and on with this but if
you take a look
generally the people who we call
intellectuals people with funny category
but the people who are sufficiently
privileged and have sufficient resources
so that they can speak about articulate
articulately about issues of public
significance roughly when is
intellectuals
are overwhelmingly they're supportive of
power State and private power absolutely
overwhelming uh there's usually a in
every country some Fringe of critical uh
intellectuals if they're in enemy States
we honor them if they're in our own
client states we blow their brains out
and forget about it uh but that's pretty
much the way it's been through history
okay there's a few exceptions
few and very interesting ones which we
can think about later but I'm determined
to get another round in can we stay
another 5 minutes do H we have I've got
four sorry I have got four I've got this
gentleman here I've got this lady here
I've got the gentleman yes whose hand
put it up high so I know it's you not
you sadly you yes you you put your hand
up yeah you yeah and then this lady here
but these have to be ridiculously
succinct almost to the point of merely
your name
sir Ron and tinan it's just on the
question of human rights uh I agree with
you the United Kingdom played a major
role in stopping the kind of
intervention in Syria which would have
been wrong but unfortunately some people
seem to think the problem was solved an
egregious human rights violations sad
Barrel bombing campaign I mean it's
grotesque what's happening and the root
of the problem I put it here and it's
where the elite universities in
particular have been in disgrace is the
issue of human rights as you outlined as
usual in very eloquent terms the
egregious nature certainly against the
spirit of US Constitution what I'm
really saying is the United States has
given dictators of opportunity to
continue campaigns of brutality against
their own people and surely for people
who are interested in Progressive CA
that's called a leading question yeah
thank you very much I think point we
don't spend enough time thinking about
human rights I think it's a statement we
can come back to it about human rights
and the success of the change the United
States by no
microphone this is a disaster for the
chairman no I apologize I
do eight words chairman in eight words
because the United un States has chosen
a pattern of the war on tur that
violates everything the United States
Constitution is supposed to stand for it
is given Comfort to dictators everywhere
to violate human rights and we see that
the results everywhere and really thank
you thank you that is laughter of
appreciation it's a no you it's a
comment you can take it I want to get
this the United States has given support
for dictators to violate human rights
yeah by the war on terror oh that's
exactly correct it's a statement it's a
statement God rolling that was that was
hard work over to this lady who uh will
now be succinct hi I'm Su yra I'm the
member of the chatam house um quick
question um regarding uh reason Japan's
um mve towards the um um rather
right-wing um um the political well they
are clearly manifesting their View and
particularly uh in the way called their
attempt to amend their um Pacific
Constitution
um the meanwhile um they're refusing to
acknowledge their uh military P um
regarding the um the neighboring country
so the question so what what's your view
on
that article nine yes and also the obas
um now seems to be backing up okay so we
you got that one and uh this uh woman
here and then there's a chat it's you
yeah have you got a microphone yeah
where you go name hi there I'm Polly I'm
a reporter for RT in London and RT RT no
Russia Today television and I wanted to
ask how you see the the we get it a lot
actually I know I was just after the
performance I
was um I wanted to ask how you see the
conflict in Crimea playing out both in
the short term and in the long term the
conflict in and over uh Ukraine and
whether that's changed the balance of
power or whether there's anything to say
about the balance of power
yeah yeah that's a quite specific one
and sir no it was actually the man right
in front of him I'm Frid yeah I'm really
sorry but he had it much earlier but
you're enormously kind to give it up so
quickly sir uh Co Yamamoto at Kings
College London just your comment on two
risks I think which have been uh
underlying throughout the talk one is
the uh um supporter of uh repressive
government in no way jumping on your
band bandwagon and join your criticism
of the United States how do we prevent
that the other one is a discount uh of
you as as some someone of more of an
idealist rather than realist how um do
you think we can prevent these risks uh
in addition to our uh individual
conscience or uh our aspiration to
follow your inspirational example um so
this is the question of how do we go
through uh or or disseminate your view
uh in addition to individual
Enlightenment right okay thank you you
two questions not one well let's take
the first one we did actually about
China and so on uh are you an idealist
am I saying marginalized because an
idealist oh there's n Chomsky isn't he
marvelous he keeps us all he keeps us
all in good form but he's he's a
fantasist a moral fantasist would that
be more that's that one would you say
the same about uh iway wayi Shirin abadi
vatslav havil Martin Luther King
people who've tried in their own
countries to move towards greater
freedom and Justice yeah they're
idealists I mean they're trying to
achieve something that's appropriate and
in other states we honor them for it not
in our own of course and it's it's the
same uh iway way is not honored in China
only in the United States and it's uh
that's natural and understandable and uh
it shouldn't happen but we should be
aware of it but I
don't we should apply I mean we it's we
simply have to apply to ourselves the
standards we apply to others that's a
pretty Elementary moral principle pretty
hard easy to say hard to live up to but
very valuable yeah poly um I think it
was the Strategic balance Crimea
changing the Strategic balance bance
question mark not in any any significant
way I mean Crimea was in the Russians
look it was part of the Soviet Union uh
in
1954 without asking the
population uh hush jef who was Ukrainian
handed it over to Ukraine every reason
to believe that the population didn't
want this as I said there had been a
referendum in 1991 which came out pretty
much the same as the recent one that
they didn't want to be part of the
Ukraine but they were just handed over
for Russian state region reasons and
it's U Russia has its major Naval Base
warm water Naval Base inasta pole it's U
generally it's been part of the Russian
kind of the general Russian system the
Takeover of of Crimea by force as I
mentioned is a criminal act one of many
I mentioned one worse one but there are
plenty of others and yes we should not
be in favor of criminal act but in terms
of the Strategic balance it amounts to
essentially nothing if you take a look
the the United States has what are
called red lines lines you can't cross
if you cross those there's a threat of
War just take a look at where those red
lines are they're at the borders of
other states so one of the red lines is
the border of Russia another red lines
is the border of China there's a
conflict developing in the Pacific uh
not in the Eastern Pacific it's not off
the coast of San Francisco there's a
conflict developing in the waters off
the coast of China where China is
attempting you can argue whether it's
right or wrong to
gain control over its major trading
routs of the waters off its Coast which
Japan had pretty much taken over in the
course of Imperial
Conquest I mean Japan has claims vast
areas of the Pacific uh during because
of its Imperial conquests China this was
its Century of
humiliation they don't have them they're
trying to get some of them back you can
like it you can dislike it but that's
where the red line is and that's the way
it's
been all the time I mean it's very
interesting to look at the way American
foreign policy is described the way we
describe it so there's a lot of talk
about American
decline uh what's rarely noticed is that
this decline began in
1945 in 1945 the US had overwhelming
power I there was nothing like it in
history security wealth uh and of course
plan to use it to organize the world
system it began to decline very quickly
there's an event in the west called the
loss of China
1949 the loss of China took place big
attack on on big uh step in American
decline I can't lose your cell phone I
can lose my cell phone in fact they do
it all the time but I can't lose yours
right how could we lose China well
there's only one way if we own it
and after and that's taken for granted
the loss of China is a huge issue in
American domestic policy you know who
was responsible for the loss of China
have be have to go after them you know
McCarthyism and so on when
Kennedy escalated the war in Vietnam we
know from internal records a lot of the
concern was that he might be blamed for
the loss of
Indochina how do you lose Indo China you
know and it's the same all over there's
a premise in the United States accepted
in British Elite circles that the US
owns the world and Britain is U it's
supposedly its partner actually is an
interesting comment on the partnership
of right at the peak of the Cuban
Missile Crisis when Britain's existence
was at stake literally could have been
wiped out by us decisions the US was
refusing to provide information
to Britain McMillan was trying to get
British intelligence to figure out what
was going on and there was a discussion
in highle circles about what was called
the special relationship between the US
and Britain and one high official was
probably Dean anes and said define the
special relationship he said Britain is
our Lieutenant the fashionable word is
partner in Britain in Britain they like
to hear the fashionable word but the big
guy use the word that counts so this is
the US attitude written as a lieutenant
goes along uh and uh it's a conception
of World Order that's pretty striking if
you think about it we're nearly out of
time now have we dealt with article 9 or
do you want to yeah article n yeah well
it's quite precise so yeah okay I mean
it's a in a sentence nearly you know
Japan now happens to be in the hands of
a very kind of an ultra nationalist uh
government prime minister who is clearly
trying to whittle away at article 9 in
fact the pacifist article in the
Constitution uh I think it's a very bad
thing I mean uh people in Asia have some
memories of Japanese
imperialism there's also a for a long
time in Japan there's been kind of an
underplaying of Japanese crimes in Asia
so the
the yanaga was one historian disident
historian who fought hard to try to get
the Japanese textbooks to at least
include the facts and there was some
progress now it's going back again you
know like denying the nuning massacre
things like that this incident was a
beded by the United States when the
United after the war the United States
simply took over Japan
there was supposed to be a Far Eastern
Commission of all the countries that
were involved in the war but they were
all kicked out the US ran it
unilaterally uh there was a peace treaty
with Japan San Francisco peace treaty
1951 the peace
treaty charged Japan with crimes take a
look at it the crimes began on December
7th
1941 there were 10 years of horrendous
crimes before that that but they didn't
count because they were crimes against
Asians what George Orwell called UNP
people December 7th 1941 was different
that was against people uh the structure
of the peace treaty was so outrageous
that independent Asian countries simply
refused to attend like India wouldn't
attend uh Salan attended because it was
a British colony Philippines attended
they had to but any independent asias
refused well okay that sets the basis in
fact you know this famous reverse course
in Japan in
1947 the US essentially restored the
traditional order and undermined the
Democratic elements in society uh and
that helps that lays the basis in which
Japan has been able to maintain these
policies and I think it's it's a pretty
bad thing it doesn't mean we should U
you know praise China for what it's
doing a lot of what it's doing is I
think pretty outrageous like with regard
to Vietnam but that's a different
question uh the uh but as far as Japan's
backing off on its pacifist Constitution
I think that's extremely dangerous I
think we're we're nearly there we're
nearly there there's a question that
occurs to me might be even an unfair one
but sometimes when you listen to you
here you get the impression you you you
began life fully formed with the clarity
of vision
I mean it's amazing and a consistency
and I want to ask you you don't have to
answer Fifth Amendment but do you think
you've ever been wrong about an issue
you know no no they're laughing They're
laughing They're laughing nervously it
is not a lot of it is not a it is not a
COI root into no plenty of times I can
think of case after case I mean take the
worst crime of the postwar ER postor War
era the worst crime was the US attack on
Indochina really horrendous crime that
destroyed three countries they may never
recover Millions of people killed you
know vast Devastation chemical warfare
destroy crops every atrocity you can
think of the time to have become opposed
to that was
1950 I didn't I didn't do anything in
the 1950s it was pretty clear what was
going on it wasn't until the early 60s
when Kennedy sharply escalated the war
that I started trying to talk a little
bit about it and not enough and that was
a bad mistake and there are plenty of
others like it yeah okay look uh he's
there's people waiting for him uh I'm at
this point I I want to just plug chadam
house you know it's a fantastic venue
there are lots of events I don't know
any of them but go on the website you'll
see them H there looks to be a camera
down there which means the if you want
to watch this and catch sight of
yourself when they're looking for
questions but more to the point revisit
it it'll be I presume on a web will it
be on a web or the web
so you'll be able to see it again uh
thank you for being a very disciplined
audience Ron and I am sorry about giving
you a hard time over that question it's
my uh but it was a statement which nor
agreed with so I think he answered every
single one of them it's a prodigious
display and it's also if I might say so
a very entertaining one uh I I think my
name is Connor guti I work at LC I feel
very lucky to have been able to chair
this event I wonder whether you might
now want to join with me in showing your
appreciation of Professor Noam chumsky
done very you go
