that's it's going to be a hard act to
follow but thanks
i guess i have to begin by
saying that the phrase that you
attributed to me was actually
plagiarized
manufacturing consent
yeah it actually comes from walter
lipman who's the
you know the dean of american journalism
in the 20th century he thought it was a
good idea you know
he was coming out in favor of it
but uh
uh it uh it goes without saying that
anything that happens in the united
states has an enormous impact on the
rest of the world
last election for example
and conversely that's important to
remember
what happens in the rest of the world
has uh
cannot fail to have an important
in fact crucial often impact in the
united states
and that happens in several ways
for one thing
it sets constraints on
what even the most powerful state can do
but in a more significant way what
happens elsewhere like here
influences the domestic component
of what the
new york times
ruefully described as the second
superpower
namely world public opinion
after the enormous protests right before
the iraq invasion
it was the first time in
hundreds of years of the history of
europe and its north american offshoots
that a war was protested in fact
massively protested before it was
officially launched and that's a
historic event and it tells us a lot
about
where we've come
and should be encouraging not depressing
take say by comparison
the war what's called the vietnam war
actually the war against south vietnam
that was launched by john f kennedy in
1962
it was brutal and barbaric from the
outset began with
bombing of
unprotected civilian targets chemical
warfare
to destroy food crops so as to starve
out the civilian support for the
indigenous resistance
programs to drive millions of people to
virtual concentration camps or urban
slums to eliminate the popular base for
the resistance
by the time protests reached the
substantial scale
67
the
highly respected and quite hawkish
vietnam specialist
and military historian bernard fall
wondered
quoting him whether vietnam as a
cultural and historic entity would
escape extinction as the countryside
literally dies under the blows of the
largest military machine
ever unleashed on an area of this size
it was particularly south vietnam which
was always the main target of the u.s
assault
and when protest finally did develop
many years too late it was mostly
directed against the peripheral crimes
the extension of the war to the north
and the rest of indochina
these were terrible crimes but lesser
ones
and it's quite important to remember how
much the world has changed since then
through deeply committed popular
struggle it's far too late in developing
but ultimately it was effective
the most interesting part of the
pentagon papers which is rarely
mentioned for good reasons is the last
section pentagon papers ends
middle of 1968
and as many of you will remember or
maybe know if you're too young to
remember
january 68 was the tet offensive
which
convinced
corporate elite in the united states
that the war just wasn't worth it and
the us had
won
many of its objectives it had destroyed
any serious hope of
independent successful development in
vietnam which was its main purpose as in
many other cases and it was just
becoming too costly for the united
states too costly because the rising
anti-war movement which was compelling
the president to
fight what was called a guns and butter
war couldn't declare a national
mobilization
which probably would have been good for
the economy the way it was during the
second world war but had to kind of buy
the population off because there were
just too much disruption
and it was just becoming too costly
that was the ted offensive the
pentagon papers you know kind of
record of the internal pentagon history
that dan ellsberg released
that was it ends a couple of months
after that
and it turns out that right after the
tet offensive the president wanted to
send 200 000 more troops to
south vietnam
and the
joint chiefs of staff objected they
didn't want to do it and they refused
and the reason they said is that they
would need those troops for civil
disorder control in the united states
because of the rising protests among
women young people
minorities in fact a large part of the
population so it's just too dangerous to
send more troops into china
that continued and grew
over the next 10 years elite groups
thought they had it under control when
ronald reagan came into office he tried
to duplicate what
john f kennedy had done in south vietnam
20 years earlier
in fact
reagan probably didn't know what was
going on but his advisors uh
his planners uh try just point by point
duplicated it this is 1981 and the
target then was central america
under what was called incidentally a war
against terror
was declared in 1981 not in 2001.
the
they had to back off
because there was just too much
spontaneous protest
from church groups from by then and all
over mainstream
the mainstream of the country not just
you know young people and so on
so they backed off and they turned to
what was called clandestine war
clandestine war is a technical term that
means a war that everybody knows about
except the population of the united
states
and
they don't know it for a good reason
which
some people have something to answer for
about
so the reagan administration
fought this clandestine war with an in a
huge international terror network
so the cover war on terror or well would
have appreciated
that was terrible enough a couple
hundred thousand people were killed four
countries devastated but it wasn't b-52s
which are much worse and it wasn't mass
murder operations which happened to be
peaking in 1969
at the time when john kerry was deep in
the mekong delta in the south which by
then had been largely devastated
the popular reaction to
even the clandestine war which as it was
called also broke new ground in history
another historically unprecedented
development that was the origin of the
solidarity movements
for central america
which were coming right out of the
mainstream
thousands in fact tens of thousands of
people from the united states actually
went to help the victims
that had never happened in the history
of
european imperialism or its north
american offshoots
and by now they're all over the world
that's again something entirely new in
western history and another testimony to
the success of these movements of which
there are many and the state managers
are well aware of it
when a new president comes in
the first thing he does has done is a
intelligence assessment the intelligence
community as it's called gives an
assessment of the world situation and
george bush number one
he did it too
so in 1989 there was an assessment of
the world situation and a piece of it
leaked
somebody usually don't hear about these
things for like 40 years if ever
but a
little part of it leaked and was
published
it was kind of
hushed up
it was an interesting part somebody
obviously in the pentagon or cia or
somewhere didn't like it and leaked it
to the press
it was a discussion of
the kinds of wars that the u.s would be
fighting
wars against what it called much weaker
enemies
those are the only kind of wars you
fight if you have any sense
wars against much weaker enemies it said
in the case of such wars the united
states would have to win them
rapidly and decisively because there
simply is no political support for
anything more than that
it's not like the 60s when you could go
on for years and years with no protest
and destroy a country before it
significantly develops
well that's significant i mean the world
is a pretty awful place and you can look
at it and get pretty depressed
but it's far better than it was
yesterday
and that's not only with regard to the
unwillingness to tolerate aggression but
also in innumerable other ways
many of which we now just take for
granted which is good we should take it
for granted but we should also remember
that not many years ago it wasn't like
that
well these there are very important
lessons and they should always be
foremost in our mind
uh we had a little more time i
had intended to say a couple of words
about canada's role in the indo-china
wars which is pretty interesting but
i'll skip that i'll say i'm being polite
but you should know about it if you
don't already it's pretty ugly
well without
forgetting the
very significant progress towards more
civilized societies which has taken
place in the past years and crucially
the reasons for it namely popular
engagement and struggle
let's focus nevertheless on the present
and on the
topic that was suggested for this
evening the notions of imperial
sovereignty that are now being crafted
it's not surprising that as the
population becomes more civilized
power systems become more extreme in
their efforts to control
the great beast as the
founding fathers of u.s society called
the people the hated and feared people
the conceptions of
popular sovereignty that are being
crafted by the
radical status reactionaries of the bush
administration are in fact so extreme
that they've drawn
unprecedented criticism in the most
sober and respected establishment
circles
actually pretty helpful to people like
me instead of
quoting you know sort of far out types
you can quote the most respectable
mainstream journals and they're saying
more
you know stronger things than you might
have said yourself
uh the administration's ideas of
presidential sovereignty were
transmitted to the president
uh by the
newly appointed attorney general alberto
gonzalez at that time he's the
president's counsel
and he's depicted now as a moderate in
the press
uh his
views on this are discussed by the
very respected constitutional
law professor sanford levinson
in the current issue of the journal of
the american academy of arts and
sciences you can't get more respectable
than that
levinson writes that the
conception being
crafted by the justice department
transmitted by gonzales
is based on the principle that
quoting there exists no norm that is
applicable to chaos
and that quote as
levinson comments is from carl schmidt
who was the leading
german philosopher of law during the
nazi period
he levinson describes him as the true
aminos greece of the bush administration
the administration
advised by gonzales quoting levinson has
articulated a view of presidential
authority that is all too close to the
power that schmidt was willing to accord
his own fuhrer
one rarely hears words like that from
the heart of the establishment
the same issue of that
super respectable journal
has an article by two leading strategic
analysts on what's called the
transformation of the military it's
another component of the new doctrines
of
imperial sovereignty that are being
crafted that's the rapid expansion of
offensive weaponry including the
militarization of space
in this case joined apparently by canada
and
other measures that are designed to
place the entire world at risk of
instant annihilation
and these have elicited the anticipated
reactions by potential targets russia
and china
who are developing their own
offensive weapons free in order to
overwhelm it
these two analysts conclude that the u.s
programs may lead to in their words
ultimate doom
and they express their hope that a
coalition of
peace-loving
nations will coalesce
as a counter
to u.s
militarism and aggressiveness a
coalition led by china
we've come to a pretty past
when such sentiments are voiced in sober
and respectable circles which aren't
given to hyperbole
and when their faith in u.s democracy is
so slight
that they look to china to save us from
marching towards ultimate doom
and it's up to the second superpower to
decide whether that contempt for the
great beast
is warranted
