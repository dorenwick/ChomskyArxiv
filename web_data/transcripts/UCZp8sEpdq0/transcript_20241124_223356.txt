the standard way to introduce my champ
sleeve is to put in the up times we say
that is arguably the most important
living intellectual the New York Times
asked how can he say such silly things
about the police the foreign policy of
the United States
Chomsky's undoubtedly those
controversial living intellectually he
stood commercial on the height when
speaks of free markets Western
comparison of his head but also on the
neck when he speaks of fascinating human
nature of freedom of speech for people
are not on the net
but we discuss on that tomorrow today
which become a current crisis war and
social change
[Music]
what's happening has happened many times
in the past it commonly becomes
difficult or impossible to
salvage your favorite dictator and when
that happens there's a familiar plan
that goes into effect this time - first
to try to sustain them as long as
possible
no good okay they try to
sustain them as long as you can when if
it becomes impossible maybe the army
turns against them or the business
classes turn against them then what you
do is send them away somewhere in the
case for example of the guy in Haiti put
him on a
American
military jet plane flying to France with
half the Treasury in his pocket in the
case of others some other thing
but get rid of them issue the ringing
declarations about your passionate love
of democracy and how much you in favor
of the people and then try to restore as
much of the previous order as possible
it happens over and over and there are
actually two factors that predict quite
well how hard the Western powers will
work to sustain the dictator that one
factor is how much oil they have the
other factor is how obedient they've
been in the case of countries that have
a tremendous amount of oil and have been
very obedient then the effort to sustain
the dictator is very powerful in fact
we've just seen it in the past few days
the Saudi Arabia is the most obedient
that has the most oil so that's where
the most effort goes
what about Libya Libya has plenty of oil
but it doesn't meet the condition of
minions the
Qaddafi is been pretty independent in
many ways since
since he took power I was a brutal
dictator and all kind of atrocities for
years but he has oil and he's a little
independent and that leads to
conflicting policies so the Western
powers have strongly supported it but
also he's not too obedient so he's often
attacked sometimes directly attack for
example in 1986 the US you know I'm sure
bombed
Tripoli in Benghazi in other
[Music]
Libyan cities that was a very remarkable
bombing campaign and also tells us a lot
about the media it was the first and
only bombing in history that was planned
for primetime television and I mean it
precisely
in the United States at that time all
television channels had their major news
programs at 7:00 p.m. in the evening and
the bombing was carefully timed so that
would be at exactly 7:00 p.m. I don't
think a single newspaper anywhere in the
world as far as I saw bothered to notice
that the bombing was timed for primetime
news and that everyone just happened to
be there waiting for and expecting it
well that was an unusual but it didn't
have any credible pretext but Libya is a
easy kind of punching back you know no
it's no support so you can do anything
you like and that's one of a number of
cases so it's been a kind of a mixed
story with Qaddafi and right now that's
the one country where the West is
calling for supporting the rebellion
none of the others the others you just
we have to try to protect the dictator
and the regime but if you have to
have some words favoring the uprising
have the words but try not to do
anything about it support for democracy
that's the province of ideologists and
propagandists but it's not part of the
real world
[Music]
hello everybody and welcome to this
special evening of questions and answers
with Noam Chomsky
you're a very radical defender of his
speech but what about incitement to
racial hatred do you think that this
would be tolerated do you think that
given she hops past want to tolerate
expressions of anti-semitism
isn't that a form of insult of the dead
and what do you reply to those who say
never again
should
incitement to racial racial hatred be
tolerated now shouldn't be tolerated
nor should incitement to war be
tolerated or all sorts of other speech
should not be tolerated but there's a
gap the gap
between not tolerating something and
granting the state the power to
determine what speech is legitimate or
even worse to determine what our
historical truths I don't think we
should grant the holy state the right to
decide what history is and to punish
deviation from it and to decide what
kinds of
statements are legitimate and what kind
aren't I don't want the state to have
that brought that power I Sonos sure
don't tolerate it but don't grant the
state the right to determine what's
acceptable and to punish it that's a
critical gap which unfortunately is not
made clear in Europe I'm afraid I don't
know Belgian law so maybe I'm wrong but
I would guess that if I stood up right
now and said here that
King Leopold didn't kill ten million
people at the Congo he only killed five
million or if I said that the Belgian
government didn't purposely murder
Lumumba and throw the Congo into total
disaster including what's happening
right this minute namely the worst
atrocities in the world have being
carried out with the cooperation of
multinational corporations in eastern
Congo so that you can have cell phones
if I were to deny that
doubt that I'd be brought the court you
can tell me if I'm wrong I suspect that
that's considered good
and that's that's that's pretty serious
now these are some of the worst crimes
in modern history and they reach right
to this minute they're going on right
now while we're talking in eastern Congo
which the worst atrocities in the world
all traceable to these activities very
recent activities well that again
illustrates the varies that give many
other examples these
selectivity reveals extreme hypocrisy if
there was time I would go through the
very interesting history of how
Holocaust denial became a crime in fact
just briefly speaking at a time when it
was possible to save Holocaust victims
to save survivors there was almost no
interest in doing so I
could explain it if you like
years later when Holocaust victims could
be exploited as justification for
persecution of others then it became a
big issue that's exactly what troubled
people like Israel Shaka and
[Applause]
the fact that the treads ture are very
survival are so acute and real ads to a
certain puzzlement of many admirers of
your work and thought they deplore that
you have almost always been very
reluctant to respond to those demands
that are often put to you regarding what
and can and should be done and that you
typically won't answer them beyond
generalities such as organized
one could argue that these requests are
both legitimate and strategically
important and more ever that your
socialist libertarian ideals should
inspire you some answers answers that
could today for example put on the
agenda to takeover of workplaces as a
live option so those answer would of
course be tentative and modest answers
but they would nevertheless be answers
and I think they are much needed today
you seem to think otherwise why I mean
if that's the impression I give it's my
problem it's my mistake as far as I can
see and I think there's a partial truth
to it every topic that I've ever spoken
and written about as far as I can think
of I have suggested definite solutions
but when you get down to the tactical
level like what should we do tomorrow
about this problem then it's true I
can't give answers and I don't think
anyone can because it depends very much
on circumstances and when people come to
me and ask well what should I do to
change the immunitech the environment I
can't say depends where they are and who
they are what they're facing what
they're willing to do who they're trying
to reach and so on there aren't general
answers to tactical questions there are
very specific answers which have to do
with immediate circumstances
including what the individual in
question is willing to undertake I don't
expect everyone to be willing to
undertake resistance or civil
disobedience even or even large-scale
protest those are choices and within the
range of choices about yourself and the
circumstances you face tactics have to
be thought through carefully an advice
from the outside is meaningless
we shouldn't exaggerate 1968 that was a
very brief moment
if you go if you take a look at the
1960s altogether there's a pretty
passive period the germs were there but
it began to take off in the 1970s and
in the early 1970s that began to develop
further along with other things and had
a big impact but the and then it went on
from there some of the environmental
movement began in the early seventies
the anti-nuclear movement really took
off in the 1980s the global justice
movements which are something new they
began in the late 90s and
overall when you try to evaluate the
conditions I think there's more activism
today than there was in the sixties
[Music]
sq+ fool for a TV reporter lee ji-su
improve support issues little admit the
executive whisking for work approach a
pretty visitor we need to be you see me
que pueda project
I don't I think it's a matter of
emphasis not of choice I mean you
basically have both I suppose you really
believe any long term called utopian
vision you still have to take actions in
the present you have to do something
right now
which is
short-term connected with existing
conditions and which you hope may lay
the basis for moving on towards your
long-term vision on the other hand if
you if your
point of view or perception or whatever
is more concentrated on the present
every small thing you do is guided in
some fashion by long-term conception
where you're trying to go
so
I love it here depends what you mean by
hammock ISM and libertarian socialism I
mean from I mean if it's
a position I think as I've written it
seems to me a kind of a long term
tendency and human thought in action
which takes new forms all the time then
it's basically driven by
critical analysis of
structures of hierarchy and domination
it it holds that they are not
self-justifying they have to be
justified and they have a burden proof
whatever they are whether it's in a
patriarchal family
community international society whatever
it is if somebody's giving orders and
somebody's taking them that has to be
justified and if it can't be justified
which is most of the time not always
sometimes it can be if it can't be
justified then it should be dismantled
as far as that's anarchism and from that
point of view I think everybody is
should be in most people are enemies
there are a lot of questions here that I
think that are just worried about the
fact that after the
collapse of socialism there's nothing
really
with regard to socialism I think what
really happened here and I think this is
a serious fault of the left I felt this
all my life since I was a child
way back is that the two major
propaganda systems in the world the huge
Western system and the minor the
backward
Russian based system those two systems
of propaganda disagreed on almost
everything but they agreed on one thing
they agreed that the Soviet Union was
socialist and that's just false the
Bolshevik Revolution was an attack on
socialism
in fact the first thing that Lenin and
Trotsky did after they took power was to
dismantle the socialist institutions
that had developed during the pre
takeover period they had their own
reasons for it but you know
understandable reasons and their version
of Marxism that's what you should have
done but in fact they did they dismantle
the Soviets the factory councils of
course the Constitutional Convention
ventia the convention and they just they
worked to turn the working-class into
what they called a labor army in any
event both of the propaganda systems
ident dis chose to identify
socialism with Russian tyranny the
Russians did it so as to
adopt of course the German revolution
didn't take place so they had to shift
their policies but
the Russians accepted that in fact
advanced it in order to gain the moral
prestige of the concepts of socialism
the West did it in order to defame
socialism but they both did it and in
fact it was a you know when both of the
world's propaganda systems agree on
something it's kind of hard for people
to disentangle themselves from it and I
remember fighting through this when I
was a child I mean by time I was 12
years old and sort of understood it but
it was hard and right to the end in the
late 80s I I was asked by a Marxist
journal to write an article on
what it would mean if the Soviet Union
collapsed it was pretty clear already it
was on its last legs and I wrote an
article called the Soviet Union versus
socialism they wouldn't publish it you
finally got published in an anarchist
journal our generation you know but
because they could not because of
censorship they could understand it no
but I think it was correct and I think
we're now suffering from the
consequences of that
like the questioner said the notion of
socialism is discredited because of its
firm association with a tyrannical
system which was strongly anti socialist
all the way through

the ratios of the use of the world are

not easy capable so is prickly but
position power without equality so
enemies before really believe in our
ability
for me you religious belief doesn't
exist in fact I
became an atheist at about age 10 I
remember exactly how it happened my
grandfather was ultra-religious in fact
he was living in the 17th century in a
little village in the Ukraine and I
don't think he ever left it even after
50 years in the United States I remember
visiting once with my father it was my
father's father we went to visit his
family all very Orthodox on one of the
holidays and I noticed that my
grandfather was smoking and you know I
knew the the laws you know the laws say
that there's no difference between
a holiday and Sabbath except with regard
to eating so for example on the unknown
Sabbath he can't make a fire to eat but
on the holidays you can make a fire to
eat but otherwise it's the same so I
turned to my father and I asked him how
can he be smoking and my father quoted
the line from the Talmud which I knew
you know when I just mentioned and said
he's decided that smoking is eating so I
realized right then
big insight religion is based on the
idea that God is an idiot and you can
fool them and when you think about it
that's all of organized religion I mean
nobody can live by God's precepts so in
one way or another all of organized
religion is based on the assumption that
God is so stupid you can't see what
you're doing and I think well if that's
religion why should I pay attention to
it and afterwards I learn more of it I
think it's basically correct on the
other hand if people want to be part of
that that's their choice as long as it
doesn't influence that affect anyone
else so if my neighbors are like my
grandfather or something else okay and
it's fine long as it doesn't affect my
life and my choices so in that sense yes
there ought to be sharp separation
between church and state and more
generally between religious practices
and other people's
decisions and choices and I think that
can work out amicably
like for example I don't agree with
you know there's a new wave of militant
atheists who think you have to
approach religious people and convince
them that they're wrong and I don't
agree with that I mean if some mother
let's say
hopes that she'll see her dying child in
heaven it's not up to me to give her a
lecture in epistemology that's she can
with that comforter fine not my business
