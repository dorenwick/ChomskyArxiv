we're now joined by professor noam
chomsky he's professor emeritus of
linguistics at mit and the author of
many books on politics and u.s foreign
policy including fateful triangle
deterring democracy hegemony or survival
and the collection 911 he also has a
piece forthcoming in jacobin's sister
publication catalyst titled an era of
impunity is over professor chomsky
welcome to the jacobin show
thanks to be with you again
so professor we're approaching the 20th
anniversary of 9 11 um which of course
means that there are now adults in the
u.s who were not yet born when 9 11
happened and i think when you add to
that the fact that obama ended the war
on terror at least on paper and then of
course last week biden officially
withdrew all troops from afghanistan and
officially ended the war um i suppose
the question is do you think we've
arrived at the end of an era or perhaps
more specifically do you think that
we're witnessing the end of american
empire or at least some kind of new
stage
i think it'll have
practically no effect on
u.s imperial policy
if you look at the
massive commentary
on uh
of course which is pouring out
it's almost entirely about what was the
cost to us
okay
i find virtually nothing about what was
the cost to afghans
there are a few interesting articles
which are appearing
showing that what the
press understood
very well 20 years ago
was
but were ridiculing
was in fact correct
namely that there was
no
reasonable basis for the war in the
first place
that
uh the
osama bin laden
they aren't saying it he was a suspect
when they started bombing
well
if there's a suspect who you want to
apprehend
uh you carry out a
small police operation
uh probably with the cooperation of the
taliban who were eager to get rid of him
but
couldn't just throw him out for simple
reasons of tribal tribal
uh
policy
but they would have probably cooperated
he could have apprehended him then
worked to trying to find out if he was
actually responsible
which they didn't know
in fact that was conceded many months
later
i think it was eight months later that
uh robert mueller head of the fbi
gave his
first
extensive
press conference
in which he said we this is after
probably the most intensive
investigation in the world
international investigation
said that we
assumed that
al qaeda and
bin laden were responsible for you know
2011 we haven't able to establish it yet
that was eight months later
so first you bomb
and
uh
then you look and see if there's any
reason we now know it's now being
conceded
that the taliban had in fact surrendered
meaning that
uh
of course bin laden would have been
handed over
but rumsfeld
proudly announced we do not negotiate
surrenders
we're going to smash you to pieces
they asked that
their terms were that
the leading figures in the taliban be
allowed to live with dignity
why not they hadn't done anything
the story was they had
uh harbored a terrorist
we don't do that
i mean we harbor some of the worst war
criminals in modern times
including people who are recognized to
be terrorists
like orlando bush
uh
tarius persona
cuban terrorists living who were living
happily in
uh
florida under u.s protection
there's no question nobody doubted they
were terror they were responsible for
among other things the
bombing of a tubana airliner in which
70 or 80 people were killed
it's called terrorism if someone else
does it
if we do it it's
fun and games
so
it was no reason not to allow them to
live in dignity
uh
except for what was
explained right away
in october
by
the most prominent figure of the
anti-taliban afghan resistance
of the
he was interviewed by a
highly regarded
middle east central asia specialist
anatoly
the british press
it was asked his response to the
invasion was
he bitterly condemned it
as did other
afghan
anti-taliban activists he said
the americans just want to show their
muscle
and scare everyone
uh
they'll kill a lot of afghans
they'll undermine our efforts to
overthrow the taliban from within he
outlined ways that he could do that
which is indeed what happened he was
soon killed by the taliban
but
he said the americans don't care
but they just wanna as he said show
their muscle
well that's pretty much uh rumsfeld's
position at the time
we're not gonna negotiate surrender
we're gonna show we can
attack and destroy defenseless people
that's what we're good at
now it's being
conceded in the press
they knew it at the time i was writing
about a time you didn't have to be a
genius
uh okay
anybody who was pointing it out
either they ignored or ridiculed
now they're conceding that it was
correct
okay
is that the end of the empire no it's
just saying look we did something that
was too costly to us
so now we'll do things better
yeah i wanted to follow up on that
because you've mentioned in other
interviews that a lot of the framework
that people use to understand withdrawal
from afghanistan is comparing the cost
of the war to potential domestic
spending for social welfare programs or
other things that could benefit
americans
um you've obviously pointed out that
this is a moral issue that we owe
afghanistans after decades of destroying
their infrastructure decades of murder
decades of terror
what's a better framework to talk about
ending us military campaigns and as a
follow-up what do we owe
afghanis
um as we
withdraw and and what can the left do to
put pressure on the us government to
make sure
that we are in some way repairing the
vast amounts of destruction that have
happened there
well there's some
concrete things
oh you're right about the framework
that's the way it's discussed and it's
true that the
wars the crazy war spending in general
uh
780 billion dollar war pentagon budget
is first of all endangering us very much
and it's also
taking away resources that are badly
needed for other purposes
that's quite apart from uh
afghanistan so that point is correct but
that's not the framework for
looking at what happens when we attack
and destroy other countries
iraq afghanistan
yemen right now a
whole long list
yes we're responsible for
doing something to try to
help them
escape from the wreckage for which we
are substantially responsible
there are concrete things
one is
we should be admitting afghan refugees
no bureaucratic castles no
uh
putting them off from some other place
they should be treated decently
and incidentally that's not the whole
story
there are plenty of people right now
not very far from where i live in tucson
who are still escaping
the ravages
of the
reagan's brutal terrorist wars in
central america they're fleeing from the
wreckage
what do we do
we block them
we bribe mexico
to keep them from ever reaching our
borders
we
when they get here we stick them in what
amounts to concentration camps we were
don't have to go through the details you
know better than i do
well okay
not
hardly the way to deal with the crimes
that we've committed
most of the ref
turned for a while maybe still
the plurality of the refugees were
coming from honduras
that's a reflection of president obama
and hillary clinton's
uh recognition of the military junta
which overthrew a mildly reformist
government
the us was probably alone in that
the coup was denounced all over
uh clinton and obama wouldn't call it a
coup
because that meant we'd have they'd have
to stop funding the military that was
covered that was throwing out the
government and
turning honduras into one of the murder
capitals of the world i ran a fake
election which everyone
denounced
obama clinton praised it as an important
step to democracy now people are fleeing
so what do we do well take a look at the
border that's what we do
so yes it's much more than afghans
second thing we should do is
put an end to this disgraceful
program of putting sanctions on
afghanistan
i don't like the taliban
you don't like them
but that's no reason for punishing
afghans
they need the humanitarian aid badly
it's afghan people who are starving
not the taliban leaders
sanctions in general very generally
uh punish the population
not the leadership
that was true of the
sanctions on iraq
sanctions on iran
on cuba on venezuela
it's just a way of punishing the people
we actually know the reasons they're
sometimes even announced so in the case
of cuba
which is one of the worst atrocities of
the modern world
the u.s began back in 1960
to punish cubans
cubans not the leadership
for the reason that was explicitly
stated by
state department representatives they
recognized that
then castro was a lot was very popular
and the overweight only way to overthrow
the government
was to
foment discontent among the population
make life so impossible that people
would overthrow the government of course
it wasn't the only way
kennedy also launched a major terrorist
war
which practically brought the world to
nuclear disaster in 1962
speak of harboring terrorists
then
but the sanctions then aren't designed
they were intensified by clinton
when cuba was in a desperate position
after the russians pulled out
uh
clinton outflanked bush from the right
to increase
the sanctions
so as to starve the population and beat
them into submissions or they'll
overthrow the government
that's exactly what's going on now
okay so incidentally the united states
the only country in the world
that can impose sanctions
and the sanctions are third-party
sanctions
everyone has to obey them
or else they get tossed out of the
international financial system
us is alone in the world in the capacity
to do that
major form of state terrorism
uh
case of afghanistan coming along as
another one we should
unblock
the imf and world bank funding
they're they're blocking funding of
course under u.s pressure
uh that should be stopped
we should make every possibility for
the taliban
to somehow and the population
to somehow
solve their own problems in whatever way
they can not a good way
uh
we've
there might have been there would have
been better ways i think starting back
actually starting back in late
uh not the late 1980s
for example it's touching to see the uh
concern for women's rights now
everybody's concerned with women's
rights so wonderful and touching
what happened in the late 1980s
when the russians
had a regime in place in a jeep regime
which was protecting women's rights
the women were
going to university wearing whatever
clothes they want they did have problems
the problems were
the u.s backed
islamic
maniacs like
gulbanin hekmatyar who were throwing
acid in the faces of women with the
wrong
clothes
well
that was the late 80s
actually that was written about
by very credible people
russell basu leading international
feminist
woman who organized the
international year of women in 1974 she
was the
un rapporteur for women's rights in
afghanistan she wrote articles about
this
sent them to u.s journals
wouldn't publish them even this magazine
wouldn't publish a
wrong story you know
for not supporting women's rights now
so of course it was a russian-run regime
now
we're concerned with women's rights yes
very moving
i want to follow up on that because um
you know as you were just alluding to i
think when biden announced the
withdrawal of troops there was suddenly
this wave of media commentary uh you
know talking as you said about women and
girls and what kind of fate they might
face under the taliban um you know uh uh
talking about how there was almost
certainly going to be a humanitarian
crisis in afghanistan following the
withdrawal and as you pointed out i
think that if there's anything the last
20 or more years have taught us it's to
be it's that we should be critical or
suspicious at least of this idea of
so-called humanitarian intervention um
and i've also noticed a lot of
progressives even saying or invoking the
pottery barn rule which is you break it
you buy it right and i think the idea is
that they don't feel that it's right for
the u.s to create this disaster in
afghanistan and then just pack up and
leave um so i in in light of all of this
commentary i'm wondering if there are
other humanitarian projects that you
think progressives should be supporting
that uh aside from you know ending
sanctions
and uh admitting more refugees that
don't fall into this trap of continuing
the intervention
well first of all i should say that
i'm sure there are people on the ground
in afghanistan
who really are committed
to human
rights to
rights of women rights of others
but they're not the policy makers
that's always true there are plenty of
good people
who are working on the ground just as
there were under the russian
intervention good people working on the
ground concerned with women's rights
concerned with human rights
didn't justify the invasion but that was
happening but we're talking about policy
not
but people who are trying to do
something
the first
step in humanitarian intervention
is to stop destroying
if we can stop destroying
terrorizing using our muscle to
intimidate everyone whatever the
consequences that'll be a big step
forward
then if we can get that far
you can start thinking what we can do
that might be of some value
and there are things
so take
george w bush who was
responsible for the invasion of
afghanistan and the
invasion of iraq that followed later
millions of people killed countries
destroyed the whole region
uh wrecked through
uh
ethnic conflict that didn't exist before
but he did some good things
his uh
health programs in africa for example
were quite helpful
and
okay fine that's humanitarian
intervention
support some health programs in africa
that we could carry out a humanitarian
program right now
by making vaccines available
to latin america
caribbean
africa and asia
actually the us is
doing a little better than europe is on
this
europe is even worse than us
in many respects
biden has at least taken some small
steps but not the major steps the steps
called for by the
people's vaccine movement
freeing up
the
patenting exorbitant intellectual
property rights
patent rights
that not only patent
the product but also the process
something new introduced by
clinton and other neoliberal fanatics in
the uh world trade organization rules
radical violation of free trade
never existed in the past
ridiculous
rights that support
huge profits for
drug monopolies oh well we can eliminate
that
allow other countries to
manufacture the
vaccines which were mostly created on
public funding anyway
let other countries
uh investigate them their own engineers
can
probably figure out better processes
than the drug companies have make them
available to the countries that need
them you could do that
as i say europe's even worse than we are
but that's no justification
but that would be humanitarian
intervention
uh
i mean eliminating oh take say cuba
one of the worst atrocities of the
modern age
the whole world
literally is opposed strongly to what
we're doing
last vote at the u.n was 184-2
israel has to go along with the u.s
because
it's client state they do what we say
nobody else would
does it make any difference does it even
get reported
i mean
just tighten the grips you know to make
it to punish them
punish them for standing up to us
for what the state department back in
the 60s called
successful defiance
of u.s policies
going back to the monroe doctrine
the 1820s we're not going to let anybody
get away with that
make up all sorts of stories about human
rights if you like
there are human rights violate abuses in
cuba
in fact some of the worst in the
hemisphere
they're taking place in the southeast
corner of cuba a place called
guantanamo which the us took at gunpoint
refuses to give back
probably the worst human rights
certain way but beyond any human rights
in cuba maybe in the hemisphere okay so
yes let's stop violating human rights
viciously
in places we've stolen from cuba at
gunpoint and maintained
because it holds a major port
and it prevents cuban development and
therefore harms the cuban people so
maybe they'll overthrow their government
okay we can stop all of that and be
humanitarian uh intervention you can
look around the world and find endless
things like that
uh actual humanitarian intervention
it barely exists
there's a lot of scholarship on this
incidentally
and it's try it's a very i've reviewed a
lot of it it's very hard to find an
authentic case of humanitarian
intervention
of course every
great power
intervention is called humanitarian
that's universal
when hitler invaded poland it was
to protect people from the wild terror
of the poles
in fact if we had records from attila
the hun would probably be humanitarian
okay but we can put that aside
look at the actual cases
really hard to find an authentic one in
the entire historical record
states are not
moral agents
it's more they act for the interests of
their own dominant classes
overwhelmingly you can find a few
exceptions here and there like
bush's uh
health program in africa
but
you really have to look forward
yeah the um
case that you were making about
humanitarian intervention by um
freeing the patents
and allowing foreign governments to
make the vaccine
is particularly interesting in light of
the fact that the u.s was running a fake
vaccination program in pakistan to try
to get information
about osama bin laden and it undermined
real humanitarian efforts to give people
medical care and so you see that there
are a few wings of u.s imperialism one
is financial one is military might and
the other is medical care and it's
coming to a head during the pandemic in
a horrifying way because you you have a
government that has systematically
undermined the trust of its medical
facilities and medical interventions
domestically and abroad and now is the
moment when the united states could be
poised to
actually do good on a mass scale with
the vast amounts of wealth and privilege
and resources this country has and even
if it were to do that it's hard to think
that these other
countries could trust those efforts
after years and years and years of this
uh kind of brutal bait-and-switch
campaigning and trickery
and i wanted to talk about the ways in
which the u.s media rehabilitates this
image so one particular example i think
key example from this time is george
bush who
was rehabilitated in the eyes of the
liberal establishment he started from he
started out as evil incarnate
um
rushing us into a war we had no business
starting into two wars we had no
business starting then he was turned
into a kind of bumbling oaf that ran
interference for like dick cheney who
was the mastermind behind the scenes and
now he's become a sort of lovable folksy
painter friend of michelle obama
um we've seen the media talking about
how biden
botched the withdrawal and and they're
saying that he can't recover from this
and maybe this will be a turning point
in public opinion um it could crush the
democrats uh chances in later elections
but bush has escaped
it seems any kind of blame for his role
in
for his role as a war criminal
can you talk about the way that the
media
um sort of whitewashes its own recent
history and also why why does it do that
take
henry kissinger
honored
one of the worst war criminals in modern
history
uh
it's hard to even
uh
take say
cambodia
1970 uh kissinger
loyally
followed his master richard nixon
and transmitted orders
of a kind that i don't think ever have
appeared in the historical record
orders to the american air force
said
massive bombing campaign in cambodia
anything that flies against anything
that moves
see if you can find an analog
to that in the historical record
among the nazis among anyone
well and it wasn't just words
it led to a horrendous bombing campaign
horrific bombing campaign
which turned the khmer rouge at the time
had been a
small guerrilla group a couple thousand
people by the end of the bombing
campaign which devastated rural cambodia
there were hundreds of thousands of
enraged peasants
well then came
ugly actions which we can blame on them
okay but that's
one henry kissinger go to india henry
kissinger supported
the pakistani
destruction of east bengal
huge number of people killed maybe a
million or more
he threatened india with punishment if
india dared to try to put an end to the
huge slaughter
what were the reasons
uh
he didn't want to under he had a planned
uh
photo up
where he was going to secretly
go to china
and meet
you know the
mao and shake hands and would be
detanged would be very exciting and he
had to go through pakistan to get there
and all this slaughter was
undermining his photo of
okay so let's kill
a million bengalis
what about
chile
kissinger was the point man
pressing hard
for the overthrow of the
allende government
two tracks one track was
just straight and
violence you know military coup then
there was a soft track
make the economy scream
make it impossible for people to live
okay
they finally got what they wanted
instituted a vicious dictatorship
which incidentally
was the first 911.
what happened in 2001 was the second
911.
the first one was much worse
by any measure
if we
translate it to per capita terms which
is the right way it would be as if on
what we call 911
30 000 people had been killed outright
uh
500 000 had been tortured
uh the government was overthrown a
vicious dictatorship instituted
uh
terror torture horrors you know
celebrated
not only
by the
by the united states celebrated it
uh poured funds in
to
help the new dictatorship
uh international
agencies did the same they'd been
withholding funds from my
poured them in
the
neo-liberals
people have been running the world for
the last 40 years
loved it
they moved in
to advise the government
friedrich hayek the
moral leader of neoliberalism
visited and said
he was
impressed by the
freedom under pinochet said he couldn't
find a single person
in chile who thought he didn't think
there was more freedom under pinochet
dictatorship than
under allende somehow he couldn't hear
the
cries of anguish from the
torture chambers and then via grimaldi
and others
well
that's the reaction to the first 9 11.
i'm sure there are
jihadis who are who celebrated the
second 9 11. we think they're terrible
we're much worse you know
take a look at ourselves
is anybody going to talk about that on
the anniversary of 9 11
uh
maybe you will
i will
a handful of other people will be
denounced of course
but it's true
that was the first 911 much worse
than what happened in september
2001.
uh okay
goes on
uh so if you want to know
what we can do we can begin
by educating ourselves
by rising
to some
minimal
moral level
so we can pay attention to what we do
and what we have done
just take this notion of forever wars
that's being bandied about
uh biden ended the forever wars
when did the forever wars start
well 1783
1783
the british
pulled out
that freed the colonists from the yoke
that the british had imposed
they had prevented
the colonists
from invading
what was called indian country the
indian nations
to the west of the appalachian mountains
the british had blocked that
colonists weren't accepting that
certainly not people like george
washington
major land speculator
wanted to go out and exterminate the
indians who we said were will disappear
they are like wolves they will disappear
like the wolves you know george
washington
immediately the colonists launched
murderous brutal wars against the indian
nations
extermination
dispersal
treaties
broken i mean every horror you can think
of
they knew what they were doing
the
the
leading figure the intellectual
architect of manifest destiny john
quincy adams
in his later years he
lamented
what he called the fate of that
hapless race
of native americans who we are
exterminating with such
malicious atrocities that was long after
his own contributions major
contributions to the process
and that was before the worst of it then
it went on to california where it was
truly genocidal
well we finally uh
there's a
famous diplomatic history of
you can buy a copy of it the well-known
diplomatic history of the united states
by thomas bailey
who
discusses this says he says it was
defensive and he said after
the colonists got their freedom
they turned to the task of
i'm quoting
filling trees and indians
and expanding to their natural borders
meanwhile picking up half of mexico in
the process
uh
robbing hawaii from its natives
that's forever wars
the united states has been a war
probably every year since it was founded
well there were some victims what about
asking them
about the costs
they have voices
most of them were exterminated but
there's some who are left and they left
records so we can ask about the forever
wars
uh
nobody's gonna ask that i don't think
it's the forever wars that cost us too
much
so there's a
a good article in the current issue of
foreign affairs one of the lead articles
main establishment journal that's about
it's called something like the cost of
the afghan war to the united states
yes
it's a very serious cost trillions of
dollars
to the united states
about the
people who we've been
exterminating and attacking and
destroying for 250 years
ever since the country was
founded goes on
there's an article in the new york times
today by a nice person
samuel moyne good
decent guy
about how the united states is turning
to more humanitarian wars
says they're still terrible but they're
more humanitarian than before
and he gives an example
george bush is georgia what first bush
the statesman bush his first invasion of
kuwait than iraq he says much more
humanitarian than earlier wars
was it
i mean
american army
sank to the
level as
the
the iraqi army of course was totally
overwhelmed by u.s force
as they were repeating
retreating from
kuwait
the peasant
conscripts poor conscripts
shiite kurdish conscripts who were
conscripted by sodom to fight the war
were trying to flee
but the american army was using
bulldozers
to shovel them into
dishes into ditches to suffocate them so
they couldn't flee
and then
well george bush was rating about how
what we say goes
his
air force was destroying
completely undefended infrastructure
throughout iraq
okay
this was incidentally a war also which
never had to be fought
there were plenty of options for
diplomatic settlement
press refused to report them
the u.s government just dismissed them
i could tell you more details about this
if there were time
but uh
could have
been a war that was avoided in fact
though this will outrage millions of
people
the iraqi invasion of kuwait was not all
that different from the u.s invasion of
panama a couple of months earlier
could go into the details i've written
about i wrote about at the time i won't
review it uh
gone gone from history nothing you know
how about bringing it back to history
not
the way the new york times is now
running articles about what they knew 20
years ago
at the time
okay at the time they knew
that for example that
the leading figures in the
anti-television resist afghan resistance
we're denouncing the invasion
because the eu once wants to show its
muscle
and scare everyone and doesn't care
about the afghans
they knew it
did you see it at the time
no
people who mentioned it were simply
ridiculed and denounced
unpatriotic not good red-blooded
americans who line up to
crush everyone by force because that's
our media
nothing changed going back to the first
question
nothing's changed
same institutions
same doctrines
same beliefs
of course the world is somewhat
different
one difference is the population
there's something that
samuel moyne
didn't understand probably doesn't
understand and didn't mention in his
column this morning
he said there is a
there is actually an effect
of more humanitarian wars
it's not coming from the professors and
the academics who he referred to
who somehow are writing articles saying
we should be more humane it's not coming
from them
it's coming from people like you
it's coming from people on the ground
country has become more civilized as a
result of the activism of the 60s
the aftermath
plenty of evidence from that
doesn't get discussed it's not the right
story
so for example take
take the central american wars
there wasn't a stun of the horrible
atrocities hundreds of thousands of
people killed
torture
massacre everything you can think of
but it was
there were things the us couldn't do
it could not do what john f kennedy
could do in south vietnam 20 years
earlier they tried but they couldn't do
it too much opposition here
reagan in fact when he came into office
tried to duplicate what kennedy had done
in 20 years earlier it was an immediate
backlash from the population
we're not accepting that anymore
in fact what happened in central america
was something totally new in the entire
history of imperialism
can't get reported but it was very
significant it's the first time ever
that people in the aggressor country
didn't just protest but went to live
with the victims
i went to live with the victims to try
to help them
try to give
whatever assistance a white face might
do
help them in projects
people from
middle america evangelical churches
all sorts of like visited
churches in rural america where they
knew more about central america than the
academics because they were working
there
and
it's never happened
nobody in france went to live in an
algerian village
nobody in the united states went to live
in a vietnamese village i mean unheard
of
well that happened in central america
and that's the kind of thing that has
changed what the u.s government can do
not articles by academics and
professional journals
but what's happening what's been
happening in activism on the ground
and that can make a difference now too
that's what changes the world
so that actually leads really well into
a question i wanted to ask you which is
that of course you've been active in
anti-war movements since the vietnam war
uh and when i think back on the anti-war
movement that sprang up uh after
afghanistan and particularly in the
lead-up to the iraq war um i should
admit i myself was a young if not
entirely effective or strategic
protester during that time period and
looking back on it it you know if if we
look at the anti-war movement at that
time and ask did it stop the war or even
slow the war or the two wars the answer
of course is no but i'm wondering if you
you know
if if you think that there's something
we can take away from the anti-war
movement of that time period or what you
think future anti-war movements can
learn from
the the time period leading up to
afghanistan and iraq
first thing they should learn is how
effective they were
the common view is we failed
you look at the plans
they weren't carried out
we've just learned a couple of days ago
from
german high-level german sources that
the bush administration was apparently
planning the use of nuclear weapons in
afghanistan
they couldn't do that
u.s population wouldn't tolerate it
the
they were major
the iraq war also had something new in
the history of imperialism
there were massive protests which you
participated in
before the war was officially launched
in fact the war had been going on for a
long time
back to clinton had been bombing iraq
but the if war was officially launched
in march
uh
2003
the
day before i was i remember my own
classes at mit
the students in the class demanded
that the class be cancelled so that we
could all participate
in the
mass demonstrations before
the war was officially declared
it's never happened in the history of
imperialism that was all over the place
well what happened in iraq was bad
enough could have been a lot worse
if the government was if rumsfeld cheney
the rest of them were unleashed
we don't know what would have happened
but they were constrained
by public opposition on the ground
that's happened over and over we haven't
doesn't get written about it's the wrong
story but it's the story we should
recognize so i don't think the anti-war
movement was ineffective and it was very
effective
it's
what
to go back to samuel moyne this morning
it's the real
factor that led to the
very limited reduction in violence
and
terror and destruction that we see
and
the lesson is
continue it harder
take
take the threat of nuclear weapons it's
a very serious threat
mounting
mounted significantly under trump
biden so far at least is pursuing the
same policies
well let's look back
uh early 1980s
there were huge public demonstrations
probably
the biggest in american history
condemning
the emplacement of
short-term
short-distance uh
uh
missiles in
western germany
reach uh
moscow with a 10-minute flight time
greatly increasing the threat of war
perfectly missiles similar protests in
europe enormous protests
well that had an effect
it led
reagan to accept
gorbachev's
offers for
a reduction of for elimination of
energy
for establishing the inf treaty
intermediate range missiles
that
was an enormous step
uh towards peace it reduced
significantly
threats that could have easily led to
nuclear war
well trump
dismantled the treaty
part of his general wrecking ball
destroying everything that has anything
of value
destroyed the inf treaty most of the
rest of the arms control regime
and immediately
this was i think august
2019
picked the anniversary of hiroshima day
to announce it
eliminate the inf treaty
and immediately immediately
launch missiles
which violate the treaty
saying to the russians come on boys join
us we can have fun
and create new more destructive missiles
which will destroy everything it'll
really be fun you know
uh well
that it's the
it's the demonstrations of the early 80s
that put some kind of limit on this
that's lessons too
they can take place now
stop the race to disaster that's going
on there
same with
climate destruction
pressure from the population
young people mostly
has
pressure biden
to put on paper
programs that are not too bad not enough
but much better than anything that
appeared before
on paper
okay
now take a look at what happens
last week
the ipcc
released its latest report
very grim report much worse than
anything before
didn't get
anywhere near adequate coverage here but
it was very serious that was on monday
and what happened on tuesday
on tuesday
biden
issued an appeal to opec
the oil cartel
to increase
production of oil
because he wants gas prices to decline
in the united states
to improve his electoral prospects
so that's what happened on monday and
tuesday
so
nice things on paper
but there are things that happen in the
world
well that's why activism the ground
makes a difference
sunrise movement activists
took over nancy pelosi's office
got support from
alexandria ocasio-cortez so they didn't
just get thrown out
that led to
an actual resolution in congress it's on
the floor
ocasio-cortez and ed markey of
massachusetts have a resolution
which has a very sensible program
which would
deal effectively
with the
severe threat of
global destruction through environmental
destruction
so it's a resolution
but you have to get beyond a resolution
to a legislation
that's going to take a lot of work
republicans of course will be a hundred
percent opposed
their commitment at this point is
slavishly serve
the corporate sector
and
shine trump's boots so that the crowds
he's organized don't go after you
that's the republican party it doesn't
matter what happens the country of the
world 100 no deviation
then there's a couple of democrats who
can block anything
we know it we know who they are well
that means work
um yeah i think it's really interesting
what you said about
the shift in strategy initially because
of the pressure of the anti-war movement
because i grew up in a town where
there were signs um spray-painted signs
that said nuke the towel heads after 9
11 really
brutal brutal
desire for violence
and
i remember a shift happening in the
rhetoric that went from kind of
like blatant bloodlust to
we're being smarter with how we fight
the war and that was a way to kind of
introduce drones as a humanitarian
weapon
but it was also a response to pressure
from the anti-war movement that said
we're not going to sit back and watch
civilian casualties in silence we're not
going to triumphantly march blindly into
another war
um and and so i think that there's a way
in which the victories of the left get
swallowed up
and
rehashed as an idea that came from the
center or came from the right like
no we are being humanitarian we're doing
targeted drone strikes now and that's
better for us citizens who get to play
video games that actually kill people
and it's better for afghanis who
you know better not go to the wrong
wedding venue essentially so i think
that it's um imperative that we take a
a real inventory of our failures and of
our victories and not allow them to get
reworked by the dominant media narrative
and
as um we go into
another two decades of intense change i
think we've obviously seen um the
flooding across the eastern part of the
united states and and the southeast with
hurricane ida the casualties from that
it's bringing the truth of climate
change home we're seeing a proliferation
in nuclear weapons in the united states
that like you said has been
vastly underreported it's staggering
they're faster swifter smaller
um
i
wanted to talk to you about the ways in
which we can talk about left foreign
policy what is left foreign policy how
do we advocate for left foreign policy
how do we keep clear-headed when we're
being
[Music]
plied with
rosy promises from bad actors
well
you publish articles in
jacobin
and you organize people to act on what
they learn
there's no secrets
we know how to do it
the thing is to do it it's been done
over and over
uh every
popular move every
major cause that's been won over the
centuries
has been won by
people who are
working on the ground
take say the civil rights movement
mention the civil rights movement
the name that comes to mind is martin
luther king
who was a great figure he deserves it
but i'm sure he would have been the
first to say
that he was riding on a wave that was
created by people who nobody whose names
nobody knows
snake activists who were riding freedom
buses
through alabama
facing
threats
killing and so on trying to encourage a
black farmer to have the courage to dare
to go to a voting booth
in a bitterly racist country okay
well those are the people who
my old friend howard's inn
put it pretty well once he said that
what matters is the
countless number of unknown people
who lay the basis for the
changes that take place in history he
said it more eloquently but basically
that
i think that's the point
we don't even know the names of the
people
who've
done the really significant and
important work just as we don't know the
names of the people
overseas who are struggling for their
rights courageously under horrible
conditions
okay we can help them in many ways
it's been done in the past can be done
more in the future now we don't have a
lot of time now
the problems are much more urgent than
they were in the past
the climate problem
couple of decades
we don't take care of it in a couple of
decades we'll pass tipping points
face the fact that
the republicans are probably going to
get back into power
probably next year
maybe more in 2024
that means pure denialism
100
denialism
let's race over the precipice as
quickly as possible
because it'll put a little more money in
our court in the pockets of our
corporate masters
that's the republican party
it's going to be a big fight to try to
do something about that
not that democrats are so
magnificent and i've talked about biden
but at least
they can be pressed
okay actually younger republicans can
too
it's not
among younger republicans there's less
of the
cowardly brutal dedication to massive
destruction in the interests of private
wealth
that's
the older part of the republican
leadership the lindsey grahams but
younger people are somewhat different
and they can be reached okay
that can make a difference
well that's the goal thank you you've
played a massive part in that um and we
really owe you a huge debt of gratitude
for everything
and for all of the
unknown
names and opinions that you've brought
into the public eye as well as your own
thank you i just want to quickly mention
for my part uh when i was a teen
anti-war protester
i was living much like ariella in a very
conservative state and somehow a friend
and i managed to get a copy of two books
one was howardson's terrorism and war
and the other was of course your
collection of interviews 911 so i did
not think that i would get a chance to
thank you in person or just over zoom
but thanks very much i mean those two
books were um really foundational i
think
thank you yeah they were
honored with being contraband where i
went to hell right exactly i don't think
i'm
allowed to take them in which helps you
a lot
one of my achievements has been to have
my books banned from one
