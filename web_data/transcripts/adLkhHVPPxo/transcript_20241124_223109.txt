so noam chomsky um gave an interview
recently on a radio show and uh he was
asked about how biden is doing and i
want to show you his comments this is
interesting to me he says
i must say that what biden has done so
far is a rather pleasant
surprise to me chomsky told
barsamian it's better than i would have
expected he's pretty sharply criticized
on the left
for flaws and omissions in the domestic
policy
these criticisms are in my view correct
but a little bit unfair
there's only so much you can do when
half of the senate is no matter what you
say
is going to be 100 percent against it
so um i largely disagree with this and
and i'll break it down for you there is
a grain of truth in what he's saying
the grain of truth is
i think it's a fair assessment to say
biden has gone bigger than you could
have predicted
going into his presidency because going
into his presidency
you could have thought he would have
gone full
obama style and it is true that he
hasn't gone full obama style
he has gone a little bit more bold and a
little bit bigger than obama
i do think that's fair to say but that's
where the credit really ends in my
opinion
um because chomsky's giving him a little
bit
too much leeway he says oh um
the senate is the problem the senate's
blocking it well
they have the ability to either get rid
of the filibuster
or to turn it into the talking
filibuster
and they haven't turned it into the
talking filibuster and they haven't
eliminated the filibuster
so you can't hide behind oh my god the
senate
is the problem when you have the tools
to circumvent it
now the tool that they've decided to use
to circumvent it to this point
is reconciliation which is good but
again you can even expand the
reconciliation rules where instead of
getting like two or three cracks in it a
year
you can give yourself more cracks at it
so
basically they've done like in some ways
the bare minimum in the procedural
arena so for him to say well if the
senate is going to be against it what
are you going to do
that's just not really an accurate
criticism because there are ways around
it and these are ways that biden
has not exhausted so you have to ask
your question the question why hasn't he
exhausted it
now this is where you get into he's one
of the he's old school corporate
centrist and he feels like oh i'll cut
deals with republicans but they've shown
time and time again
we ain't going to work with you dude
especially not on any sort of left-wing
priorities if mitch mcconnell's agreeing
to whatever you want to do
you're probably proposing something
terrible like wall street deregulation
um so i don't really agree with chomsky
the other thing is
there are things that biden can do
himself
right now without the senate that would
be phenomenal for the country
and he hasn't done them so for example
biden has the ability to eliminate
all student loan debt he hasn't done it
now you might say well kyle come on
that's a bernie sanders
pipe dream that only like bernie would
do that biden said he won't do that so
how could you criticize him by that
standard
well okay i don't accept that criticism
but even if i did
he hasn't eliminated 50 000 of student
debt for everybody which he has the
ability to do which was in the
conversation
he hasn't done that he eliminated like
less than one percent
of the student loan debt and it was only
for the people who went to like literal
scam for-profit colleges less than one
percent of student loan debt did he get
rid of
so you can't say oh i've been pleasantly
surprised
um and then act like by the senate's
against it it's the senate's fault
when there are things biden can do on
his own and he hasn't done him here's
another example
legalize marijuana or at least
decriminalize it by taking it
off of the list of schedule 1 substances
he could do that right now if he wanted
to
he hasn't done it he hasn't done it
because he doesn't believe in it
and he doesn't deserve credit when he
can do something that would
substantively
you know help so many people
like that he hasn't done it that you
can't praise him
when he has the ability to do a
tremendous amount of good with one
little thing and he refuses to do it
think of all he was a drug warrior if
anything he should feel terrible
all these people locked up their lives
destroyed over non-violent drug offenses
joe biden helped build that system
and his son hunter is an addict he has
nothing but unending sympathy and love
for hunter
and rehab for hunter but he wants to
lock up everybody else is kid he wants
to lock up black and brown kids
for doing the same thing or not even as
much as hunter has done
and i'm gonna give him credit or blame
the senate no this is on him
gnome and he hasn't done it but i
haven't even given the biggest thing yet
i mean these things are big right
student loan it hasn't eliminated
student loan debt hasn't even eliminated
50
000 of student loan debt hasn't
decriminalized marijuana taking it off
the schedule one list hasn't done any of
that
he hasn't done he hasn't pulled out of
iraq he hasn't pulled out of afghanistan
he hasn't done anything on foreign
policy he didn't even get back in the
iran deal
which is a deal that the administration
that he was a part of
they negotiated it he campaigned on
getting right back in it he didn't do it
you know the public option now granted
he would need the senate for this one
but he can't pay on the public option he
immediately backed off of it and said uh
we'll just
you know subsidize the health insurance
companies which is a giant ruse in a
racket it's a scam
to give more money to his donors so no
you can't
like listen man i get it i'm not i'm not
on the side of
doing a full false equivalence between
the democrats and the republicans or joe
biden versus donald trump
i genuinely believe that the people on
the left who act like they're exactly
the same
that's not substantive you're incorrect
and it's incredibly sloppy thinking
there's a massive difference between the
kind of
package the kind of coveted relief
package that the democrats put together
versus one that the republicans put
together there's
there is there's a giant difference
there's a giant difference
um in a number of areas in a number of
arenas when it comes to the democrats
versus the republicans look at the tax
plan look at biden's tax plan
he wants a higher corporate tax rate
that's better than a lower corporate tax
rate
granted he split the difference it was
in the middle but middle is better than
really low you know he the top marginal
tax rate he wants it at 39
under trump it was what now it was
dropped to what 30
something like that so there is a
difference there so in other words i
don't
agree with people who do the full false
equivalence and act like their parties
are exactly the same and biden's exactly
the same as trump that's just not true
it's not true but however having said
that
i think noam chomsky's gone too far in
the other direction acting like there's
way bigger of a difference than there
really is
and blaming it all in the senate you
can't blame it all in the senate you
just can't
if joe biden wanted that 15 minimum wage
in the covered relief package he could
have gotten it but he had to fight for
it
but he didn't fight for it because he
doesn't really want it you know
same with the 2 000 checks instead of
1400 now granted
1400 is more than trump shitty 600 right
now he pretended like he wanted to
didn't really fight for it in the way
that he was pretending to right
so 1400 better than 600 but he said
campaigned on 2000 he didn't do thousand
he could have gotten it in there if he
wanted to
but he didn't because he didn't fight
for it so you can't
you can't have a politician do the bare
minimum
then not really fight and then give him
credit and blame
the senate for all of his failures
if biden was giving his all and was
still coming up short i would point that
out for people
but he's not giving his all he's not
doing the carrot and stick approach
trying to get mansion and cinema to fall
in line
he's not crusading for the issues that i
care about many lefties care about
again he hasn't done any of the
procedural stuff which he could do right
now
which would drastically improve the
likelihood of him getting stuff through
um so i don't know this is just too much
credit
this is just too much credit i don't
think the criticism there are some
criticisms of buying that are unfair i
think i just laid them out the ones that
say he's exactly like trump in every way
i just don't think that's true i don't
think that's accurate
um but i think noam chomsky's giving him
a little bit too much credit and pawning
off a lot of the failures to the senate
when it has nothing to do with the
senate
you know definitely his failure on
student loan debt has nothing to do with
the senate his failure on the drug war
has nothing at all to do with the senate
his failure on foreign policy has
nothing to do with the senate he's
already bombed syria he's been in office
for seven and a half minutes he's
already bombed syria
i mean come on what are we doing here
what are we doing why are we
continuing the same policy with
venezuela considering us continuing the
same policy with iran what are we doing
and nomishomski knows this he cares the
most about foreign policy so i don't
know
i don't know why he's saying this i
think it's too soft and too kind on
biden
um so you know one of the things that
has
really been concerning to me is that the
left has gotten
so beat down for so long that even very
critical thinkers and independent
thinkers over time
have sort of accepted the shifting right
of the overton window
and the spectrum of debate and um
that's that's sad you know
because then i think this is why fewer
and fewer people get involved in
politics
is because they see like the little
crumbs you're getting and now
you have really independent thinkers who
are sort of celebrating the tiny crumbs
we're getting
and it's like that's just gross
and that turns off a lot of people
instead of having real conversations
about real solutions and trying
everything we can to get them and
you know shooting for the stars we're
accepting the half measure of the half
measure and now
lying to ourselves and acting like well
it's good because it's the left flank of
the spectrum that we're allowed to
debate in well the left flank of the
spectrum that we're allowed to debate in
is like
center-right is like very pro-corporate
very sad neo-liberal war
hawkish it's just it's a sad thing to
see so anyway stay true to your beliefs
and your principles and fight for them
and you don't have to lower the bar
because it's fashionable lower the bar
because other people want you to and uh
you know i'm not saying noam chomsky
doesn't really believe this stuff i
think he does i just think that perhaps
chomsky of a previous generation would
be a little harsher than he's being here
