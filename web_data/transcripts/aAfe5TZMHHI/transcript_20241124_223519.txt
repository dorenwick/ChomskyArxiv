okay switching into another area
international relations what does
colonialism mean well like any term of
about human affairs it covers a vast
range there's all kinds of colonialism I
mean that the worst kind of colonialism
is what's called settler colonialism
like the United States or Australia or
Israel down to lesser extent a settler
colonialism like the United States and
Australia means you exterminate the
indigenous population maybe not a
hundred percent but you know pretty
close so that's the worst kind of
colonialism that's us
there's other kinds of colonialism which
are less extreme so take what we were
talking before about Wilson and Haiti
and Clinton and Haiti there's a form of
colonialism in which you effectively
take over the country for your own
benefit get as much as you can out of it
drive the population and to destroy the
agricultural system drive the population
in the cities all for the most benign
reasons you know great economic
progressive reasons and you end up with
say the
the earthquake that just happened that's
another kind of colonialism other kinds
are there's many other kinds so you know
say take take leave us in the
Philippines which happened to be an
innovation in imperial history the u.s.
invaded the Philippines in the ninth
century ago it killed a couple hundred
thousand people it was vicious racism I
mean these guys unbelievable racism they
weren't even people here weren't even
sure whether the Filipinos were humans
or the Apes
they were exhibited in international
fairs and that sort of me I was just
over in this when you look back at it of
course all for the most noble reasons
were uplifting them Christianizing them
you know giving them civilization the
usual stuff there were scattered
opponents people like not unknown people
like Mark Twain he wrote very sardonic
and cutting anti-imperialist essays now
he wasn't hanged he didn't have his
brains blown out but they were
suppressed they in fact I think they
finally came out around 20 years ago and
some scholarly edition that I would ever
read Syracuse University Press no but
they were there it was nany and peerless
League but it just I don't know what
happened after you conquered it that was
the innovation it has just been studied
in a really Magisterial book great book
by Alfred McCoy who's the story in the
Philippines among other achievements
he's the first person to have studied in
detail how they dealt dealt with the
population after they more or less still
haven't totally conquered them still
going on but pretty much sort of
pacified the country well it turns out
there was a major innovation in imperial
history which had a lot of consequences
right till today in the philippines and
everywhere else what was instituted was
a very sophisticated high-tech control
and surveillance system now the
technology of then was not the
technology of now but it existed
Telegraph radio other surveillance
techniques every technique was used that
was available to try to control monitor
subdue the population there were also
pretty sophisticated techniques of
undermining resistance that were used so
co-optation of elites spreading rumors
you know using every device you had to
try to undermine the nationalists and
the it was done very well and of course
there's a melt fist and the background
is the Philippine Constabulary the
something happens every in colonial
Imperial system you have a you know kind
of a power military force of
collaborators which do what you tell
them and they usually trained killers so
and you can set it up so let's say you
pick people from one tribe to kill
another tribe or you know use the rural
population to smash that urban
population is done in various ways fact
we do it right now this minute that's
the way the u.s. is hoping to run the
occupied Palestinian territories is a US
Army US or an army that's supposed to
subdue them and it's highly praised by
Obama and Kerry and the Liberals and so
on so anyway this array of techniques
was worked out with it quite impressive
detail and applied in a very
sophisticated fashion it still applies
Philippines is still pretty much under
this system the Philippines which
remains a kind of a quasi colony is the
only part of East and Southeast Asia
that has not been part of the so-called
economic miracle you know take a look at
Taiwan South Korea you know even
Indonesia and so on has been a lot of
economic development not the Philippines
they're pretty much under this system
that's the one part of the region that
we still run and it there was an
immediate blowback Wilson and the
British during the first world war use a
lot of these techniques domestically
consciously that could apply at home too
now it's extreme so you go to Britain
that's a surveillance society cameras on
every street corner you know
allegedly Eddie terror devices I mean
here to Patriot Act is so this is very
these are doing this and the u.s.
applied them in other countries right
away so Haiti the maker public you know
arrived with it well that's another kind
of colonialism and very it makes a lot
more sense than occupying the country it
works much better it's cheaper it can
work very effectively in the Philippines
it's a hundred years and it applies back
it develops techniques to apply back
home for controlling and subduing
populations and breaking them up and so
on well that's another kind of
colonialism and a meant to get back to
your question there's no answer to what
is colonialism it's just one form in
which powerful systems subdue others and
they subdue their own population there's
nothing new about that and I was pointed
out by Adam Smith like you know not a
fool I mean what he pointed out and what
the international affairs specialist
don't seem to understand is that you
want to understand how a country works
you cannot ignore the domestic
distribution of power he said just
pointed out in the wealth of nations you
want to understand England which is his
concern you have to recognize that the
architects of policy are merchants and
manufacturers and they set policy up so
that their interests are very well dealt
with even though the impact on the
people of England may be Grievous and of
course elsewhere it's even worse we call
the savage injustice of the Europeans as
a horrible oh it's basically a truth of
enduring truth about power systems
gunfire in India cost of there was a
cost to the British Empire by the
population by the populations there and
by the faculties of India more medical
and the pockets of England we're also
kind of colonizing redistribute the
wealth yeah so it's a class war you know
okay that's
true and it's true for just about every
imperial conquest and as I say the most
extreme for is just extermination like
settler colonialism okay at the other
end of the spectrum in the best sense of
the word what do you think
internationalism means or implies or
constitutes internationalism should be
what you know what has always been at
least the terminology of the left
I mean unions are called internationals
I mean not because they are
internationals but because they ought to
be and their internet their initial
formulaic creation was motivated in part
by the idea that we ought to be
concerned with working people and
peasants and other oppressed people
around the world solidarity
international solidarity was the core
ideology of unions the internationals
that were formed are called
internationals
because that's what they were supposed
to be committed to the world Social
Forum today which is about as close as
there is now gathers I mean if we
weren't so totally caught up in crazed
ideology we'd call the world Social
Forum the one Pro globalization group in
the world and that's it's not Davis
where you get a bunch of rich people
talking about how to enrich yourselves
which is called globalization the world
Social Forum with all of its defects you
know brings together people from all
over the world you know all walks of
life
mutually interacting you know the people
giving and giving seeds to each other
you know supportive ideas about how to
improve the global world for the vast
majority okay that's internationalism so
we should be doing and imperialism as a
form of Internet
when do you think it's right okay for an
individual in the United States to
denounce human rights violations in
another country as compared to when do
you think it's either hypocrisy or
interference now I'm talking an
individual not government either again
it's question of priorities and
priorities I think how much time you
should put into it anyway you know what
is it literally there are you do are
human rights violation somewhere makes
sense to criticism period it makes sense
to criticize them if you can do
something about them if you can't do
anything about them it's just posturing
but if you can help the human rights
activists or press people or whatever
somewhere else
sure you should do it the question is
always priorities time and energy are
finite can't get around that and the
question is how do we compare how do we
decide how to distribute power energies
when there are human rights violations
and they're very clear criteria for that
they are almost a hundred percent
violated but they're extremely clear
what you do which it prioritize is what
any moral human being does the
predictable consequences of your own
actions that's what should be
prioritized I mean somebody else's
actions you can criticize them but
there's no particular moral value to it
unless I can somehow improve things the
one thing you can improve is what you
are doing so overwhelmingly our priority
ought to be our own engagement in human
rights violations which we can change
and incidentally that's kind of
independent of scale even if the ones
we're carrying out or not so terrible
and the ones that somebody else is
carrying out or awful but we can't do
anything about it then elementary
morality says let's focus on ourselves
the practice is almost reverse almost
100% the reverse and furthermore it's
kind of irreversible I mean this great
pleasure taken
in the crimes of others especially if we
can't do anything about if some intimate
sake if it's an enemy if some enemy
commits horrible crimes and we can't do
a thing about it
it's just irresistible to posture
heroically about their crimes for one
thing it's costless because you can't do
anything about it for another thing it
shows that know who you are
another thing is you can align like a
true purring say anything you want and
if anybody says says well man that maybe
that's not quite accurate you can come
back say oh you're a genocide supporter
you know you're in favor of Holocaust so
the whole stream of techniques is
available so just perfect
an intellectuals just love it you know I
think you see it all over the place I
mean there's even a new literary genre
that developed in the last 10 or 15
years which is very highly respected and
that is castigating ourselves for not
criticizing strongly enough the crimes
of others that's that's just marvelous
for one thing you're criticizing
ourselves so look how immoral you are
and you're criticizing ourselves for not
doing enough about the crimes of enemies
which we can't do anything about in fact
if you look at the literature on this
it's it's shot it's astonishing and it's
carried out like almost to a tee it's
like a caricature of itself and the
people are nice people actually I know
some of them you know perfectly nice
people perfectly decent they think we
ought to really sacrifice ourselves you
know castigate ourselves for not doing
enough about the say Pol Pot's genocide
which there was no suggestion about what
to do about but then well totally ignore
everything we're doing totally another
international kind of concept and issue
self-determination what's what does it
mean what sort of right of
self-determination and what under what
circumstances are people to X in title
to exercise the right and conversely
when our people Mountain title tag
like again most things I'm thinking
hazel I don't think you can give a
blanket answer it depends on
circumstances the well you know from
from one point of view everybody has a
right of self-determination I give a
right to control your own life just like
individuals do on the other hand
self-determination is not done in
isolation that has consequences for
others okay so you have to take that
into account then you have to start
balancing things so I take say secession
in the South in the United States sure
the southerners have the right of
self-determination well who was asking
for self-determination white Southerners
not black slaves so it wasn't that the
South was asking for self-determination
on the contrary
large part of the population which
didn't have a voice was opposed to
self-determination for the white masters
there are some other questions and the
same is true in every other place I mean
I think there's you know you pick the
case that you find a complexity of
considerations and you have to kind of
work your way through them but I do not
see how they're going to be formulas
about this because self-determination
while a value is only one of many values
and as in human affairs generally values
often conflict' do you have views about
international structures new
international structures that might
better protect the weak poor people are
subject to violations starving imposed
upon etcetera actual institutional
structures that could you know
interesting but I'm pretty much in the
mainstream of American public opinion on
this totally different from a lead
opinion or anything that's articulate
but if you look at American public
opinion which I've I've written about it
you kind of reviewed the polls and
they're pretty standard and consistent
but nobody really doubts them
considerable majority the public quite a
large majority think that the United
Nations not the United States ought to
take the lead on international crisis
majority of the population think we
ought to give up the veto at the
Security Council everybody ought to and
just follow the will of the majority and
if we don't like it and you know it
continues like this like say I haven't
seen a poll recently after the huge
propaganda offensives of the last couple
years but two years ago you know before
the huge propaganda offences about
forget the exact number but a
considerable jar takes a year on the big
issue considerable majority the
population agreed with almost the entire
world that Iran has the right to enrich
uranium as does any signer than on
proliferation treaty I mean what we read
here is Iran is defying the world by
some interesting definition of the world
the world means not just us the
government means the US government
whoever happens to agree with it that's
the world it excludes the purge majority
of the population of the United States
that includes the non-aligned countries
which is most of the world they really
support it and so on but you know I
think they were right large much I'm
still talking about polls two years ago
now it could be different a large
majority opposed threats of force
against Iran that is they oppose the
United States being a rogue outlaw state
which violates the UN Charter UN Charter
though we'll mention it bars the threat
of force in international affairs
meaning everybody in the American
political system is a criminal because
across the board it's all options have
to be open well the population opposed
the a very large part of the population
I was around 80 percent I thought the
United States should live up to its
legal obligation legal determined by the
World Court to observe the
non-proliferation treaty meaning make
good-faith efforts to eliminate nuclear
weapons that's last time I saw 80
percent the most interesting vote in
this connection just keeping to the top
issue in international affairs is a huge
percentage again
the numbers but it was quite large I
thought that we should establish a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East now that's that's the right answer
to the problems such as they are that
are arising technically the United
States says yes sure but of course
nothing being done about the nuclear
weapons-free zone it's a very
interesting concept if you're really
interested in non-proliferation like
Obama claims he is the one thing you'd
support is nuclear weapons free zones
those are their small steps but steps
towards reducing the threat of nuclear
weapons and proliferation and the facts
are extremely revealing run through some
of them with regard to the Middle East
is overwhelming popular support around
the whole world the United States and
Britain of course what that would mean
is no nuclear weapons in Iran or Israel
or US forces deployed there that would
be a nuclear weapons free zone it's why
it's not even on the agenda except for
the population well it would be an
important step it's feasible
you know inspection procedures of course
and so on but it's technically feasible
and it would mitigate perhaps eliminate
whatever dangers there are but it's not
on the agenda also not mentionable is
that the US and Britain have a very
strong commitment to this very strong
commitment the reason is because of
something that is unutterable when the
US and Britain went to war with Iraq
they tried to provide a very thin legal
cover for it and what they appeal to is
a Security Council resolution 687 from
1991 which called on Iraq to eliminate
its weapons of mass destruction and the
story was they had done it xuit right to
invade if you read that resolution it
calls for the establishment of a
nuclear-free weapon zone in the Middle
East
so therefore the US and Britain way more
than any other country are committed to
this well you can't talk about it
because of like
it's like you know pornography or
something worse but there's a facts
population supported it could eliminate
problems it's much more interesting than
this there are nuclear free weapon zones
in the world one was just finally
achieved in Africa after a lot of
negotiations it's being blocked by the
United States the reason is that the
African Union all of it regards the
island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean as part of Africa because it's a
part of Mauritius which is part of the
African Union well Britain under us
orders have kicked out the whole
population
some years ago illegally of course in
order to build a big US military base so
Britain didn't accept the African Union
agreement because the master says can't
do it they're very loyal the u.s.
refuses to it accepted so the u.s. is
blocking the African Union nuclear
weapons-free zone because we insist on
keeping a base a military base after
having kicked out the population for
nuked storage of nuclear weapons and
crucially for bombing that's one of the
main bases for carrying out aggression
in Central Asia and the Middle East any
bomb Iraq comes from there in fact just
a couple of weeks ago the Navy announced
that they're sending a big submarine
tender to Diego Garcia to service
nuclear submarines and so on and so
forth so we're blocking the African
Union nuclear weapons-free zone
we're refusing to even talk about the
Middle East one which is critical and
it's more is more there's a South
Pacific there is always more there's a
South Pacific nuclear weapons-free zone
which finally it was held up for a long
time by the French because they wanted
to use the French islands for nuclear
weapons testing all right they finally
did their nuclear weapons testing now
it's being held up by the United States
because the Pacific Islands like Palau
and so on they're used for nuclear
on storage and for nuclear submarines so
okay we're blocking the South Pacific
zone meanwhile Obama is giving you know
highly praised speeches about how awful
the clear weapons are we got to do
something about it and there's massive
at least pretended concern maybe actual
concern about the possibility that maybe
Iran's developing nuclear weapons we all
know if anybody from Mars was watching
this they'd be amazed that the species
can even go on you know how can you do
all this without collapsing and ridicule
about yourself well it's easy in a
well-disciplined society
I was thinking roughly the same variant
on what you concluded with thinking you
know a novelist there's no such thing as
a novelist who is cynical enough and
creative enough to come up with a
scenario that even remotely approximates
the reality for I mean the interesting
thing to me is that you know there are
novelists try to do it like say Hill her
you know Vonnegut and they're read and
people laugh if they don't realize that
you know it says actually I saw this
when one of Michael Moore's
documentaries and we never went to the
movies but we did go to one of his duck
I think was the one about John Columbine
I guess Carol my wife and I went to but
we decided to go see it in a
lower-middle-class town just to see what
the audience reaction will be like
because they're the people he's making
fun of they were laughing and I thought
it was great
making fun of all these guys with guns
and so on I probably all have guns they
thought it was you know really funny
well done but I don't think anybody
perceives the reaction to it is a movie
out now called avatar it's the biggest
movie going I don't see how it's
possible for human being to look at that
and not realize that the thing that's
being presented is based on Indochina
and is I mean yeah it is it's just clear
and they even took they even took some
film footage and altered it but you can
if you've seen it all you can see it and
it's you know so it's this horrendous
critique
Imperial kind of attitudes and
everything else the audience absolutely
loves it and don't realize it's about
Iraq also I mean it's just clear and
you're younger than I am but when I was
growing up you know radical kid you know
write about anarchism this and that we
were playing cowboys and Indians yeah
and we were killing the Indians yeah I
mean I sort of knew in some corner of my
mind some well maybe this isn't totally
perfect okay so like the other question
that I asked earlier are questions that
I asked earlier the mistakes that you
think anti-war movement has made over
the years and things that maybe we
should have done differently and
different approaches that we make make
in the future clearly we have had some
successes even some significant
successes but on the other hand we've
also failed in some sense so what what
do you think we've done that we did that
wasn't so wise and things that we should
have been doing thank you a lot of
things that could have been done a lot
better for one thing sectors of the
anti-war movement you know who they were
very nice people our friends and so on
undertook tactics if you undertaking
some always if you're any kind of an
activist you know you're picking
something you decide to do you have to
make a distinction between two kinds of
tactics you could call them you know
fuel good tactics makes me feel good
about myself and do good tactics does
something for somebody else well you
know the anti-war movement dissolved to
a large extent into feel good tactics
which were harmful the fact that
Vietnamese were aware of it like they
talked to them you know what they liked
was quiet nonviolent demonstrations you
know a group of women standing quietly
somewhere what they didn't like was what
was being done say weathermen these are
tactics that are understandable from the
point of view of the people they were
frustrated they were it
nothing was working okay let's go out
smashing windows or let's go out and
have a fight in a third Avenue bar I'm
sure the people were authentic and so on
well you know these are like just gifts
to the ultra Hawks they help to build up
support for the war it was obvious they
were going to have that effect a lot of
it was that I mean a lot especially as
the movement sort of you know kind of
dissolved into sects and like after 68 a
lot of it was that I saw a lot of was
just self-destructive
the other big error was to stop I mean
by 1975 end of the war around 70% of the
population condemned the war as
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake there kind of unbelievable
figures because nobody ever said that
you know where'd to get it from you know
what did I even mean who knows nobody
checked but did that meant there was a
huge reservoir of possible support for
anti-war activity was it dissolved at
left everybody went away
you started condemning the Khmer Rouge
you're doing some other things
okay so then comes the Central American
massacres and so it goes on there are
other things my god
I have almost nobody nobody agrees with
me about this but my friends on the Left
many of them don't understand my own
view and which goes back to around 1970
that the u.s. won the war the business
world recognized that what you read in
the forest or an Economic Review but the
left is committed to the doctrine that
we won you know we stopped the war that
we had no he's one the people united and
the rest of it that's not what happened
we have a rich documentary record and
it's very instructive we should think
about it and be intellectually honest
about it the u.s. didn't go to war in
order to conquer Vietnam in fact it
didn't care Vietnam dropped off the
planet
it didn't care know it but it went to
where were for good reasons you would
think people in the movement would
understand and you know it was kind of
always pretty clear but we have a rich
documentary record in fact I've had it
since about nineteen since the Pentagon
Papers they went to war for the usual
reasons as a mafia principle which is
the dominant principle in world affairs
the godfather does not accept
disobedience it's dangerous if one
country gets away with disobedience no
matter how tiny it is somebody also get
the idea they'll be disobedient pretty
soon your old system erodes that's
basically that one of the dominant
principles in world affairs and the
Vietnam is case in point they were
afraid that Vietnamese nationalism would
be successful yet a successful economic
development it would like to use
kissinger's terminology would be a virus
that would spread contagion so it spread
to Thailand you know Malaya dhunda
Indonesia and I are in real trouble
Indonesia has real resources pretty soon
maybe ultimately Japan which John dower
Asia historian John they are called the
super Domino Japan would accommodate as
the word that was used to an independent
East and Southeast Asia would become its
technological and military center which
would mean that the United States would
have lost the specific phase in the
first and second world war 1950 they
weren't ready to lose the signal world
war so you got to stop you got a fire
spraying contagion there's a cure
destroy the virus and inoculate the
potential victims was done South Vietnam
was pretty much destroyed by 1965 and
the rest of Indochina not long
afterwards never be a model for
independent development the surrounding
countries were inoculated by vicious
dictatorships the most important was
Indonesia really rich in 1965 came the
Suharto coup greeted with total euphoria
and the United States
killed maybe a million people destroy
the only massive popular organization
opened the country up to the west
no more accommodation you know no more
contagion in fact Majora's Mundi who is
not a total fool and later he was
national security adviser for Kennedy
and Johnson the later years in
retrospect he said you know in rest of
it we should have stopped the war in 65
he was right
Vietnam was already essentially
destroyed no virus
Indonesia the big prize has been oculi
did you got a vicious military
dictatorship our kind of guy as Clinton
:
so you know Japan's safe and I'll be in
our side so what's the point of
destroying the rest of the place is it
waste it's not okay I think fee the
anti-war movement should understand that
because that's a pattern that is
followed over and over again it is a
dominant principle of international
affairs it makes perfect sense it's kind
of interesting it's sometimes ridiculed
like the domino theory who believes that
ha everybody believes it because it's
true other world's mostly run like the
Mafia and if you don't understand that
you're not going to understand the next
thing that happens in the world fact
that's part of the reason for the
incredible antagonism to Iran why Iran I
mean the terrible government there's a
lot of terrible governments like Saudi
Arabia's a lot worse well they were
disobedient not going to let them get
away with it in fact it you know it's
it's even sad to say well they took
hostages I'm willing to go with that
disobedience
Cuba's a striking example I mean for
decades the majority of the population
has been in favor of normalizing
relations with Cuba okay disregarding
the population is normal the business
world is in favor of it
has been for a long time big sectors
energy agribusiness pharmaceuticals not
really powerful sectors but we can't do
it we've got to keep punishing them
because they were disobedient now you're
going to get away with it when you
encounter
which you do an incredibly regular basis
as this discussion reveals the extent of
horror how do you get through all that
and go right back to working on actually
going back to work is one of the cures
of it if you can do if you just if you
can't there's nothing you can think of
doing then it just collapse it maybe
decide to give up or you just go into a
deep depression but if you can keep you
know if you keep working
that's cure there's an advantage there
for you know I mean I mean just time and
access and resources I mean that you're
in a position to feel like when you
write when you speak even if it's not
having a gigantic effect and it's not
transforming everything right away it's
perfectly plausible in fact you'd have
to be a bit delusional to think it was
having no impact there are a lot of
other people who will feel that what
they're going to do is going to have
zero impact and they get crushed
I mean fact the matter is realistically
I know that there's very little impact
but it's for me gives me something to do
gives me something to you know feel that
I'm say doing the right thing if it
reaches some people okay good but it's
the same as truth you know any organizer
you organize local people to in a
community to say get a traffic light
where kids cross the street let's see
that achieves something empowers people
then they go on to the next step that's
very there's a difference between a
person who works in a soup kitchen and
you can clearly see the impacts not
changing the whole world but it's having
a dramatic effect often a bigger effect
than left us out on other people's human
lives and in fact that's a reasonable
question you know why should somebody in
the United States not give their time
and their energy to soup kitchens to
helping the poor to doing something of
that character as compared to trying to
build a movement that's going to change
the whole system it's the case of a soup
kitchen versus organizing the community
to get a traffic light Bo organizing
anti-war
woman some things are the largest gate
well as they stay small case trying to
organize the community to get it traffic
Li now that not only has an advantage
kids can cross the street but it
empowers people it can get them to
understand yeah I can do things it's not
hopeless I can go on well that's I do
work in a soup kitchen is great it
doesn't have that effect agreed
understood but you can see how the
choice between social welfare etc our
work and anti-war work anti-capitalist
work becomes a difficult choice of
people and I think that the left is very
disdainful and too quick to dismiss
people who make a different choice than
they make yeah that's true something I
don't i certainly not disdain people who
work in soup kitchens you know like one
of my daughter's works for Oxfam you
know it's kind of what it is you know
you're trying to set up prep but
instantly the Oxfam projects that you
works for at least they're designed to
be like that getting a traffic light I'm
the idea of the project is not just you
know I'm going to come in and build a
well and you can have it it's to try to
get the communities to get started and
doing something about their own lives
that's hard that's the goal okay over
the years you've obviously been subject
to intense a malicious scream to people
attacking you for all kinds of things
and they tribute views to you that you
don't hold or they spin views that you
do hold in a matter that has absolutely
nothing to do with the way you hold them
and so on you know I get a lot of it
tonight make it home let's do the more
of a song I have a couple hundred
letters and comes all the time people
ask good questions I say you know I read
this and that about you what do you say
and so I say fine I'll look at it
in fact I the attacks are of interest in
a number of respects for one thing
there's sometimes incorrect ones ok so I
learned something it's extremely rare
agency but there are cases we are
sending the wrong way
or maybe mmm steak fine I learned and
then I corrected but you have to ask
yourself am I getting my head blown off
by a elite battalion trained in Fort
Bragg well that's what happens in US
domains is it happening to me yeah okay
so people you know lie and slander and
vilified it's not exactly the worst
thing I can say but I'm not so much
worried about you I'm not trying to deal
with you here I'm dealing with again the
people who read it and are deterred from
relating to ideas because of it you've
been slammed about Cambodia Pol Pot etc
what were your actual views obviously
you can't go through hundreds of pages
but your actual views about Cambodia and
on papad and why do you believe they
elicited the attacks first of all yeah
often quite interested in this I mean I
didn't write anything myself in those
days I was writing with ed herman there
there has been a huge literature trying
to show something wrong with it I mean
it's literally the case that nobody has
found a misplaced comma um there was a
in the stuff you wrote about yeah it was
exactly I mean it must be the best stuff
that's ever written because anything you
write you know gotta be some mistakes I
mean you read the professional journals
the last paragraph of every review of a
scholarly monograph lists the errors
which are always there literally nothing
and the reason was explained quite early
on I mean what we wrote about Cambodia
was carefully checked by some of the
leading specialists in the field and
they went through it you know they
corrected some things you know changed
some other things so first of all it's
very unlikely that it would be mistakes
secondly we didn't claim anything we
claimed almost nothing we'd take any
position on it we just said look here's
the data that's available here's what
comes out of the doctoral system let's
compare them I mean the only way and I
said we don't know what happened maybe
that most effect we said you know maybe
the most extreme inventions will turn
out to be correct
that's not our question our question is
let's compare what went in to what came
out
now the only way you can make a mistake
on that is like a logical error okay we
didn't commit elementary logical errors
so in fact and there were no factual
errors but we just took the data that
was there and this was noticed right
away by one of the leading Cambodia's
story ins David Chandler right away you
know look nothing it is on a stand no
matter what's discovered because what
you're claiming is so limited that no
matter what's discovered later on and
ever exact effect what you say I mean to
the extent that we took a position all
at all which was a little limited we
essentially repeated what US
intelligence was saying and everyone
agreed that they were the most
knowledgeable source so young chances
are there never be errors and there
haven't been now it's very very that
remember there are two volumes that
South End published political economy
human rights on these two volumes almost
entirely what they were concerned with
was exactly this question how does the
data that comes in relate to the
interpretation that comes out okay
almost the entire two volumes are about
us crimes how does the data that we have
about them relate to the what comes out
which turns out to be apologetics and
denial
nobody has ever mentioned any of that in
fact we had two major we did do a little
of each side and we had two major
examples there's a chapter devoted to
Cambodia which we went through a detail
there was a chapter devoted east timor
which we went through in detail it's a
very good comparison at two major
atrocities same time same place both
huge one was in the course of invasion
which is much worse
namely steamer but the main difference
between them was that in one case it was
our responsibility and we could have
stopped it right away in the other case
it was somebody else's atrocity we could
do nothing about it
there wasn't it well things have been a
word about the chapter on each team one
the one that's
we more important first of all it's our
crime it's a huge crime and we can stop
it and therefore it's silenced I'm some
words of apologetics and denial okay but
I put aside the just Stalinist types
mostly it's just avoidance on Cambodia
has been an intense effort to try to
show them something wrong with it
that tells you something what it tells
you is an illustration of what we talked
about before the actual practice of
intellectuals gives you an extremely
good criterion for what should be done
by a person with elementary moral
convictions namely the opposite of what
always is done and here you have a
really dramatic example of it and it's
continues right to the present in fact
just recently happen to answer a couple
of these things and in answering I
pointed these things out and I also
pointed out look if you say you're
concerned about Cambodians okay
glad you're concerned about them how
about being concerned about the new
revelations that were just made which we
talked about before about the scale the
incredible scale of the u.s. attack
which is really incredible which in fact
created the Khmer Rouge which you say
you're upset about
so once say something about that the
answers are interesting not one word
about it it's as if I didn't say it you
know what comes out of how come you're
screaming about the Khmer Rouge you're
not condemning the Khmer Rouge shop in
your policy of genocide okay that's the
reason why that makes sense you know
like if you're you know you caught with
your hand in someone's pocket you don't
change the subject and that's that's the
response but if anyone has a criticism
I'd be glad to hear it I've yet to see
it and I think the reasons are
transparent from things like this and
it's not just these two cases it
generalizes actually hidden and I
together and in fact separately have
gone over many such examples you know
thousands of pages of documentation but
I know also responding to the criticisms
like in manufacturing consent or book
which is ten years after all the cab
stuff we've reviewed it and we reviewed
what actually happened what was known at
the time what had been discovered since
the criticisms the nature of the
criticisms we responded to them effect
zero and nobody can even look at that
either the people you know who are kind
of like right inside the doctor'll
system or the kind of decent people who
you're talking about who want to
understand they wouldn't look at our
responses when didn't know they exist
I'm the only thing anyone knows about
that book is well it's says there's a
conspiracy theory in the press or
something okay you already talked about
the Kennedy for which you get slammed
routinely because you deny that he was
killed by X Y & Z you talked about 9/11
so I want to ask you about that you've
been slammed about the Mideast called an
anti-semite called a self-hating Jew etc
yeah interesting that's why I'm asking
again what are your actual views and
broadly and and why do you think they
elicited the attacks that they do and
what is your impression of the attacks
are quite interesting it actually have a
long history I'll actually go back to
the Bible the phrase self-hating Jew and
comes from the Bible it comes from the
book of kings you know that while the
epitome of evil in the Bible was King
Ahab you know remember that story from
when you were in Hebrew school King Ahab
was the evil King you know terrible King
and so on he at one point he called the
prophet Elijah to him and asked Elijah
why are you a hater of Israel okay what
did he mean he mean that Elijah was
condemning the acts of the evil King on
the King like every totalitarian
identified himself with the culture the
society you know everything so if Elijah
is condemning his crimes Elijah must be
a hater of Israel well that's the origin
of the phrase self-hating Jew okay and
it runs through history
in fact in a modern period it's for
explicit actually ah the heaven who was
Israeli diplomat highly respected
British accent who is the face to the
world considering a leader leading
liberal humanist he wants to read an
article it's been 35 years ago in the
American Jewish press Congress weekly
American Jewish Congress which he
described titled Americans American Jew
is what your task is they said your task
is to show that critics of Zionism they
didn't mean Zion as I mean it critics of
the State of Israel are forth two
categories anti-semites
and neurotic self-hating Jews okay
covers 100% of criticisms great and
that's correct
that's the way to cut out a hundred
percent of criticism if it's from non
juicy anti-semitism if it's Jews they're
neurotic self-hating Jews he actually
mentioned two examples MIDI of course
and I have stone aya stone as a
dedicated Zionist you know I made some
quick but the two of us were self-hating
Jews because we were criticizing things
okay that's all I haven't gave the game
away as king I haven't given the game
away and plenty of people in between
actually there's a kind of counterpart
to that which somehow nobody seems to
notice and that's the concept
anti-american what do you think the
concept anti-american and it's used as a
criticism people such as yourself it's
it comes right it we're back to King
Ahab it's a stance straight to telecare
in concept it was used it's used in
totalitarian states like in the Soviet
Union the harshest criticism against
dissidents was their anti Soviet okay so
as a Sahara was any Soviet because he
can attack the crimes of the Kremlin was
he against the Russian people was
against the Russian culture was
associates and saying the Russian people
are awful and quite the contrary as a
Russian nationalist extreme Russian
national
but they were anti-russian because they
were condemning the crimes of the state
and totalitarian states who identify
themselves or the nature of
totalitarianism with the society the
culture you know the people and so on I
know of only one democratic country more
or less necrotic country which has
adopts this totalitarian concept that's
the United States I suppose that
somebody didn't say Italy it condemns
Berlusconi and they were called anti
Italian if he would collapse and
laughter in the streets
hmm not I have had you know he's
attacking Berlusconi but in us in a
totalitarian culture like Western
intellectual culture if you attack the
holy state you must be Adi American I
don't know of any example other than I
things like King Ahab or the Soviet
Union or say the Brazilian military
dictatorship under the Brazilian
military dictatorship if you criticize
torture your auntie Brazilian now it's a
totalitarian concept what's quite
interesting about the United States and
England and a lot of part of Europe is
that this totalitarian concept is
accepted uncritically with regard to the
United States there are even books by
people you know considered liberal
scholars and Paul Hollander at UMass a
respected scholar called the anti
Americans who are the anti Americans we
run through the list it's people who
criticize government causing okay if
you're a deeply committed to talk terian
so deeply you can't see it yeah that's
India America
