nomes going to speak for about 50
minutes and then while he's speaking
there will be some ushers coming through
with note cards you can write down a
question send it up to the front and at
the end depending on how much time we
have I'll share some of those questions
with him and he'll he'll respond to some
of those audience questions I'm not
going to say a lot about gnome there's a
reason why there are 1800 people here
tonight to see him speak this is a very
interesting moment we're on the eve of
the 50th anniversary of his seminal
essay the responsibility of
intellectuals published in this coming
February with the 50th anniversary of
that and he's gone on to write so many
important works just last week I got an
email from someone who was asking for a
bibliography of gnomes political
writings and I referred him to the
website Chomsky info and there's a
section there where it lists some of
gnomes books and he wrote back he said I
saw that but I didn't think that one
person could have possibly written all
those books so I thought it was a
mistake
but indeed he has written all those
books and contributed in so many other
ways and truly is someone who embodies
more than any other person alive I think
the meaning of solidarity which is
something that we really desperately
need in these times today so please join
me in welcoming professor Noam Chomsky
thank you very much humans have been on
the earth for about 200,000 years and
the generation that's coming of age
today is in a position that's unique
whether uniquely privileged or uniquely
unlucky has yet to be determined but
that it's unique is very clear for the
first time in human history it's
necessary to make a crucial decision
will organized human life continue to
exist on this earth or will it not and
that's not in the indefinite future it's
a near future the significance of this
question can cannot be overemphasized
there are two imminent threats to decent
human survival and there are others that
are lurking not too far behind one of
these threats can be very easily dated
August 6th 1945
that's the date on which we learned that
human intelligence had devised the means
to destroy ourselves
it was never seriously in doubt that the
capacity to destroy would escalate and
that it would diffuse too many hands
sharply raising the threat of self
annihilation in the years that followed
the record of near misses is appalling
sometimes from accident and error a few
shocking cases from recklessness if not
worse and today the threat is growing in
both categories escape from catastrophe
for seventy years is a near miracle and
such miracles cannot be trusted to
perpetuate on that fateful day in 1945
which personally I remember very well
humanity entered into a new era the
nuclear age an era that is unlikely to
last very long either
we will soon bring it to an end or it is
likely to bring us to an end I'm not
going to take the time to run through
the record here but it is indeed
appalling and new information is
constantly being unearthed actually one
of the most serious incidents was in
1983 it turns out they've been a very
close call and very relevant to current
concerns we have just very recently
learned more about it thanks to many
years of efforts by the National
Security Archive to obtain access to
classified documents recently and
succeeded the new revelations have to do
with the nuclear command exercise called
Abel Archer in 1983 in an effort to
probe Russian defenses the Reagan
administration launched operations
simulating an attack on Russia reading
leading right up to a pretend nuclear
attack a simulated launch of nuclear
weapons this happened to be at a moment
of extreme international tension pursing
two missiles with flight time of a few
minutes to Moscow had just been emplaced
in Western Europe and there were other
threat escalations a few years ago when
Russian archives were Declassified it
was learned not to surprisingly that the
Russians had taken this pretty seriously
there has been uncertainty however about
what was understood in Washington and
the new evidence that's just been
released reveals that Washington
recognized right away that Abel Archer
now quoting may have inadvertently
placed our relations with the Soviet
Union on a hair-trigger that was the
judgment of a presidential Advisory
Board on the time at the time meaning
that Washington recognized that we were
at the verge of terminal nuclear war
furthermore we have now learned US
intelligence determined that the
Russians were mobilizing forces quoting
again to an unusual level of alert that
which according to protocol means that
the US should have reacted in kind
leading to disaster turns out that one
Air Force officer and named Leonard
roots decided on his own not to follow
prescribed procedures but to do nothing
perhaps averting terminal war we already
knew that shortly after this Russian
automated systems detected a US nuclear
attack and the officer in charge
stanislav petrov also decided to do
nothing instead of transmitting the
information to a higher level possibly
triggering a massive nuclear strike and
any nuclear strike means termination the
record reveals many such frightening
episodes not to speak of shocking
reckless recklessness and adventurism
which to make it worse is often
applauded in super commentary I'll
return soon to the current growing
threat the second imminent threat is
global warming and the same date the end
of world war two is again of
critical significance for some time as
you probably know that geologists have
recognized that the earth is entering
into a new geological era called the
Anthropocene an era that's defined by
extreme human impact on the environment
there has been disagreement about just
what changes became so extreme as to
signal the onset of this new era and a
few months ago the official working
group on the Anthropocene recommended to
the International geological Congress
that the dawn of the Anthropocene should
be given the same date the end of world
war two so according to their analysis
the Anthropocene and the nuclear age
coincide opposing a dual threat to the
survival of organized human life the
report of the working group on the
Anthropocene discusses the sharp
acceleration of extinction rates of
animals and plants and they weren't
warned that the earth is on course but
to see 75% of species become extinct in
the next few centuries if current trends
continue and they also confirm the
conclusion of other scientists that
climate warming co2 is increasing in the
atmosphere at the fastest rate for 66
million years and furthermore that
fossil fuel use is pushing levels from
280 particles of co2 per million ppm and
before the Industrial Revolution to over
400 ppm last July the record and it's
rising at a rate unprecedented in the
geological record the 400 ppm is a
significant number
comes perilously close to the estimated
level of stability of the huge Antarctic
Ice Sheet which is estimated about 450
ppm and it's understood that the
collapse of the ice sheet would have
catastrophic consequences for sea level
rise these are processes already
underway predominantly in the Arctic
regions regions and the broader picture
is no less ominous and practically every
month breaks new temperature records a
huge droughts are threatening survival
for hundreds of millions of people
there are also factors in some of the
most horrendous conflicts Syria today
Darfur not long ago
again I won't take time to review the
record but it should be deeply alarming
to anyone with eyes open it's widely
recognized that we have entered the
period of the sixth mass extinction the
fifth extinction 66 million years ago is
attributed to a huge asteroid that hit
the earth destroying 75% of the species
on earth ending the age of the dinosaurs
opening the way for the rise of small
mammals ultimately humans about 200,000
years ago and it's taken us only a few
hundred years to bring about the sixth
extinction which is interestingly
different from the earlier ones so
recent studies show in quite instructive
ways in the earlier mass extinctions
body size was not correlated with
extinction but in the human generated
sixth extinction which is now underway
researchers report and now quoting an
extreme bias against large bodied
animals that distinguishes the modern
diversity crisis
from all deep time analogues which means
in short that we're mainly killing
larger animals and that's a record that
goes back to protohumans million years
ago from the beginning predatory species
that cause significant harm to large
organisms now approaching truly lethal
scale and with ourselves not far in the
distance the human capacity to destroy
one another on a massive scale has not
been in doubt for a long time with a
hideous peak in the past century what's
happening now brings to mind a phrase
made famous by Thomas Hobbes man is a
wolf to his fellow man and it also make
brings to mind the bitter rejoinder by
Joseph de Maistre that the comment is
unfair to wolves who only kill for
survival unlike us in thinking about the
risks to survival it's important to
focus attention on the United States
particularly so for for us for American
citizens that one reason is elementary
moral principle it's what we hope to
shape an influence that must be primary
concern which means those policies that
are within reach within our reach
typically policies of our own
institutions state and private so we can
deplore the building of coal plants in
India but we can't do much about it
directly at least but we can do a lot
about building coal plants in the United
States and in fact a very clear choice
about that extremely significant matter
is arising in a few weeks when we have
to choose between a presidential
candidate who's committed to phasing out
this
highly destructive practice and another
candidate who calls for accelerating the
race to destruction and there are other
reasons for focusing on the United
States the reasons that hold for
everyone in the world a very simply us
power and the global system is enormous
without any historical comparison now
that was clearly true in 1945 the date
of the inception of these dual threats
to survival at that time the US had
about 50% of total world wealth other
industrial societies had been devastated
by the war of the US economy again de
normally from the war virtually
quadrupling industrial production
setting the stage for rapid post-war
growth the US had been by far the
richest country in the world for a
century but prior to World War two it
was not the major player in world
affairs and that was a role held
primarily by England secondarily France
of course all of that changed radically
during the Second World War and France
declined sharply as a world power and
the British ruefully recognized that
they could only hope to be a junior
partner in the system of world order
managed in Washington quoting the
British Foreign Office British officials
had ample historical experience of their
own and accordingly they had few
illusions about what was happening and
their descriptions are telling they
recognized in their words and now
quoting high British officials that the
economic imperialism of American
business interests is attempting to
elbow us out under the cloak of a
benevolent and avuncular
nationalism the Americans believe that
the United States stands for something
in the world something of which the
world has need something which the world
is going to like something in the final
analysis which the world is going to
take whether it or not he was
articulating the real-world version of
what scholarship calls
wilsonian idealism the version that
conforms to the historical and the
internal record well naturally this
position of global dominance post-war
position that couldn't be maintained
entirely other industrial countries
reconstructed the decolonization
proceeded on it's often agonizing course
leading to a more diverse international
system but which the United States still
uniquely powerful so by 1970 US share of
global wealth had declined to about 25
percent still colossal but not 50
percent and it remains roughly there
these observations are fairly familiar
but they're also somewhat misleading and
the reason is because of the way that
the globalization of the world economy
has proceeded in the recent decades
particularly revealing in this
connection is quite important work by
Shawn Stars he's the first political
economist to have closely investigated a
very important topic
corporate ownership of the world's
wealth and it's becoming a more
realistic measure of global power than
national wealth in the neoliberal
globalized world of the last few decades
it's no longer a world of nationally
discrete political economies and the
results of investigations are quite
dramatic so it turns out that in
virtually every sector
u.s. corporations are well in the lead
in ownership of the International
economy and overall their ownership is
not far below 50% about what US national
wealth was in 91 good illustration that
he gives is iPhones everyone has one
these are assembled in China by two
Taiwanese firms the major one Donis
Foxconn these two firms are intern
subcontractors for Apple Fox cons profit
in 2014 was 4.3 billion dollars while
Apple's was ten times larger forty four
point five billion and China's share of
the profit was tiny even though it's the
exporter of iPhones it adds very little
value to the product and they're similar
measures across the international
economy multinational corporations are
nationally based they rely on the nation
state ultimately the citizens of the
nation-state for protection and
sustenance in fact for their existence
and in the current globalized world of
u.s. dominance of the global economy is
in important respects not very different
from what it was at the peak historical
peak of 1945 in the military dimension
of course
the United States is entirely without
parallel spins almost as much as the
rest of the world combined it's
technologically far more advanced
military bases all over the world and
military operations of one sort or
another in great many countries no one
else's
even playing that game it's unique for
reasons such as these the importance of
focus on US policies should be quite
clear the military the main
that leads us to the growing threat of
nuclear war it's primarily at the
Russian border there's a secondary
threat off the coasts of China it's
concerning control of the South China
Sea and contested islands and it's
important to bear in mind that the
threats are not at the Mexican border or
off the coasts of California and Florida
now that's again a reflection of global
power at the Russian border the most
dangerous situation both NATO and Russia
are sharply increasing their military
forces and also carrying out highly
adventurist confrontational tactics
which are extremely hazardous so there
are close encounters of military jet
planes sometimes feet apart
NATO military exercises are taking place
within a couple hundred yards of the
Russian border and there are many other
highly provocative acts which can blow
up by accident
meanwhile both sides are expanding their
military Arsenal's on the US side one
significant element as Obama's plan for
a trillion dollar upgrading of the
nuclear weapons system now that includes
new nuclear weapons that are recognized
by strategic analysts to be particularly
dangerous the reason is that they can be
scaled down to tactical battlefield use
that offers temptations at times of
conflict that could quickly escalate to
full-scale nuclear war terminal disaster
also highly provocative is the $800
million 800 million dollar missile
defense system that Washington recently
installed in Romania allegedly in
defense against non-existent Iranian
nuclear
it's recognized on all sides that what's
called missile defense insofar as it
works at all is actually an offensive
weapon it's part of an offensive
military system it could never stop a
serious first strike but it's
conceivable that it might impede a
retaliatory strike which makes it a
first strike weapon of course
hence the Romanian installation is
highly threatening to Russia the threat
of war at the Russian border is in
significant part an outgrowth of NATO
expansion since the collapse of the
Soviet Union twenty-five years ago
that's during the administration of the
first president Bush and his Secretary
of State James Baker and in Russia
Mikhail Gorbachev and what happened at
that time is highly instructive if you
look at it closely Gorbachev and Baker
bush Baker had conflicting VIS visions
of the world order that should arise
with the disappearance of the Soviet
Union so Gorbachev called for
dismantling of all military alliances to
be replaced by a new unified Eurasian
security system which would integrate
the Soviet Union former Soviet Union and
Western Europe Bush and Baker had a
different plan and NATO would expand
while the Soviet system collapsed the
issue was joined right away over the
most crucial question the fate of
Germany the Gorbachev agreed the German
unification even German exception to
NATO which is a pretty remarkable
concession in the light of recent
history but there was a quid pro quo
NATO would not extend one inch to the
east that was the phrase that was used
in the negotiations meaning East Germany
expansion beyond that was not
contemplated Bush and Baker agreed to
this compromise but only verbally it was
a gentlemen's agreement a handshake not
in writing NATO at once expanded to East
Germany but as Bush and Baker correctly
stated they were not violating a written
pledge just a gentlemen's agreement
there's a rich scholarly literature
trying to determine just what happened
in those days and there's a very recent
publication which provides quite a
surprising and instructive resolution to
many of these questions it's an article
by Joshua it's go it's Schiffer Anson in
the prestigious journal international
security a couple of months ago he
carried out an extensive study of
previously ignored archives and it
reveals quite persuasively that the bush
baker verbal commitments to gorbachev
were explicitly designed to mislead that
gorbachev while US dominance extended to
the east and it's quite an important
discovery that was only the first step
under clinton NATO expanded further to
the east in 2008 and again in 2013 this
is under Obama NATO went so far as to
offer membership in NATO to Ukraine
that's the Russian geopolitical
heartland long historical cultural
relationships with Russia a highly
provocative move which had many
consequences George Kennan other senior
statesmen had warned early on that NATO
enlargement would be as they put it a
tragic mistake a policy error of
historic proportions it's now leading to
rising
mentions on the Russian border which is
the traditional invasion route through
which Russia was virtually destroyed
twice in the past century by Germany
alone not just Germany as part of a huge
military alliance led by the most
powerful state in world history the risk
of terminal nuclear war is not slight
reflecting on these matters the European
historian Richard sacra writes
accurately enough that NATO's mission
today is to manage the risks created by
its existence that's worth thinking
about meanwhile NATO's official mission
has been extended well beyond the
official mission to control the global
energy system pipelines and sea lanes
and unofficially to serve as an
intervention force under US command as
we've seen long forgotten and apparently
intended only to mislead or the promises
made by George Bush and James Baker to
Gorbachev that NATO would become a more
political alliance in return for
Gorbachev's agreement to allow German
unification within NATO which again was
a remarkable concession in the light of
history well the fate of NATO since the
end of the Cold War is quite revealing
shines a bright light on the real nature
of the Cold War and its doctrinal basis
so a NATO of course had been presented
and all along as necessary to hold off
the Russian hordes 1991 no more Russian
 so what happened did NATO
disappear
no it expanded in the manner that I
described
that provides no slight insight into
operative policies in the years before
what it reveals just pretty clear had in
fact not passed entirely unnoticed in
mainstream scholarship so a decade
earlier in 1981 Harvard professor
government adviser Samuel Huntington had
observed that in his words you may have
to sell intervention or other military
action in such a way as to create the
misimpression that it is the Soviet
Union you're fighting that's what the
United States has done ever since the
Truman Doctrine in 1947 which is a
pretty accurate description of what
actually happened during the Cold War
and when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989
pursuing the same logic Huntington
warned his words that Gorbachev public
relations can be as much a threat to
American interests in Europe as we're
bridge Neves
tanks and the threat of Gorbachev's
peace offers was overcome in the manner
just reviewed and we're now facing the
consequences the mounting threat of war
particularly on the Russian border has
elicited considerable alarm in national
security circles not discussed much but
in those circles they're watching one
highly respected analyst who said long
experience at the nuclear brink as he
describes it warns that his words we
were facing nuclear dangers today that
are in fact more likely to erupt into a
nuclear conflict than during the Cold
War
that's former defense secretary William
Perry recently and he's far from alone
every year a group of experts organized
by the bulletin of Atomic Scientists to
update the Doomsday Clock that they
established in 1947 at the dawn of the
nuclear age
midnight means terminal disaster and the
question is how close is the and the
midnight that two years ago they moved
the clock to minutes closer to midnight
to three minutes to midnight where it
remains that's the closest it's been to
midnight
since the able Archer war scare of the
early 1980s which was quite severe we
now know and explaining that decision
they invoked the growing threat of
nuclear war thinking particularly of the
Russian border but they also added
something additional for the first time
the failure of governments to seriously
deal with the impending environmental
crisis and in both cases with good
reason well there have been some steps
to addressing the environmental crisis
the Paris agreements of last December
have finally gone into effect officially
the provisions are inadequate but there
are at least something and a basis for
going on it had been hoped that the
negotiations would lead to a verifiable
treaty but that goal was not attained
it's only a voluntary agreement much
weaker of course the reason for this was
clearly understood it was actually
reported in the press
though not prominently enough the reason
was very simple the Republican Congress
would not accept binding commitments so
there is no verifiable treaty only
something much weaker a matter of no
slight importance and
virtually no comment that's an
astonishing fact if you think about it
that a major political organization in
the most powerful country in world
history is literally dedicated to
destruction of much of life on earth now
that might seem to be an unfair comment
but I don't think it is right now we're
in the midst of the quadrennial
electoral frenzy think about the
Republican primaries which recently
ended in the Republican primaries every
single candidate denied the facts about
climate change there was one exception
the guy who was supposed to be the
sensible moderate John Kasich he
conceded the facts but said we should do
nothing about it which is even worse
than denying them that's a hundred
percent the winning candidate that calls
for more use of fossil fuels including
coal plants the most destructive he also
calls for dismantling regulations
refusing funds to developing societies
that are seeking to move the sustainable
energy and in every possible way
accelerating the race to disaster when
you consider the stakes it's a fair
question whether there has ever been a
more dangerous organization in history
than today's Republican party I think
the answer is No
and worse still there is no commentary
on this right through the primary
campaign very little sense that
astonishing blindness as the lemmings
march to the precipice in fact extends
well beyond so in the past few years
there's been extensive and typically
euphoric coverage of the prospects for a
hundred years of energy independence
given new technology for exploiting
fossil fuels occasionally there's
comment on the local impact of fracking
but scarcely a comment if you can even
find one in fact and pointing out that
the euphoria amounts to an enthusiastic
call for the sixth extinction to swallow
us up at well similarly the growing
threat of nuclear disaster barely
elicits a mention of the two most
important questions in human history on
which the fate of the species depends
are virtually missing from the extensive
commentary on choice of leader for the
most powerful country in world history
and we'll see how the matter is treated
in the spectacle that many of us will
endure in a few moments I think you can
predict it's hard to find words to
capture the enormity of this
extraordinary blindness in the case of
nuclear weapons we know how to overcome
the threat abolish them and that's not a
utopian dream it's not advocated just by
the war resisters League and I would
guess many of us here but it's also
advocated by mainstream establishment
figures for example Reagan's
if State George Shultz former Secretary
of
leading specialist on nuclear weapons
for many years Henry Kissinger and
William Perry they are in fact the four
signers of an op-ed in The Wall Street
Journal calling for elimination total
elimination of this scourge another
highly respected nuclear security expert
first Blair has recently formed the new
organization called global zero which
calls for an international treaty to ban
nuclear weapons the International Court
of Justice in its historic advisory
opinion in 1996 on the legality of the
threat or use of nuclear weapons that
came quite close to this stand and
sensible concrete steps have been
proposed to this end which could be
taken right away and surely steps can be
taken to reduce the international
tensions that are provoking the threat
instead of escalating them that the
threat of global warming can be overcome
effectively is less clear though there
are very clear steps that can and must
be taken if this to be any hope for
decent human survival and once again
decisions about these matters are the
most important decisions in human
history and actions to implement these
decisions cannot be delayed
okay okay so before kick-off I think
we've got time for some questions so the
first question now do you believe Edward
Snowden deserves a pardon why or why not
yeah I'm one of the signers of a
petition I think was instantly initiated
by Atmos international the calling for
him to be pardoned I don't think that
goes far enough
he should not just be pardoned he should
be honored and maybe
and maybe Washington should be pardoned
that's up to you but the question
shouldn't arise in the case of Snowden
who simply performed the actions of a
citizen who's concerned about his
country in the world he informed people
the citizens of the United States and
what their government is doing to them
just what a citizen ought to do so he
should be honored and we should be
asking whether the government should be
pardoned okay so next question how
should developed countries respond to
the mass migrations caused by war and
climate change well certainly not the
way they're doing and in fact what's
called the refugee crisis is in fact a
moral crisis in the West I mean there
are there are countries where there are
cases in history of refugee of migrant
crises that are severe in fact we're
living in such a case the migrant crisis
from Europe eliminated or destroyed the
indigenous population that's a pretty
serious crisis that's the extreme case
of migrant crisis today there are
countries that are absorbing huge
numbers of refugees Lebanon poor country
as about 40% immigrant migrants refugees
the Lebanon had nothing to do with
engendering the crisis but it's taking
the consequences Jordan has a huge
number of refugees so does turkey the
United States says practically none
Europe has very limited number very
small compared with it's not only with
its wealth but also with its role in
creating the crises
our role in recent years is even greater
so on the one hand you have rich
powerful countries which have played a
major role in creating the crises and
are now groaning because maybe they'll
have to accept the tiny bit of the
consequences and have poorer countries
which has nothing to do with the crisis
which are absorbing the refugees so
that's a moral crisis it's we have in
the United States the same crisis with
regard to Central America that people
fleeing from Central America are for the
most part fleeing from crimes that we
committed and then we tell Mexico to
send them back and not let them come
near our border pretty much as Europe
does in the case of Turkey this is not
only true of the migrants from East from
Iraq Syria and the Levant region but
also from Africa one effect of the you
the destruction of Libya actually
initiated by France and England with the
u.s. leading from behind as Obama put it
has been not only to destroy Libya but
to and vastly increase the level of
human the human disaster catastrophe
killings in Libya but it also opened the
funnel for people fleeing from Africa
well Europe has a certain relation to
Africa for the past couple of centuries
don't have to review it now Europe again
groaning under the impact of the flight
of people from regions it has devastated
and this is not ancient history it's
recent current history so take the
richest country in Africa potentially
the richest country which could have led
Africa to become the flourishing region
Congo enormous wealth it was a Belgian
colony the treatment of the Congo by the
Belgians was
horrendous even by the standards of
European imperialism which was horrible
enough was one of the worst cases in
1960 the Congo did achieve liberation
they had a political leader young
political leader very promising very
popular Patrice Lumumba what happened
the CIA instantly targeted him for
assassination but they didn't make it
the Belgians have managed to assassinate
him first through proxies and they
didn't take any chances so his body was
cut up in pieces and dissolved in
sulfuric acid that took care of Lumumba
and the Congo hoped for independence
then the United States and its allies
supported a murderous kleptomaniac
Mobutu as long as they could
won't go through the direct what's left
of the country right now the last couple
of years the worst atrocities in the
world are countering out in the Congo in
eastern Congo millions of people have
been slaughtered in the last couple of
years
one reason for it is your cell phones
multinationals are hovering over the
warring militias to get the minerals
that are needed for high-tech equipment
like cell phones in the West
that's the Congo it's not ancient
history that extends over much of the
region so yes there's a migrant crisis
in Europe a moral crisis and one of
extreme danger to the world
I mean I'm old enough to remember what
it means when Austria and Germany have
political parties that are effectively
neo-nazi I can remember Hitler speeches
in 1936 37 and it's not a nice memory
and that's what's happening in reaction
to what's called the refugee crisis we
have our own variant of it which is
and vicious and again of course coming
up in the presidential campaign okay so
no we also have a question now about
Brazil I would like you to comment about
the coup in Brazil
well the what's happened in Brazil is
sometimes described as a coup usually a
soft coup it's not a military coup of
the kind that the US helped initiate and
back in 1964 the basis for it was left
by the was initiated by the Kennedy
administration it was carried out
shortly after the assassination
instituted the first neo-nazi style
national security state in the
hemisphere was later a plague that later
spread through most of the hemisphere
reaching Central America in the 1980s
that was the 1964 coup this one is not a
military coup like that it's a kind of a
quasi parliamentary coup it removed from
office practically the one political
figure who has not been implicated in
the corruption scandal in an effort to
enrich herself it's about the only one
free from those charges the people who
are voting to impeach her succeeded in
voting to impeach her almost all of them
are under severe and significant charges
of major corruption for their own
benefit so it's a soft coup in fact the
Supreme Court of Brazil itself
determined that the official charges
against Dilma Rousseff are not
legitimate charges but that the
impeachment went through nevertheless
the current government the Tama
government is actually I should say much
of my information about this comes from
my wife Valeria's Brazilian tells me
what's happening in the Brazilian
newspapers the
the current government is instituting
extremely reactionary policies clearly
attempting to dismantle the progress and
achievements that were made by under the
PT the Workers Party in the past 15
years now they're guilty of plenty of
crimes they did some pretty awful things
but they did also carry out policies
which were pretty been quite beneficial
to much of the population now being
reversed the new ku government if you
want to call it that is all white all
male and a diverse country and the
policies are pretty frightening of
course strongly supported by the United
States as part of an effort on the part
of the United States to reverse the
progressive developments that have taken
place in Latin America in the past 15
years and the I should say the left
elements in these countries have plenty
to answer for they did a lot of things
which are quite blameworthy totally
wrong but nothing justifies the soft
coup that's taking place ok we have a
question about education higher
education what do you and popular
education what do you recommend for
people who want to study at university
university level but cannot afford it
and do not want to get tangled up in
loans and debt well what they ought to
do I mean there's you know you can't
answer the question for an individual
but we should be answering it
collectively so we should be asking it
for exam why is there why are there
costs for higher education why isn't it
like secondary education and again
that's not a strange question there's
certainly no economic basis for it if
you look around the world today the
richest most successful countries have
free virtually free higher education so
Germany which is the most successful of
the modern state
capitalist societies higher education is
virtually free the Finland which comes
out at the top and almost all
international competitions free and so
on across the board you go to poor
countries just go south of the border to
Mexico poorer country quite a
respectable higher education system in
their thoughts it's very quite
respectable high quality has problems
like very low salaries so the faculty
have to have second jobs but that's
because it's a very poor country
education is free take a look at our own
country in the 1940s and 1950s 50s and
60s the great growth period highest
growth period in American society higher
education was virtually free for a huge
number of people it was not only free
but subsidized namely those
beneficiaries of the GI Bill people have
never would have gone to college were
enabled to do so for good for themselves
very good for the country contributed to
successful economic growth even private
colleges like Ivy League colleges though
they had tuition it was extremely low I
entered the University of Pennsylvania
and Ivy League college in 1945 that
tuition was $100 that would be maybe
$800 by today's real value and you could
easily get a scholarship so it was
essentially free that was a much poorer
country then the US today is far richer
than it was in that period I think if
you think it through they can't really
be an economic reason for this there are
other reasons not good reasons didn't
think what they might be but I think an
answer to the question an individual is
stuck
you gotta that person is stuck with what
exists but as part of a collective
that person is not stuck now they can be
part of an effort to reverse the
programs of the past that the policies
of the past 30 years roughly 30 40 years
and which have led to the situation in
which young people are trapped for life
with debt that they cannot get rid of
notice that the Paul I'm sure you know
this the policies are set up so that you
can't declare bankruptcy like a business
the government can garnish your Social
Security you're trapped for life a
highly disciplinary measure incidentally
and I don't think there's any
justification for it like other things
individually you can't do much about it
collectively you could do quite a lot so
now there's a question about your view
on artificial intelligence and that the
threat or hope that it presents when
anyone asks that question the first
thing that comes to mind is a famous
comment that was made by a great
biologist at MIT Jerry let been in a
debate about artificial intelligence
back around 1960 and at the end of the
debate he conceded that artificial
intelligence was pretty interesting but
he said it was miss named should have
been called natural stupidity but it's a
bit unfair but not totally there's a lot
of hype about our artificial
intelligence and there are some
achievements like say Google Translator
achievement robotics can make some
achievements but it's doing very little
in from a scientific point of view it's
achieving things from a kind of an
engineering point of view which is ok
nobody should be opposed to bigger
bulldozers if they work now but we
shouldn't be mislead about the insight
that it's supposed to be providing into
the nature of intelligence it's not
doing that it's often some other
direction so it's a valuable pursuit
which can be useful
if it does insofar as it is part of
science which it is partially it's just
ordinary cognitive science an effort to
try to find the nature of intelligent
behavior using computer-based models as
a technique of research and it's fine
actually it's pretty close to the kind
of work of all my life myself but the
the you should be pretty cautious about
evaluating the PR that's associated with
it which often pretty often is quite
remote from the actual level of insight
obtained by these measures now there are
also threats of artificial intelligence
serious ones that's particularly true in
the weapon system if the weapon system
becomes automated we're in deep trouble
automated systems fail all the time any
of you who have computers are familiar
with this they cannot be made reliable
and if there unless there are very
narrow controls tight controls they can
blow up actually I gave a couple of
cases when I was talking past cases we
know the u.s. record is fairly open the
Russian record is probably much worse we
don't know but in the u in the case of
the United States there have been
literally hundreds of cases when there
were the autumn the the automated
detection systems that detect an alleged
missile attack just gave the wrong
answer misfire and often we were within
minutes of responding a human
intervention interceded and that's going
to be true pretty generally that's a
serious problem
so using AI and the weapon system is
something extremely dangerous as is the
weapon system itself in other areas the
techniques can often be useful the fear
the idea that say robotics are going to
displace working people and you know
people will be out of jobs with all
these smart machines around there's just
no evidence for that at all I mean if
you look around the country there's a
huge amount of work to be done take a
walk in any city you know they're all
falling apart plenty of things to be
done
education way underfunded research
through vastly more this vast needs all
over the place there are plenty of idle
hands there are resources to use those
idle hands to do the necessary work but
the system is so corrupt that it can't
put them together that's the problem not
the fear that robots are going to
displace us in fact to the extent that
dull boring work can be taken over by
automata that's liberating it frees
people to do more interesting things
including having leisure the United
States has much less leisure than
comparable countries and nothing wrong
with using leisure to enrich your own
lives and whatever way you choose and
there's certainly nothing wrong with
freeing people to do more creative
independent work and let the robots do
the boring and dangerous stuff ok two
more questions is there ever a role for
a benevolent imperialism
it's kind of like asking whether there's
a role for a benevolent slave owner
probably I mean it's better to have a
benevolent slave owner than a slave
owner who's a murderous brutal vicious
thug but the concept is an oxymoron it
just can't happen
what gives you hope people like you
that's the hope of the future the
futures in your hands there's a lot that
can be done despite all the problems of
the country it's actually a much more
civilized country than it was 50 years
ago much more and all kinds of ways the
role of the rights of rights of women
for example all sorts of other things
that's didn't come as a gift came out of
popular struggle often pretty hard but
it left the legacy to us we benefit from
it it kind of gives us a plateau from
which to go on plenty of problems in
fact the worst problems in human history
but they can be addressed and people
like you were in a position to address
them and that's where the hope is
you
