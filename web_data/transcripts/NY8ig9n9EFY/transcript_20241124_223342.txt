Mark thanks good morning everybody rainy
day gnome thanks for joining us you gave
a great talk yesterday now here's a
strange thing you very well known yet I
think you underestimated ated and what
is underestimated is your sense of
humor I'll give you a
quote U the political Spectrum in the
United States always very narrow has
been reduced to near invisibility
yes um here's another one uh American
policies with regard to Brazil in the
1950s I quote we find it hard heart to
induce people to accept our doctrine
that the rich should plunder the poor a
public relations problem that had not
yet been
solved that's not my quote that's John
Foster
Dulles the last the last sentence about
the public relations problem is mine but
his comment tell us was we find the
Communists have an advantage over us we
find it hard too they think that the
poor should plunder the rich that was
his comment and I say we find it hard to
convince people that the rich should
plunder the poor that's it do you think
this public relations issue has now been
solved if it was we wouldn't have uh
Global terrorism campaigns like Obama's
drun
campaign thousand military bases around
the world over government of course not
it's the
same um No Tomorrow there's a party for
the
1% here in the
neighborhood uh we in an era in which
Hollywood
celebrates idiots as culture
Heroes Great Gatsby Wolf Wall
Street is there good news
for the
99% and what kind of news would you be
looking for well the good news is people
like you people are interested in uh
overcoming the uh extreme narrowness of
the spectrum of political discussion
that you talked about the uh enormous
inequities and oppression and the uh
Society the
last night the people who are engaged in
trying to end the uh extremely ominous
threat of nuclear war and environmental
catastrophe that's the good news but
that's always been the good news I mean
class war goes on all a time it's
usually
one-sided uh the business classes are
very dedicated to uh class war they
never relent uh constantly fighting it
and the question is whether they will be
in opposition uh if there isn't of
course they uh move forward and you get
periods like uh the last generation of
vicious class war with no response
that's the general neoliberal assault on
the population around the world and uh
uh you see Rising opposition that's the
good news others are entering into the
class
war the counterpart to the plutocracy
the super rich the 1% is the
precariat working in very precarious
conditions um
including those on part-time contract
short-term contract migrants unemployed
youth seniors without a pension um do
you see
institutional improvements for them on
the horizon
well it's it's certainly true I mean
from the point of view of those
conducting the class war on the part of
the business classes and the government
closely linked to them uh the best thing
would be to have a population which is
living a precarious existence and this
is not a secret incidentally it's very
well understood by those waging the war
so for one of the clearest uh statements
of it was by uh
a man who used to be called St Allen
before 2007 when the system he carefully
constructed crashed totally uh Alan
Greenspan the former head of the
uh
the the Federal Reserve yeah
the when he was testifying before
Congress late 80s at the time when he
was late '90s he was testifying about
the marvels of the terrific economy that
he was running he explained frankly that
it was based on what he called a growing
worker in security Now from the point of
view of economists that's a very healthy
thing because if workers are insecure
they're not going to ask for benefits
they're not going to strike uh they're
not going to call for an increase in
wages and you get a more healthy economy
that is an economy which is geared to
what's called efficiency it's an
ideological not an economic term uh and
concentration of wealth and
concentration of power and
marginalization of the population so yes
growing worker insecurity is very
healthy for the state of the economy but
also for the society in general uh if
you have a global
precariat you say then uh then it's
possible for uh uh uh the other actually
there's another term that corresponds to
precariat which should be brought in
that's
plutonomy uh back around 2005 I think a
City Bank uh produced a a manual for
investors uh good advice for investors
and it describe the way the world scene
is changing it said the world is being
divided into a
plutonomy and everyone else uh everyone
else is the precariat plutonomy is a
small sector uh concentrated in the
United States but plenty of other places
uh so England by now China you know
India so that even the poorest countries
in the world there are people who are
rich to the point of you
know it's beyond extraordinary so there
is a Global plutonomy with of course
heavily
concentrated uh then there's the
precariat who live under conditions of
insecurity like uh say auns in uh
universities who were the temps of the
University system they're very useful
for the for those who run the university
whether it's the legislature or the
trustees or whatever it happens to be if
you have a large number of temps doing
the work very low salaries uh no hope of
advancement uh no possibility or limited
possibility of organizing there is
actually some but not much uh then it's
e they're easy to control and you get a
higher efficiency in the ideological
sense so a world that's divided into
plutonomy and a precariat would be a
kind of a perfect world uh well uh if
the precariat is willing to tolerate it
as always is yeah um last night in your
talk you used the word of
course and that word
implies that there is a pattern and we
are to recognize that pattern and in
your work on
language you are interested in theep
patterns Universal
grammar and you work on politics
likewise you're interested in patterns
kind of a grammar of politics which you
sum up or describe in very plain
language as power profit and double
speak
um
now in the sense that this is how hagon
States corporations and media
behave um of course now in politics and
economics are there also questions that
perplex you that puzzle you that fall
outside the pattern or for which you
have not yet found a place in the
pattern or a name to give it oh plenty
of them in fact
U I just gave a series of lectures at
Colombia on philosophy department on uh
uh one of them was on the theme uh of
something I called 40 years ago problems
and
Mysteries it it's problems meaning by
that uh a distinction between uh matters
that we are in principle capable of
understanding we may not understand them
but they fall within our cognitive reach
it's you can imagine how we might
understand them those are problems uh
Mysteries simply fall beyond our
cognitive reach and those are quite deep
seated right in the physical sciences uh
they're not so recognized enough but uh
if you look over the history of the
physical sciences and then when you get
to the social sciences this magnifies
beyond the discussion but at the core of
the physical sciences the hard physical
sciences there are mysteries for humans
which are tacitly understood to be
beyond the level of understanding a
human understanding uh there's classic
moments of this uh you take the early
modern science Revol Scientific
Revolution which began basically with
Galileo and his contemporaries you know
early 17th century uh they wanted to
overcome neoc Scholastic uh mysticism
going back
to with its artian Origins they were
confronting a scientific World in which
explanation were given in terms of what
were called occult forces sympathies
antipathies Things fall to the ground
because that that's their natural place
so on and so forth they wanted to give
real Galileo and others wanted to give
real explanations and they had a concept
of explanation of
intelligibility uh namely it had to be a
mechanical
explanation uh the world had to be
accounted for as a machine and by
Machine they meant something very
concrete something that an artisan could
build something with gears and levers
and so on and so forth and in fact it
was supposed to have been built by a
super skilled Artisan uh so an exp an
intelligible account for SE Galileo
would be an account in terms of
mechanical principles was called the
mechanical philosophy and philosophy
just meant science in those days so
mechanic science the world is a
machine uh and uh Galileo recognized
that he was incapable he lamented at the
end of his life he'd been incapable of
accounting for the Motions of the of the
planets of the tides and so on in
mechanical terms so uh this was not yet
understood but the concept of
intelligibility was clear this goes
through the next Century uh the great
scientist
hyans deart liet Newton all believed in
the mechanical
philosophy and then a problem happened
and Newton discovered that it's false uh
the famous Body Mind problem is based on
the assumption that body is explicable
in mechanical terms mind decart
recognized that there are things that
aren't explicable in mechanical terms
terms actually the main one was normal
use of language for good reasons in fact
uh but so that was the basis of mind you
had these two substances Newton showed
there are no bodies he showed that
nothing is explicable in mechanical
terms there are no machines this is
totally misunderstood especially in the
social sciences uh where it's assumed
the mechanical that Newton showed that
the world operates by mechanical
principles it's big machine he showed
the opposite he showed that you cannot
account for it in mechanical terms
Newton regarded this as a complete
absurdity he said no person with any
scientific uh in uh intelligence could
accept this and he spent the rest of his
life trying to overcome it you had
various the problem was how can you
account for for Action at a distance
interaction without contact so how can
it be that if I move my hand I move the
moon you know uh there's no contact
that's the Mystical Force but uh and uh
uh he was correct it was an absurdity
but it was true and it points to
something that goes beyond the level of
human intelligence how can we deal with
a world that's based on occult forces
that we cannot
comprehend uh we have to accept them
because they're true but we can't
comprehend them well what happened and
this was well understood by his
contemporaries by John Lock later David
Hume right through the 18th century
since then has been forgotten uh the
concept science simply limited its goals
Sciences since Newton have not attempted
to develop a an intelligible account of
the universe they've lowered the goals
to trying to develop theories that are
intelligible that's a much lower goal
to understand a theory is one thing to
understand what it's talking about is
another thing but that goal has been
abandoned well there's a dramatic
example of something beyond the level of
human intelligence and it goes on from
there when you go into more complicated
things than basic physics it expands all
over the place so for example uh uh
human uh choice or animal Choice it's
completely unintelligible to us I mean
you can't deny that it Happ happens we
all know perfectly well that we make
choices and we make decisions but it's
completely it's not only beyond the
range of existing science no one has a
coherent idea of how you could explain
it probably because it lies beyond the
bounds of human cognitive capacities I
mean if you think of the things we can
understand they pretty much reduce to
determinism and Randomness so we
understand things being determined like
a machine you know you turn a lever and
something else turn uh that or a
thermostat I mean that kind of thing we
understand uh the concept of random uh
behavior that was understood in the 17th
century you know some things just happen
randomly uh but suppose something Falls
beyond the bounds of determinacy and
Randomness well it's beyond our
cognitive capacities and that's what
will and choice seem to be like so so
it's not hard to find things of the kind
you're talking about um maybe it is a
good idea to talk about something
simpler like
neoliberalism that's much simpler that's
easy that's easy to understand yes yeah
actually it's
misnamed the very idea of a a a struggle
that is for on only one side is
interesting here's a question n um when
we
criticize
neoliberalism we must show its
contradictions and its
limitations because otherwise we do
ourselves disservice and we play for the
wrong team the outside of
neoliberalism as I see it includes
Nordic capitalism my old neighborhood
and I know it well and part of emerging
economies emerging
societies elements of it not in the
sense that these are rose gardens but in
the sense that they are different and
the differences are robust do you share
that view partly but I think we ought to
take a closer look at the concept F
neoliberalism first of all is not new
and it's not liberal so the term
neoliberalism already is propaganda it's
very old oldfashioned class war
old-fashioned
imperialism uh neoliberalism is
basically the programs that were imposed
on what became the third world you go
back to the 18th century uh actually the
17th century the main Industrial and
Commercial centers of the world were
India and China uh and the difference
between the very rich and the very poor
was not very great maybe you know 3 to
one in countries uh but something
happened then uh the main thing that
happened is that what was called then
liberalism was imposed on the colonial
the colonized regions they were
compelled to follow Market principles
the rich never did the rich do not
tolerate markets for themselves uh for
very good reasons they're too
destructive uh so this first England
then the United States and Germany
France you know the rest of the
developed countries Japan uh imposed
uh highly State directed forms of
development um the United States was
quite striking you probably all know
this history but uh it's worth bearing
in mind uh the U when the colonies were
Liber ated they got advice on sound
economics from the greatest economists
of the day like Adam Smith and the
advice was follow the principles of
sound economics what we call
neoliberalism uh don't have tariffs no
protection uh because that you can prove
interferes with maximal
efficiency uh for the colonies that
meant use British manufactured goods
which are much better than yours uh
concentrate on what you're good at what
later came to be called comparative
advantage uh so it produce uh
agricultural ra raw materials
agricultural products fish fur and so on
and take Superior British manufactured
goods uh and uh crucially don't try to
monopolize uh the
commodities for which you have a natural
advantage and the important most
important one in those days of course
was cotton cotton was kind of like the
oil of the early Industrial Revolution
uh what did the colonies do exactly the
opposite in every respect very high
tariffs block Superior British
manufacturers uh develop your own
textile industry later in the century uh
the steel industry uh uh blocking
Superior British products and so on uh
all the way across the line a massive
State intervention in the economy uh the
railroads you know the conquest of the
territory extermination of the
population uh conquest of half of Mexico
slavery you know which is the most
extreme interference with Market
principles you can think of Monopoly
effort strong efforts to monopolize
cotton the Mexican war was foot largely
to try to and the annexation of Texas to
try to obtain a monopoly of cotton
actually the president's very explicit
about this the Jacksonian presidents
Tyler p and said yes if we can gain a
monopoly of cotton we can bring England
to our feet remember England was the big
enemy that was the powerful military
state it was blocking us expansion the
US couldn't conquer Canada it couldn't
conquer Cuba the British just too strong
but uh we could bring Britain to our
feet if we could monopolize cotton and
uh it came pretty close and of course
over the century the relations of power
shifted that's how the United States
developed right to the present if you
have a computer use the internet uh fly
an airplane uh uh you know use
Pharmaceuticals you're using the
products substantially created in the
dynamic State sector of the economy
right to the present uh well that's how
the United States developed it's the way
England developed before it it stole
technology from the low countries which
were more advanced from Ireland from
India of course uh and uh uh used
methods that are now blocked by the
World Trade Organization and called
piracy uh uh to tr to develop and it
became a you became the most powerful
industrial State and in fact uh
essentially without exception I mean
this city states like Hong Kong are
minor exceptions but this is the pattern
of development of the rich societies
meanwhile Market systems were forced
down the throat of the poor and they
became the third world that's
neoliberalism it's now an effort so how
is it applying to the Nordic capitalism
same way Europe right now is in the
midst of a extremely interesting process
by which the Europe is becoming
extremely
undemocratic uh I mean the Wall Street
Journal for example not great radical
Journal pointed out recently that was
something which is correct if you take a
look at European countries no matter
what government is in power they follow
exactly the same policies it could be a
communist run government a government of
the left government of the right they
follow pretty much the same policies
because the policies are dictated from
Brussels uh the policies are determined
by Brussels bureaucrats and the
bundesbank and so on uh the Nordic
countries are resisting a little but
it's being imposed by force on the south
uh that's the and what it's what it's
doing is uh take I me this policy of
austerity during recession I mean even
the IMF by now recognizes that it's
ludicrous from an economic point of view
um IMF economists have been publishing
papers recently saying you know this is
crazy it's a way to destroy an economy
they understand that but destroying the
economy is not a bad objective because
the goal remember is to establish a
plutonomy and a precariat the goal is
class war and that means uh undermine
and dismantle the welfare state the and
and the Nordic countries are partially
uh bending to this Sweden Norway and so
on they're holding back but uh it's the
old policy of the it's basically a
policy of class war which is constantly
fought China
Brazil
Taiwan well that's an interesting story
over the last generation the neoliberal
program sometimes called the Washington
consensus have been imposed on large
part part of the world but there has
been
resistance one region of resistance was
East Asia most of East Asia East and
Southeast Asia have somewhat resisted
this that's why you get the great growth
period uh they did not accept the rules
of the Washington consensus neoliberal
rules so for example take uh say South
Korea had a remarkable Industrial
Development in Taiwan too by completely
rejecting the rules very much the way
the American colonies had or Britain had
before it or Japan had after the major
restoration just violate the rules uh
radically I mean so radically that in
South Korea for example the export of
capital was not only blocked but you
could get the death penalty for it they
weren't fooling around uh and yes they
developed although it's backing off now
uh in many ways uh the other region
that's extremely significant I think is
uh South America uh and that's the last
decade I mean South America was a loyal
follower of the rules and it had two
devastating Decades of uh falling to
pieces under neoliberal rules the usual
result but in the early uh around 2000
it's began to move in a separate
Direction and by now South America is um
substantially independent and that's I
think a change of really historical
significance that's the first time in
500 years since the Conquistadors
arrived that South America has largely
freed itself from Imperial domination
last century or so that's meant us
domination and it's it's pretty
remarkable the way it's uh it's it's in
economic terms it's correct but in other
terms too so for example there was a
an ill striking illustration of this was
a couple of months ago there was a study
by the open Society Forum of uh
participation in rendition the rendition
is the most extreme form of torture
that's the form in which that's US
policy in which instead of torturing
people yourself you send them to your
favorite
dictator Assad Mubarak and zel tor them
for you and get out the information you
want or whatever you want to get from
them that's rendition this is the most
extreme form of torture that anybody's
everever devised uh this was a study of
which countries participated in and it
was the results were quite interesting
most of Europe participated including
the Nordic countries like Sweden they
participated actively and Ultra torture
uh the Middle East of of course cuz
that's where you sent people to be
tortured uh most of Canada the United
States obviously uh one region of the
world did refuse to participate South
America which is doubly remarkable for
one thing it used to just follow us
orders and secondly while it did it was
the center of world
torture uh that's uh a very striking
result and it's show showing up in other
ways too if you take take a look at uh
hemispheric conferences in the Western
Hemisphere by now the United States and
Canada are almost totally isolated the
last hemisphere conference in uh it was
in CA Colombia the uh they could never
reach a consensus on anything because
there was a split
between the United States and Canada on
the one side the rest of the hemisphere
on the other on the two major issues the
one major issue was admission of Cuba
into the Western Hemisphere uh South of
the Border almost unanimous in favor of
it US and Canada refuse the other major
issue was
drugs uh South of the Border they want
to move towards
decriminalization and some are going
even farther uh the United States and
Canada refused for the US and Canada the
drug war is very essential it's a
basically a race war and it's uh you
know the consequences and they want to
hang on to it well you know I Pro by now
the US and Canada are almost excluded
from the hemisphere and this is just a
dramatic change if you think about a
recent history that's so recent history
of hundreds of years so yes there is
resistance actually going back to
Southeast eastn southeast Asia if you'll
notice there's one country of the region
that has not participated ated in the
great growth period the Philippines the
one country that has been under Us
control for a century is not one of the
Asian tigers must be the ha of Asia
pardon must be the Haiti of
Asia um now shall we go to questions
from the
floor hello um what are your thoughts on
the ongoing talks between John KY and uh
Sergey LA lavro on um on the so-called
Syrian Civil War Syrian Civil War
Sy
well that's a really tragic situation I
mean Syria is simply plunging into
suicide and it's not easy to think of
anything to do about it at least I
haven't heard anything
sensible uh the country is moving
towards uh seems to be moving towards
partition
the Kurdish
areas have become pretty much autonomous
Assad has left them alone there's
battles going on between the Kurds and
the wide array of Rebel forces they
aren't a unified group and the Kurds
have gradually established a region
where they pretty much control it not
totally in fact they've even declared
autonomy they'll probably try to link
themselves up with Iraqi Kurdistan which
which is pretty near autonomous but
that's tricky because barzan the head of
Iraqi Kurdistan is opposed to the Syrian
Kurds he's trying to make a deal with
turkey for all kind of economic reasons
and a deal with turkey means suppressing
the Kurds the Kurds like most groups
have plenty of internal battles and uh
how that'll work out is not so obvious
but that's one part of Syria the rest of
Syria simply being
partitioned there's a part that all
being increasingly controlled by the
Assad forces backed by Iran Russia
hasbalah the other part is uh under the
control of
myriad Rebel groups which are fighting
among themselves meanwhile the Syrian
people are being decimated uh it's just
devastating a huge number of refugees uh
the refugees are being ref
issue is a very striking issue it's
interesting to see the way it's
discussed in the United States I mean
here we have what's called a huge
immigration problem you know we've got
these people coming in why are they
coming so for example why where I live
in around Boston there's a big Mayan
Community these are people coming from
Guatemala the May Mayan Highlands why
are they coming to the flee well you
know the country was the region was
subjected to a a genocidal War which the
US supported Reagan was a strong
supporter of it place is destroyed so
people flee come to the rich country so
it's illegal refugees we have to deport
them uh others are coming from Mexico
largely as a result of NAFTA predictable
effect of NAFTA was Wipe Out Mexican
agriculture so what happens next okay so
we have these illegal immigrants uh
Obama has broken all records he's
deported almost 2 million of them that's
the US now there are other countries
like say Lebanon and Jordan and Syria
and Iran where they absorb refugees huge
numbers of them I mean Lebanon for
example is a country of 4 million people
it has about 700,000 Palestinians and by
now about a million syrians okay for the
poor countries they're supposed to
absorb refugees actually absorb the
refugees that we
degenerate uh so the attack on Iraq
created nobody knows maybe million and a
half 2 million refugees okay they're
absorbed in the neighboring countries
like then Syria Jordan Iran Lebanon
that's their job their job is to absorb
the refugees that we generate our job is
to drive out the refugees who we
generate and this is discussed it's it's
not theor Nority of this it doesn't even
begin to be
discussed I mean maybe you can't do much
for Syria I don't know of a good
proposal but at least we could be taking
care of the refugees I mean this you
know it's about a million of them at
Lebanon why should Lebanon support them
we should support them in fact the
battle in Syria is become a part of
the growing Sunni Shia War around the
whole region that was inflamed by the
United States I mean in Iraq you know
there had been simmering conflicts but
there was never a sharp Sunni Shia
conflict until after the US invasion
which created it now it's spread over
the region it's devastating large parts
of the region we have a large share of
responsibility for it uh we're the ones
who should be supporting well that's
these are things you could do apart from
that if anybody has a suggestion I
haven't heard it in fact about the only
proposal that makes any sense is the lar
brahimi initiative through the United
Nations which Russia has supported and
Going Back Carry has mildly supported uh
it's a thin read you know if not easy to
see how it could work but if I there's
no other proposal that I know of
uh hello in Europe do you see a way out
of the Spiral of austerity and do you
think it could come from democratizing
the EU processes in the EU democratize
the EU democratizing the EU sure I mean
Europeans don't have to accept this
policy I they have pretty much there's
plenty of resistance like in Spain and
Greece uh uh the and other parts of
Europe there's substantial resistance it
has not yet been enough to abort it's
been enough to somewhat restrict the
policy so the policy the harshest
policies of imposing austerity have been
somewhat softened by now the you know
the European bank is a little
more Progressive and its reaction to
this I mean it's kind of hard to realize
but the United States has been more
Progressive than Europe since 2008 and
the European bank is kind of backing off
a little bit from its uh harsh policies
because of the resistance so sure it can
be overcome uh Greece it's significantly
there significant movements against it
Greece of course is being punished worse
than most the same with Spain but uh
it's well within the capacity of the
Europeans to protect the achievements of
the past generation I mean after all the
European welfare state is a non not a
trivial contribution to uh western
civilization and it's being dismantled
consciously and it can be protected of
course you can go beyond that that's not
the limit by any means so yes it's uh I
don't Ian it's really a limit of Will
and
commitment same here I mean we don't
have to tolerate what's going on here
we would keep this uh 40 minutes we are
a few minutes over time no is that okay
sure oh please well I asked you a
question last night and let me ask a
more critical question but uh at they
start making a statement uh I believe I
have a solution uh to the question that
you ask uh do we have any problem any
solution for Syria yes I think we do
please yeah but as long as in this
country we have 94
Senators
29
congressmen that receive money from
agency that was recognized in
1963 as a tool of the Israeli government
IAP Pac we are not going anywhere we
have surrendered our falling policy
entire
thank
you that's uh it's a very convenient
view in the United States convenient
because it directs attention away from
the centers of power in the United
States and anything that directs
attention away from the centers of power
is almost guaranteed to be
popular uh this is a common view it's
it's understandable there are leading
Scholars who've advocated it John Sher
and Steven Walt are the main ones it
just doesn't make any sense I mean the
Israeli I mean you're right that many of
the people in Congress get benefits from
APAC but practically 100% of them are in
the pockets of the Thunders the
corporate sector that's how they got
elected there's a very close correlation
between campaign funding and electoral
Victory uh very close in fact in the
house of repres it's almost a straight
line uh few deviants here and there like
Bernie Sanders but it's uh you know it's
almost uniform and these are this is big
money it's not APAC apac's a ethnic
Lobby you know it's of some significance
but it doesn't begin to compare with the
major lobbies I mean the military Lobby
itself could put APAC out of business in
2 minutes if they want it it's way more
powerful why don't they do it they don't
want to they support Apex
policies uh they benefit from it let's
take say locked Martin uh when the
United States gives $3 billion of uh Aid
to Israel what's called aid for purchase
of military equipment a lot of that goes
right back to Lockheed Martin in two
ways first of all they get paid for uh
developing you know the F 135 and so on
uh they get paid by the US taxpayer via
Israel
secondly uh when we give a couple of
billion dollars of military aid to
Israel Saudi Arabia comes along and says
we want 10 times as much uh for
ourselves and locked Martin isn't very
happy to provide Saudi Arabia with uh
second rate equipment which they don't
know how to operate anyhow and they're
getting a $60 billion aid grant as
compared with Israel's 30 billion three3
billion all terrific for the military uh
directly for the mil for military
industry furthermore there are much
there are extremely close
interactions uh you some of you may have
seen one of the most important uh leaks
from Wikileaks didn't get much publicity
was quite important it was a list of uh
a pentagon list of strategic sites High
super high value strategic sites around
the world that have to be protected you
know above all else one of them was uh
Raphael military Industries right
outside hia uh major military complex uh
closely integrated with the US military
it's one of the places where drone
technology was developed for example uh
so closely integrated that
Raphael transferred its management
offices to Washington and his
industry its offices are in Washington
because that's where the money is uh and
that's just symptomatic of extremely
close relations uh high-tech industry in
the United States like say IBM and so on
they increasing their investments in
Israel not because they love Jews it's
just a good place for them to invest
actually Warren Buffett just spent
couple billion dollars picking up some
industry there and said it's the best
place to invest outside the United
States and it's uh uh close intelligence
connections and so on so why doesn't the
military Lobby uh stand against APAC
because they support the policies they
do uh the same is true of uh uh other
sectors and in fact when the US opposes
Israeli policy which happens
regularly APAC disappears in fact it's
happening right now in front of our eyes
uh apex's leading goal was to try to P
get the Senate to pass
legislation that would essentially block
the Iran us
negotiations I mean it's uh uh in this
particular case APAC backed off but it's
happened over and over I mean even
George W bush very
pro-israel uh there was one point at
which
there was a real conflict with Israel
Israel is a military based economy
high-tech military production they want
export markets the big export Market of
course is China so they've been dying to
get into the China Market us won't let
them uh the most recent occasion was
2005 under Bush when Israel was trying
to
upgrade missiles for China and the US
Bush Administration said you can't do it
they said they were going to do it
anyway at which point the US came down
on them like a ton of bricks uh it
insisted it blocked visits from
highlevel Israeli officials they were
not allowed to visit the United States
they were compelled to issue a formal
apology for having tried to do this uh
and to pass legislation blocking it real
humiliation you didn't hear a peep from
from APAC out of this the reason is
they're not idiots they know they cannot
confront us power and when there is a
conflict they back down this happens
time after time I could for time I could
give you a long list so there's good
reasons
for but I think we should be cautious
about initially about any proposal that
directs attention away from the centers
of American power
it's always going to be convenient to
accept a proposal like that doesn't
prove that it's wrong but it's an
initial reason for skepticism I think
one more question please all thank you
Professor Chomsky um in terms of
reigniting the democratic processes here
at home uh what role do you think
whistleblowing has to
play
whistleblowing what Ro you think of
reigniting reigniting the democratic
process here reigniting democracy here
um also do you think whistleblowing will
ever be institutionalized so that people
like Snowden or journalists like Glenn
Greenwell don't have to run away for
their lives sure we should uh I mean we
should try to De democratize the society
it's not impossible after all I mean it
used to be there used to be a
quip I think maybe it went back to see R
Mills I don't recall that the United
States is a one- party State the
business party with two factions the
Democrats and the Republicans which are
different that's not entirely true
anymore it's now it's still a one party
State the business party but there's
only one faction and it's not Democrats
it's moderate
Republicans uh the people who are the
Democratic party today is overwhelmingly
what used to be called moderate
Republicans meanwhile the Republican
party soall has just drifted totally off
the Spectrum not part of the
parliamentary system anymore and that's
actually recognized by the most uh
prestigious conservative commentators so
for example Norman orstein
famous conservative political analyst
very American Enterprise Institute you
know right-wing he simply describes the
Republican party today as a radical
Insurgency which has abandoned
parliamentary principles and you can see
it in the last eight years their only
policies have been of course to enrich
the super rich and to block anything
that's done in Washington period that's
been very successful remarkably
successful report came out I think
yesterday in the New York Times of the
uh looking at recent polls on this and
they're very interesting turns out they
talking about the midterm elections that
are coming up there a lot of polls about
it uh uh the public largely supports the
policies of the
Democrats which the Democrats themselves
don't support but the supposed part you
know like higher taxes on the rich and
you know Medical Care and so on public
supports those at the same time the
public prefers the
Republicans and when you looked at the
reasons it's because the public is
infuriated about what's called
dysfunctional
Washington the Press is always talking
about this gridlock in Washington
dysfunctional
Washington dysfunctional Washington
means the Republicans are committed to
block anything that
happens okay so it's dysfunctional
Washington blamed on the Democrats
public prefers the Republicans but
opposes their
policies okay this is really clever
politics it makes people believe there's
a political system uh people are driven
into acting in extremely irrational ways
it's not the first time so for example
in 2012 there were 2012 elections there
were polls you know ton of polls go on a
very interesting they on attitude you
know attitudes towards policy issues and
towards political preferences and
they're striking to see how they
separate so for example one major study
of uh Southern uh uh Southern tea party
people you know that that category
people identifi themselves that way most
of them are social Democrats uh they
support higher spending on uh Health on
education on uh Aid to the poor not
welfare course rean demonized that but
Aid to the poor you know things like
that uh but higher taxes on the rich uh
but at the same time they support
Republican the Republican Party
which is exactly the opposite it's you
take a place like actually Cal there was
a study of California recently uh which
uh investigated attitudes towards uh big
what they call Big government you know
taxes and stuff uh there was a very
close correlation between the amount of
Aid that people got from the federal
government and their opposition to the
federal government so when you get to
the kind of you know rural
poor areas they're getting an awful lot
of aid from the federal government and
they want to get the government off our
backs you know I mean to try to instill
these kinds of attitudes into people is
a real achievement and that's the
opening to get back to your first point
to the
99% you can overcome this you know this
is not like fighting uh the secret
police you know you're not you don't get
thrown into the prisons for uh getting
people to understand these things this
is an opportunity for Real uh organizing
work which can be
done no I noticed today and in the past
days people cherish you for your
contributions people love you for your
work thank you very much thank you
