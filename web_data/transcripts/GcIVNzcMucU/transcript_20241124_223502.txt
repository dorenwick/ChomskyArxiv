uh I'm very pleased to have an
opportunity to say a few words at the uh
alany United National anti-war
Conference and I'm sorry that
circumstances make it impossible for me
to be with be there with you in
person uh there's no need to elaborate
on the significance of the task that
you're undertaking or the scale of the
challenge we all know that very well
uh to repeat some things well known to
all of us the United States spends about
as much on war and preparation for War
as the rest of the world combined it's
technologically far more advanced uh
there are plans on the books for future
Wars that range from uh tiny drones that
can murder people in their living rooms
to space platforms for near
instantaneous and massive
destruction uh anywhere in the world the
United States is responsible for about
70% of arm sales and the United States
is alone in baring a global treaty in
regulating the global arms trade
actually for accuracy the United States
is not quite alone uh it was joined by
Zimbabwe in the latest vote at the
United Nations a fact which is
apparently too too embarrassing to Merit
reporting the United States is of course
now fighting two Wars of aggression in
Asia and it's planning a third uh
military spending is escalating to
unprecedented Heights under
Obama uh much concern is being whipped
up about the deficit let's put aside the
fact that we should be running a deficit
to grow out of the economic catastrophe
that
was caused by the financial institutions
that are now put in charge of putting
Band-Aids on the cancer for which
they're primarily responsible along with
their representatives in Washington but
taking the deficit seriously about half
of it is due to military spending and
the rest is mostly due to the hopelessly
inefficient and costly Health Care
System imposed by the same hands but the
obvious way to ways to deal with the
deficit are off the agenda rather
attention is focused on depriving poor
people of their meager benefits well
considerations such as these uh are
serious enough for those who care about
this this country but they're of course
marginal as compared with the costs to
the victims of our dedication to
criminal violence all omit the
horrifying details which are familiar to
all of us well I happen to be speaking a
month before your meeting in Albany and
the current pace of events is so fast
that what I say is sure to be outdated
by the time you meet at least in part uh
I'm speaking shortly after the mistal
Fiasco and in fact on the day of the
confirmation of his Superior General
ener Petraeus as his replacement it's
generally assumed and quite plausibly
that among the consequences of this
change will be relaxation of the Rules
of Engagement so that it becomes easier
for us forces to kill civilians and also
extension of the war well into the
future as Petraeus uses his considerable
clout in Congress to achieve this result
uh the same May well be true of the war
in Iraq we I won't through the run
through the ugly history of that but
we'll only mention one crucial feature
of that war the US Invaders were
compelled to retreat step by step from
their initial War aims that's a major
Triumph of uh Mass nonviolent resistance
in Iraq the Invaders were quite
competent that killing insurgents but
they could not deal with hundreds of
thousands of
demonstrators uh calling for elections
that the occupying authorities sought
desperately first to avoid then when
they couldn't prevent them to subvert
these facts are of course denied by
apologists but they're understood by the
most serious analysts uh one good
example is the fine British
correspondent and Middle East specialist
was Jonathan steel his important book on
the war is called defeat quite
accurately uh as the US was forced to
back down War aims came to be St stated
with greater Clarity uh the usual
boilerplate about democracy did not
suffice as Washington uh sought to hang
on in the face of Iraqi resistance uh
and domestic opposition to the war that
it was unable to quell uh in November
2000 the Bush Administration issued a
declaration of principles for the United
States and the Iraqi government the
Declaration states that the US forces
are to remain indefinitely in Iraq and
it commits Iraq to facilitate and
encourage the flow of foreign
investments to Iraq especially American
Investments I'm
quoting this this Brazen expression of
Imperial will was underscored a few
months later when Bush issued another
one of his signing statements in this he
declared I'll quote here that he'll
reject crucial provisions of
congressional legislation that he had
just signed including the provision that
forbids spending taxpayer money to
establish any military installation or
base for the purpose of providing for
the permanent stationing of United
States armed forces in Iraq or to
exercise Us control of the oil resources
of Iraq in short nothing of that kind
will be tolerated even if it's passed by
Congress and signed by the president
well that was January
2008 that was a last gasp shortly after
that the Bush Administration was
compelled to sign a status of forces
agreement with Iraq that eliminated all
of these demands at least formally And I
stress formally the United States is
committed to withdraw its forces in
2011 and in fact us forms have us firms
oil firms have not done well at all in
the competition for Iraqi resources but
again I stress formally there's very
little reporting from Iraq and
information is quite Spark
uh it does appear however that uh
construction of the huge military bases
US military bases is continuing and it's
explicit that Obama has budgeted a
substantial increase for the huge US
Embassy in Baghdad not like any Embassy
anywhere in the world it's in fact a
city within a city and Obama has also
budgeted similar proposals for Islam
Abad and Kabul all of this indicates
plainly enough that the Obama
Administration is preparing for a long
stay uh with a heavy
footprint well as if two wars in the
region are not enough Obama's now
building up for a third war against Iran
it's widely claimed that Iran poses the
most severe crisis facing the United
States uh Congress has just strengthened
the sanctions against Iran uh Obama has
been rapidly expanding its offensive
capacity in the African island of Diego
Garcia which is claimed by Britain
Britain had expelled the population so
that the United States could uh build
the massive military base that it uses
for attacking the Middle East and
Central Asia uh the Navy is expanding
facilities is there for nuclear powered
guided missile submarines with tomahawk
missiles which can carry nuclear
warheads uh each submarine is reported
to have the Striking power of a typical
Naval carrier battle group the Obama uh
buildup also includes hundreds of
so-called bunker Buster bombs the most
powerful in the Arsenal short of nuclear
weapons these are intended for uh
blasting hardened underground structures
aimed for Iran of course the planning
for these uh bombs began under Bush but
languished Obama accelerated the program
sharply as soon as he took office and
they're now to be deployed years ahead
of schedule of course aimed at
Iran very respect respected British
strategic analyst Dan plush he points
out I'm quoting him they're gearing up
totally for the destruction of Iran the
US bombers and long range missiles are
ready today to destroy 10,000 Targets in
Iran in a few hours the Firepower of US
forces has quadrupled since
2003 accelerating rapidly under
Obama uh a US Fleet along with an
Israeli Naval vessel is reported to have
passed through the Suz Canal on the way
to the Persian Gulf where its task
according to Arab press reports I'm
quoting is to implement the sanctions
against Iran and supervise the ships
going to and from
Iran uh the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen visited
Afghanistan a couple of days ago a
couple of days before I'm speaking on
his return he went to Israel to meet
senior Military Officers and plan
the major Israeli newspaper hararat
reports I'm quoting that the meeting
focused on the preparation by both
Israel and the United States for the
possibility of a nuclear capable Iran uh
almost none of this has been reported
here uh although or or maybe a cynic
might say because it's plainly of
extreme significance and
urgency these uh increasing threats of
military action against Iran are of
course in violation of the United
Nations Charter and they're also in
specific violation of Security Council
resolution
1887 of September 2009 which reaffirmed
the call to all states to resolve
disputes related to nuclear issues
specifically peacefully uh in accordance
with the charter uh which they're
speaking specifically of the reg of the
Middle East region the charter of course
bans the use or the threat of force uh
well what exactly is the Iranian threat
there are many apoc apocalyptic
pronouncements but they don't descend to
the level of evidence or argument
there's also an authoritative answer it
was provided by several government
reports to Congress uh on the military
threat of Iran last April the uh brutal
clerical regime in Iran is doubtless a
threat to its own people but it does not
rank particularly high in that respect
in comparison to US allies in the region
particularly Egypt which Obama went out
of its way to
praise uh and of course it's not the
threat to the population of Iran that
concerns the report rather it's
concerned with the threat that Iran
poses poses to the region and to the
world well the report makes it clear
that the Iranian threat is not
military quote the report Iran's
military spending is relatively low
compared to the rest of the region and
of course minuscule as compared to that
of the
US uh they say that Iranian military
Doctrine I'm quoting again is strictly
defensive designed to slow an invasion
and force a diplomatic solution to
hostilities uh Iran they say has only a
limited capability to project Force
Beyond its borders uh what about the
nuclear option well the report says that
Iran's nuclear program and its
willingness to keep open the possibility
of developing nuclear weapons is a
central part of its deterrent strategy
not
offensive uh though the Iranian threat
is not military that does not mean that
it might be tolerable to
Washington uh Iranian deterrent capacity
is an illegitimate exercise of
sovereignty that interferes with us
Global designs specifically it threatens
Us control of Middle East energy
resources that's been a very high
priority of planners since World War II
they recognized that uh uh control of
Middle East energy resources provides
substantial control of the world quoting
one influential liberal Democrat 60
years ago expressing a common
understanding that's AA
Burley uh uh Iran's threat goes beyond
deterrence it's also seeking to expand
its
influence that's called destabilizing
the
region the US invasion and military
occupation of Iran's Neighbors that's
called
stabilization uh Iran's effort to extend
its influence in neighboring countries
is
destabilization H plainly illegitimate
which is incidentally normal
usage uh beyond the crimes of deterrence
and trying to establish friendly
relations with neighbors uh Iran is also
supporting terrorism the government's
reports continue by backing hasbalah and
Hamas and Hamas happen to be the major
political forces in Lebanon and in
Palestine that is if elections matter in
this case the only relatively free
elections in the Arab world well it's
normal and understandable for elite
opinion to fear the threat of democracy
and to act to deterr it but this is a
rather striking case particularly
alongside of strong us support for the
brutal Regional dictatorships well
there's a lot to say about the terrorist
acts attributed to Hamas and hasbalah
which pale in comparison to US Israeli
terrorism in the same region and in
large measure our resistance to us
Israeli aggression and violence and they
could also easily be terminated if the
United States and Israel wanted to do so
the case of Hamas that means accepting
ceasefires and in general accepting
political settlement instead of
preferring violence brutal reprension
and expansion as they're doing they're
recognizing that they're in violation of
international law and even specific
Security Council resolutions well that's
a long topic I've talked and written
about it elsewhere as of others and I
won't go into it here uh there is a
model for democracy in in the Middle
East in the Muslim world uh despite
serious flaws namely turkey which has
relatively free elections and has also
been subject to harsh criticism in the
US particularly by the Obama
Administration uh which was particularly
incensed just a few weeks ago when
turkey joined with Brazil in arranging a
deal with Iran to restrict Iran's
enrichment of uranium the deal was
pretty much along the lines that the US
had in fact demanded uh Obama had
praised this initiative in a l a letter
to Brazil's president Lula D Silva pres
apparently he did that on the assumption
that the initiative would fail and would
provide a propaganda weapon against
Iran well the initiative succeeded uh
the US was Furious and quickly
undermined it by ramming through a
security Council resolution that was so
meaningless that China cheerfully joined
at once uh recognizing that at most The
Limited sanctions would impede Western
interests in competing with China for
Iran's resources uh once again
Washington acted forthrightly to ensure
that others would not interfere with us
control of the region whatever the
effect on
proliferation the political class
understands very well the threat of
independent forces in the region
so Steven Cook who's a scholar with the
Council on Foreign Relations he pointed
out that the critical question now is in
his words how do we keep the Turks in
their Lane uh following orders like good
Democrats uh a New York Times headline
captured the general mood it reads Iran
deal seen as spot on Brazilian leaders
Legacy uh in brief do what we say or
else uh you'll suffer the consequences
if that's unclear any mafia Don can
explain uh there's no indication that
other countries in the region favor us
sanctions any more than turkey does on
Iran's opposite border that Pakistan and
Iran have just signed an agreement for a
new pipeline signed it in Turkey in fact
uh even more worrisome for the United
States is that the pipeline might extend
to India the US has been trying hard to
stop that in 2008 the United States
reached a treaty with India supporting
India's nuclear programs which
indirectly supports its nuclear weapons
programs and that was pretty clearly
intended to stop India from joining the
pipeline uh India and Pakistan
incidentally are two of the three
nuclear powers that have refused to sign
the nonproliferation treaty the third
one is Israel all have developed nuclear
weapons with us support and still do
under
Obama well no sane person wants Iran to
develop nuclear weapons or for that
matter anyone uh one obvious way to
mitigate or maybe eliminate this threat
is to establish a nuclear weapon weapons
free zone uh in the Middle East now that
issue arose once again at the
nonproliferation treaty conference at
the UN headquarters in early May uh of
this year Egypt is the chair of the 100
118 nations of the non-aligned movement
and as chair it proposed that the
conference back a plan calling for the
start of negotiations on a Middle East
nuclear weapons free zone as in fact U
had agreed been agreed by the West
including the United States at the 1995
review conference on the
nonproliferation treaty well Washington
was kind of backed into a corner and it
formally agreed but it insisted that
Israel be Exempted and of course it has
given no hint of allowing such
Provisions Provisions to apply to itself
uh Secretary of State Hillary Clinton uh
stated yeah wonderful idea but she said
the time is not right uh Washington also
insisted that no proposal can be
accepted that calls for Israel's nuclear
program to be placed under the opes of
the international atomic energy agency
as in fact the energy agency is now
advocating though without report here uh
and insist us again insisted that no
proposal can be accepted that calls on
signers of the treaty including
Washington to release information about
Israeli nuclear facilities and
activities including information
pertaining to previous nuclear transfers
to Israel I'm quoting Washington's
position all of that is blocked Obama's
technique of evasion is to adopt
Israel's position that any such proposal
for a nuclear weapons free zone must be
conditional on on a comprehensive peace
settlement which the United States can
delay indefinitely as it's been doing
for 35 years with rare and temporary
exceptions well Obama of course has made
a rhetorical commitment to
nonproliferation that's received much
praise even a Nobel Peace Prize uh one
practical step in this direction is
establishment of nuclear weapons free
zones uh another is withdrawing support
for the nuclear weapons programs of the
three non-signers of the
nonproliferation treaty well as often is
the case uh rhetoric and actions are
hardly aligned in fact they're indirect
contradiction in this
case uh facts that pass with essentially
no comment or attention well instead of
taking practical steps towards reducing
the dire threat of nuclear weapons
proliferation the United States is
proceeding to take major steps towards
reinforcing Us control of the vital
Middle East oil producing regions by
violence if other means do not succeed
with very ugly prospects well let me
turn finally briefly to Obama's major
current War
Afghanistan the official goal is to
protect ourselves from Al Al-Qaeda
Al-Qaeda is what's called a virtual
organization with no specific base the
professional literature describes it as
a network of networks an example of
what's called leaderless resistance
that's even more so now than before
whatever Al-Qaeda is it has relatively
independent factions loosely associated
throughout the world as for Afghanistan
the CIA estimate is that there may be 50
to 100 Al-Qaeda activists in Afghanistan
and there isn't the slightest indication
that the Taliban want to repeat the
mistake of offering Sanctuary to
Al-Qaeda which raises questions about
what we're doing in
Afghanistan well uh there is a new
strategy as you know and the first
exercise of Obama's new strategy U was
when US Marines recently conquered Mara
small town in Helman province which is
the main center of the Insurgency here's
the report about that from The New York
Times quote the Marines have collided
with a Taliban identity in margia so
dominant that the movement appears more
akin to the only political organization
in a one party town with influence that
touches
everyone uh we've got to re-evaluate our
definition of the word enemy so said
Brigadier General Larry Nicholson
commander of the Marine Expeditionary
force in Helmont Province continuing
with nichelson most people here identify
themselves as Taliban we have to
readjust their thinking so we're not
trying to chase the Taliban out of
margia we're trying to chase the enemy
out namely the
Taliban well you can parse that if you
like uh but the Marines are actually
facing a problem that has always been
deviled conquerors and that is very
familiar to the United States from
Vietnam back in the early 60s the
leading US Government scholar uh
lamented that the enemy was as he put it
the only truly mass-based political
party in South Vietnam and any effort to
compete with it politically would be
like a conflict between a minnow and a
whale uh our minow their whale uh
therefore the only strategy us could
undertake is to overcome the enemy's
political force by using Washington's
comparative advantage and violence with
horrifying results that I don't have to
review uh others have faced similar
problems for example the Russians in
Afghanistan in the 1980s where they won
every battle but lost the war although
it's interesting to learn from the top
us experts there who were fighting with
the mujahadin in the80s and who now say
that the Russians were indeed beginning
to make progress by the mid 80s when
they adopted the now fashionable
Petraeus coin strategy and the same
experts agree that they might have won
had it not been for the massive support
for the mujahadin by the United States
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan which included
high-tech weapons that neutralized the
Russian helicopter forces also well to
remember that the goal according to the
CIA officially was not to liberate
Afghanistan but to kill Russians the US
faces No Such opposition in
Afghanistan well after the U Mara
Triumph the US Le forces were poised to
assault the major city of
Kandahar uh the US Army took polls there
which it released and discovered and
reported that the military operation is
opposed by 95% of the population and
that five out of six people there regard
the Taliban as in their words our Afghan
Brothers well that's again Echoes of
earlier
conquests for these reasons the plans
were delayed that's part of the
background for the mistal
Fiasco well under these circumstances
it's not in the least surprising that
the authorities are concerned that
domestic public support now low May Road
even
farther there was a recently leaked CIA
memorandum which observes that the
Afghanistan mission's low public
salience has allowed French and German
leaders to disregard public popular
opposition and to steadily increase
their troop contributions to the US War
despite the opposition of 80% of the
German and French Public public it's
therefore necessary they say to tailor
messaging to forestall or at least
contain backlash and several proposals
follow for how to delude the public uh
in the United States the media can be
counted on to fulfill the needed role
voluntarily well this CIA memorandum
should remind us that states have an
internal enemy their own population
which has to be controlled when State
policy is opposed by the public
as is often the case the battle to
control the internal enemy is highly
pertinent today and it should be a prime
concern for those who hope to confront
today's severe challenges as you're now
doing and your task could hardly be more
important thanks
