[Music]
hello everyone and welcome back to
palestine chronicle tv
we are joined today by a very special
guest professor nam chomsky
renowned intellectual linguist author
professor emeritus of linguistics at mit
professor chomsky has written
extensively
about the palestinian cause for decades
in addition of course to numerous other
subjects including linguistics politics
geopolitics human rights and mass media
after israel's war on gaza in 2014
chomsky co-authored the book on
palestine with renowned historian
professor ilan pepe
among his many other books he also
authored peace in the middle east
reflections on justice and nationhood
the faithful triangle the united states
israel and the palestinians and gaza in
crisis reflections on israel's war
against the palestinians also
co-authored with professor pape
professor chomsky first of all
thank you very much for taking the time
from your very busy schedule to join us
and welcome to the show
in a lecture in october 2014
the united at the united nations you
stated that quote
the united states government should
first and foremost comply with united
states legislations
the so-called
lihila for example
prohibited the united states from
providing weapons to any foreign
military units that consistently
committed human rights violations the
israeli army and this is still your
quote was committing massive human
rights violations and
consequently the provisions of arms to
israel by the united states violated
united states law
professor chomsky how realistic
do you think it would be to expect a
major shift in u.s foreign policy
regarding washington's military and
financial support to israel in other
words
do you feel that there are margins
within the current u.s foreign policy
agenda to alter washington's attitude
towards israel and palestine
that there is a relation
between
u.s government policy and human rights
and it has been investigated in great
detail
the basic principle is that
the greater the violation of human
rights
the more the u.s gives support and aid
to it
almost exactly the opposite of
what's
commonly claimed but it's quite easy to
demonstrate uh take just today
by far the most
u.s
uh foreign aid
incomparably more than anyone else
goes to one of the worst human rights
violators
in the world
state of israel it's the only state that
has carried out uh
illegal
brutal occupation
70 years
violation of security council orders
it's even a next foreign territory in
violation of exquisite security council
orders
i don't have to run through the
harsh and brutal nature of the
occupation
but that's
uh
ranks high among
global human rights violators
uh it's alone in these respects uh
actually
human rights watch and amnesty
international is you know
a very conservative organizations
recently simply
recognized it as
the world's only apartheid state
so it certainly ranks value by any
measure
and it's
just out of sight as far as usaid goes
well the second highest recipient of
usaid is egypt
that's actually connected to the aid in
israel by the law
egypt now is under the
harshest most brutal
dictatorship of its
ugly history
some
60 000 people
in prison
dissenting
torture
one of them
a couple of years ago been in prison for
years
uh an honest dissident torture
isolated and there's case after case
and it's a horrible situation so that's
the second highest
uh
recipient of usaid if you look at u.s
military aid
it's even more clear
you go through the years
the leading recipient of u.s military
aid has usually been
the
most severe human rights violator
so in the 1990s
when turkey was carrying out
horrendous atrocities against its
own kurdish population
tens of thousands of people killed
thousands of towns and villages
destroyed
every imaginable kind of terror of
torture and
ill treatment
uh hundreds of thousands of people
driven from their homes to
miserable slums in istanbul and visited
them there
was the highest recipient of usaid uh
before that it replaced colombia which
had been the
leading human rights violator
the highest recipient of usaid before
that it was el salvador it was
slaughtering its own citizens with usaid
and in fact as
late edward herman and i showed out
showed years ago back
in the 1970s
if you looked at the
amnesty international
record of torture
and compared worldwide
comparative with usaid they're very
closely correlated
so okay that's uh
that's the general point
with regard to u.s law
there's a very interesting situation
which in the
tightly controlled doctrinal system of
the united states you're not allowed to
discuss i've
the united states is a pretty free
country so when i talk about it i'm not
thrown into jail you're allowed to talk
about it as long as nobody hears what
you're saying
so i'll do that again
uh supposedly according to the united
states
the greatest one of the greatest threats
to world peace
is iranian nuclear programs
the united states pulled out of the
agreement on nuclear programs in
violation of security council orders
it then turned to
punishing iran
for u.s withdrawal from the agreement
very harsh sanctions
now
iran is reacting it's not allowing
observers international observers to see
its programs where israel is continuing
with its policies of assassination and
sabotage so israel has
unique rights in the world thanks to u.s
support it's allowed to assassinate
scientists to blow up
installments basically anything it wants
and it's reason to it because it didn't
do it and there's
then come iranian reactions and
threats to
israeli scientists in turkey much
outraged about that
and constant threat of moving on to new
the general war
well is there a solution to this problem
yes very simple one establish a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the middle east
with inspections which work
american intelligence agreed that the
inspections under the
joint agreement worked very well so no
problem so what's stopping it
is anybody opposed
not iran iran is strongly in favor of it
not the arab states in fact they
initiated this demand 30 years ago and
i've been insisting on it ever since
not the global south they're all
strongly in favor of it
no objections from europe
so what's the problem
washington
every time the issue comes up in an
international forum
the us vetoes it including obama
uh
no report about this this just happens
but why does the usv to it
everybody knows but nobody's allowed to
see
it's obvious
if there is a nuclear weapons-free zone
israel's huge nuclear weapons arsenal
will have to be inspected the u.s won't
allow that
in fact the u.s does not officially
acknowledge their existence
everyone knows they have it but you
can't acknowledge it
why
now we're back to u.s law u.s law has
provisions
like the samington amendment couple of
others
that
make it
arguably illegal
for the united states to send any
military aid or maybe any aid at all to
israel because of its violation of
the international regime on nuclear
weapons well neither political party
wants to open that door
press won't report it
in fact it's kind of interesting to
watch
how they
try to evade it
so for example the new
weapons free zone
for the persian gulf region
excluding israel
the only nuclear weapon state has to be
excluded
and they said why they said this is
non-negotiable okay
so we can't discuss it
that's the closest anyone has come in
the public even to acknowledge the
possibility
so we race on to a possible war because
we have to protect
probably arguably illegal usaid to
israel
now there are other provisions
there's what's called the leahy law
patrick lay
which bans
u.s military aid
to any
military
unit which is engaged in
systematic human rights violations
well
the idf is
israeli army
is up to its neck in uh
human consistent human rights violations
not even a question
so aid to israel is banned under u.s law
it's kind of interesting and important
that right now it's finally becoming
possible
to bring this issue up
and have somebody listen
in fact there was actually a
congressional original resolution by
betsy mccollum michigan
uh for uh
banning usaid and violation of the lady
law didn't get anywhere of course barely
reported but the fact that this is
becoming
an issue
on the public agenda is very significant
it's part of there's a background to
this
the background is that
u.s popular attitudes towards israel and
palestine have been shifting
that's of immense importance
that's in fact the hope for
some
form of resolution of this
horrible oppression of palestinians
u.s
position is decisive
obviously
you go back a decade or two
support israel
is basically israel was the darling of
the liberal community in the united
states
liberal intellectuals raved about israel
the
young people went to
israel to see this marvelous flourishing
social democracy
and so on that was a couple of decades
ago
not now
it's shifted strikingly actually i can
see it
very well in my own
experience up until about 15 years ago
if i wanted to give a talk on israel and
palestine i literally had to have police
protection
even on my own campus
the police insisted on
welcoming me back to my car afterwards
meetings were broken up violently it's
uh you had to have air airport security
for a meeting
even if i was giving lectures at some
university on philosophy lectures
and one of the talks i was giving was on
the middle east
campus police insisted on
accompanying me the whole time
that's changed in fact you can date the
change
the big dramatic change was after cass
led
to 2008 2009 the
atrocities were so extreme that it
really broke through you saw an enormous
change by now it's totally different
give a talk
thousands of people show up can't get a
hostile question
attitudes have just shifted
uh support for israel today today in the
united states
is
from the christian nationalist
evangelical movements and
the security
related
systems military and police
far-right ultra-nationalists
big shift
that has not yet
led to a change in policy but it could
and if it does the whole situation
changes
you go back to the
1970s
israel made a fateful decision
it had a chance
for peace at the time
very clearly
uh had a chance for a peaceful
settlement
the i could go through the details
israel
thought about it rejected it this is
incidentally the labor party this is not
the right wing
decided to expand
they chose expansion
over security
that
entailed
full reliance on the united states to
protect them
and that means that when the united
states lifts its finger
israel has to obey has no choices
that's actually happened over and over
matthew obama was the first u.s
president
not to force israel to do something it
didn't want to do
it's uh
and of course trump just went all out
you know let them do whatever they want
biden hasn't changed
but if u.s policy changes
even a threat to change
that would change the situation in
israel dramatically they have no choices
they have to follow u.s orders
they're trying to get around it in
interesting ways
with
alliances among the most reactionary
states in the world
this is hailed in the west as a great
achievement
but think about it like the abraham
accords
that's an alliance
between the most reactionary states
in
the middle east
north african region
including israel which is drifted
forward to the right
well that's a natural
alliance for israel you go to europe
israel's strongest ally in europe is
hungary
the
outlier in europe the so-called
illiberal democracy which is crushing
democracy and
shares values with israel
it's a racist
uh
exclusiveness that wants to crush its
minorities
it's
violating human civil rights and israel
and hungary
share a grievance
psychological namely they both feel that
they're being unfairly treated
by liberal opinion in the west
that's
psychological connection so the relation
is close
uh relations are developing between
israel and
modi's india
which
is dismantling indian secular democracy
uh imposing a hindu ethnocracy
uh
violating
civil and human rights
occupied kashmir brutally suppressed it
all kind of anti-muslim legislation
very natural ally of israel
so this there is a kind of
reactionary international developing
pretty much run by washington
where israel plays a central role
but if opinion
changes in the united states and
influences policy
that could have a substantial impact
very good uh thank you very much for
this professor chomsky please do allow
me to bring in my co-host and the
managing editor of the palestine
chronicle romana rubio romana
sorry
i'm not hearing
can you hear me
thank you ramsey and thank you professor
chomsky
it is an honor and a privilege to talk
to you tonight
in an interview with democracy now a few
years ago
you stated that israel's actions in
palestine are much worse than uh
apartheid in south africa
to call it apartheid is a gift to israel
at least if by upper tide you mean south
african style apartheid you said
what's happening in the occupied
territories is much worse
there is a crucial difference the south
african nationalists needed the black
population that was their workforce the
israeli relationship to the palestinians
in the occupied territories is totally
different they just don't want them they
want them out or at least in prison
so professor chomsky this view was also
communicated by the late south african
anti-apartheid icon archbishop desmond
tutu in 2013.
so could you kindly elaborate on the
comparison uh between the israeli and
the south african apartheid models and
second do you think it is strategic for
palestinians to link their apartheid
anti-apartheid struggle to that of south
africa
and would that comparison
speed up somehow the international
pressure on israel to eventually hold it
accountable
okay small
technical problem the
chat is only
giving the top part but i think i
understand what you were saying
actually yes i've held for a long time
that uh
the occupied territories are
much worse than south africa
it's a gift to israel
to call it apartheid
uh if you look at the
south african situation which was
awful enough south africa
needed its black population it relied on
them
the black population was
85 percent of the population
it was the workforce
country couldn't function
without
that population
and as a result they tried
to make
their situation more or less tolerable
to the international community didn't
succeed but they tried
so the
homelands so called the bantu stands
the
south africa tried to
make them more or less livable
reasonable fairly reasonable conditions
they were hoping for
international recognition
which they didn't get i think israel
was maybe the one exception
but
that's not true of the palestinian
occupied territories
you know israel just wants to get rid of
the people
doesn't want them go somewhere else you
know and its policies for the last
50 years uh not much variation
have been just somehow make life
unlivable so you'll go somewhere else
uh in gaza just destroy them
that's two over two million people now
living in hideous conditions
barely survivable
international organizations
say they're
not likely to even be able to survive in
a couple of years
uh children's a million children there
who can't drink water
no wouldn't no water
to drink uh i don't have to go through
the details you know the
occupied turret the west tank
uh atrocities every day
if you read there are some fine israeli
journalists like guidon levy amira haas
a couple of others
daily reports of one or another atrocity
by
sometimes by settlers
so-called hill hillside youths
terrorists basically
supported by
the army sometimes the army
participating
almost daily uh
just
right now in fact
the supreme court
in an
act of brazen illegality
and a judgment that they
uh produced at midnight presumably
hoping would nobody know it would notice
it
and basically expelled a thousand
villagers from
masayoryato region
kicked them out
under the pretext of establishing a
military zone which is
pure hypocrisy
leaving the jewish settlers there
and as in other cases we just turned
into a jewish settled area perfectly
brazen you know in fact the brazenness
of
israeli actions is
pretty striking
like the uh
after
sharing
abueptic was
very likely just assassinated by israeli
snipers
uh
the idf
attacked a funeral
you saw that everybody saw this on
television attacked the funeral attacked
the pole bearers
uh
eat on levy
wrote a column about it
didn't pull any punches he just said
the israeli storm troopers
attacked the funeral
everybody could see it on television
they didn't care
it was broadcast on
you know main television channels but at
this point they simply don't care do
what they want
the united states will support them
well
all of that is much worse than what
happened in
south africa it's not an effort to
somehow accommodate the palestinian
population as a suppressed workforce
it's just to get rid of them
and in fact if you look at the israeli
plans of the last 50 years
which are unfortunately ignored in much
of the discussion
i should say
as i've said before much of the
discussion of this topic seems to me
misplaced
it's mostly a debate between
two states and one state
that eliminates
the most important option
the live option the one that's being
pursued
namely greater israel
establishing a greater israel in which
israel
takes over whatever it wants in the west
bank
crushes gazan
uh and axes illegally the syrian golan
heights nobody even talks about that
anymore
uh just
takes what it wants
avoids the palestinian population
concentrations so it doesn't incorporate
nobles
and tulcorn
we don't want the palestinians because
of what's called the democrat
so this
pretense that somehow you can have a
democratic jewish state
in which
the state is the
sovereign state of the jewish people
so my state
but not the state of some
palestinian village or in
yates
or in
in israel for that matter
well to maintain that pretense you have
to keep a
large jewish majority then you can
somehow pretend it's
not repressive
but
so the policy is a greater israel
in which you won't have any demographic
problem
the main concentrations of palestinians
are excluded
in other areas they're basically being
expelled
so in the
parts of the west bank that israel
wants to maintain and integrate within
israel
i think there by now about 165
enclaves
in which palestinian villagers are
surrounded with
orb wire
idf soldiers who
occasionally may let them
go out to tend their forms or their
herds or their olive groves
but basically
just go somewhere else let's get rid of
it
that's worse than apartheid
and i think it's
a gift to israel
to describe it as an apartheid state
uh within israel it's not as severe as
apartheid
but outside of israel in the occupied
territories it's considerably worse
i thank you very much for that uh uh
professor chomsky just to stay
uh uh
in the context of south africa
uh in a 2014 democracy now interview you
argued that
the liberation of south africa was an
outcome of both
internal and external reasons for
example the growing isolation
of the apartheid regime and the change
in the
geopolitical scenario
now since the collapse of the soviet
union it seems that our understanding
and discussion
on palestine was largely isolated from
any geopolitical component
and placed squarely within local
dimensions for example the peace process
or regional dimensions for example u.s
foreign policy and arab normalization in
the middle east region now professor
chomsky do you feel
that the geopolitical aspect of the
palestinian struggle for freedom has
changed in recent months especially as a
result of the global rift
itself an outcome of the nato russian
conflict and the war in ukraine
[Music]
there are significant changes taking
place
as a result of the
invasion of
ukraine
uh
basically what happened is
that
there's no first of all it should be
clear there's no justification for the
invasion
it's a criminal invasion it's
on a par with
the u.s invasion of iraq
hitler stalin invasion of poland these
are
examples of the
supreme international crime
you can talk about reasons
provocation
so on
but no justification that part should be
clear
will
what's the background
the main background
is
nato expansion
just briefly run and this is not
my opinion it's the opinion of just
about every
high level
u.s
official
in the diplomatic service who has any
familiarity with uh
russia and eastern europe which goes
back to
george cannon
in the
1990s reagan's ambassador jack matlock
russian expert the 90s
including
the
director of the cia including the
current director of the cia effect just
about everybody who knows it anything
has been warning washington
that it is reckless and provocative
to ignore
russia's very clear and explicit
red lines goes back way before putin has
nothing to do with him
yeltsin gorbachev
the american favorites all said the same
thing
ukraine and georgia
cannot join nato
that's
the geostrategic heartland of the united
st russia
you look at a map
a topographical map you can see exactly
why
look at the history
also see why so that's
out
well what happened
uh george w bush george h.w bush the
first one
i made an explicit unambiguous promise
to gorbachev
that nato would not expand beyond east
germany perfectly explicit
a lot of deceit about it
you can look up the documents it's very
clear
bush lived up to it he didn't violate it
when clinton came along
at first he lived up to it then he
started to violate it and he gave his
reasons
he explained to his friend boris yeltsin
that
he just had to do it for domestic
political reasons he had to get the
polish vote the ethnic vote so
he would let
so-called visigrad countries into nato
russia accepted it didn't like it but
accepted it
his successor ii george bush
just threw the doors wide open
in fact he even
invited ukraine to join
over the objections of just about
everyone in the
top diplomatic service
apart from his own little clique
cheney rumsfeld and those
but
france and germany vetoed it
but it because of u.s power
it remained on the agenda
and in fact starting in 2014
after the mine non-uprising
uh the united states openly
began openly no secret
began moving to
integrate ukraine into the
uh nato military command
sending heavy armaments joint military
exercises
military training and not a secret they
boasted about it in fact
when
in 2019
zelensky was elected
on a peace platform
overwhelming mandate
the peaceman what's called minsk two
uh some kind of autonomy for the eastern
regions he tried to implement it
he was warned by
right-wing militias
that if he persisted they'd kill him
well he didn't get any support from the
united states
if the united states had supported him
he could have continued
we might have avoided all of this
the united states was committed to
integration of ukraine within nato
well
biden came along
last september before the invasion
produced a joint statement
you can read it on the white house
webpage
called for expanding these efforts of
integration
that's part of what was called
an enhanced program
leading to
the mission of nato uh
in november it was
moved
forward to a it's called a charter
signed by the secretary of state
now you go back and go on a couple
months
to the invasion
the united states department
acknowledged openly
that they had not taken
russian security concerns
into consideration in any discussions
with russia
question of nato
admission they would not discuss
well all of that is provocation
not justification
but provocation
and it's kind of interesting that
in american discourse now
it's almost obligatory to refer to the
invasion as the unprovoked invasion of
ukraine
look it up on google you find hundreds
of thousands of hits
well that's a secret way of
acknowledging of course it was provoked
otherwise you wouldn't refer to it all
the time as the unprovoked invasion
so it's not justified but it's provoked
well by now
censorship in the united states
has reached such a level
beyond anything in my lifetime
such a level that you are not permitted
to read the russian position
literally
americans are not allowed to know what
the russians are saying
except selected things
so like if putin makes a
speech
to russians with all kind of uh
outlandish claims about
peter the great and so on
then then you see it on the front pages
uh if
the russians make an offer for
negotiations
can't find it
that's suppressed you're not allowed to
know what they're saying
i've never seen a level of censorship
like this
sort of the same in europe not as
extreme but somewhat similar
uh well
there's a very simple fact that we have
to keep in mind
trivial
truism
the war will end
either through diplomacy
or not
that's just logic
well if diplomacy has a meaning
it means
both sides
can tolerate it
they don't like it but they can tolerate
it they don't get everything they want
they get something that's diplomacy if
you reject diplomacy
you're saying
let's let the war go on
uh with all of its horrors
with all the destruction of ukraine
and let's let it go on until
we get what we want
well what do we want
that's explicit
the united states i'm referring to
what we want u.s is to harm russia
to harm russia
so severely
that it will never be able to
undertake actions like this again
well what does that mean
it's impossible to achieve
so it means
let's continue the war
until ukraine is devastated
that's u.s policy if you stop to think
for 30 seconds
but in the current atmosphere of
irrationality
if you stop to think for 30 seconds
you're a criminal
we got to shut you up we've got to lie
about you as they do regularly in the
media main media
but you're not allowed to talk because
rationality is not permitted
this is a level of hysteria
i have never seen
even during the second world war which
i'm old enough to remember very well
well
net result the u.s continues as before
to block
any form of diplomatic settlement
could there be a diplomatic settlement
we don't know
you can't know unless you try
that's elementary if you refuse to try
can't be a diplomatic settlement
so let's go on
sacrificing ukrainians uh
because uh maybe because it makes us
feel good
or maybe because we think we're noble
and heroic uh we're not
it's nothing noble and heroic about
saying let's kill as many ukrainians as
possible until they get devastated
meanwhile i'm standing up high on
principle
when you look at the people who are
holding up the principle
and shocking
and take the atlantic council the
major international
internationally or oriented organization
that's
leading figures
are standing up very high on
we can't allow russia to get away with
this
nobody's allowed to get away with any
international crimes
the same people
same people or enthusiastic supporters
of the us invasion of iraq
you can't call it hypocrisy
it's beyond any word i know in the
english language
and that's not only accepted but
respected
we've reached a level
of
corruption moral corruption intellectual
corruption
where things like this are actually
respected
well it's pretty clear what they mean
i should say if you want to know the
official u.s position
the most recent exposition of it
was at the
rumstein air base
a couple of weeks ago the u.s called
together the
native powers some others
to meet at the
u.s air base ramstein air base in
germany
where it basically laid down the orders
the orders were
keep fighting until russia is severely
harmed
so much so
that it cannot carry out such acts again
that means
harm russia more than germany was harmed
at the versailles treaty more than that
because that didn't eliminate their
possibility of future aggression
what does that mean
turn russia into an agricultural peasant
country what's it supposed to mean
whatever it means for ukrainians it
means keep dying
because we want to harm russia for our
own reasons
in fact it's sometimes called
the afghan model
referring to the 1980s
where the u.s
essentially tried to
prolong the war
undermine negotiations so as to kill as
many russians as possible
uh the architect of this proposal
zbigniew brzezinski
carter's national security adviser
was asked at the end
did he think it was a successful policy
he said of course it was successful
uh it left he said some
agitated muslims
his phrase
yes there were some agitated muslims but
look how we weakened russia
a million cadavers but
it's just a bunch of agitated muslims
who cares about that
that's carter's national security
advisor
that's called the left in the united
states and not the right
well let's face reality that's the model
that's being proposed
sometimes explicitly like by hillary
clinton
not the right
wing plenty of people in congress
okay so there'll be some
agitated muslims but who cares you know
these time agitated ukrainians
thank you for that uh professor chomsky
if we are if we are to go back to um
palestine the
particularly to the events of may 2021
is this question number four no
this is yes this is question number four
number four
that's right yes
so the events of may 2021 and may
2022 signaled a shift in the nature of
the palestinian struggle
the palestinian people seem to be more
united and more invested in creating a
different superstructure if you will
that is free from factionalism and
political rivalry
part of that change is taking place in
the form of the language that is being
used by resisting palestinian
communities throughout historic
palestine not just the west bank and
gaza
regarding the issue of language
how is it essential
is it as a condition to the creation of
new forms of collective awareness
and new framing of the palestinian
struggle that is free from self-serving
factionalism but one that is also
liberated from the u.s imposed language
that accompanied the oslo accords the
so-called peace process and the
subsequent oslo political culture
just
to make sure were
on the same page
was that question number four
uh yes sir it is question one that's
george the events of may 2021 that's
right yeah that's right it is well
i think that's a very positive change
for one thing one thing that has
severely impeded
the palestinian struggle
is the conflict between
hamas and
the plo
if that's not resolved it's a great gift
to israel
also the split between
the legal
boundaries of israel within its legal
boundaries and the
expanded
area of greater palestine
basically it's a good thing that that's
turning into the same struggle
palestinians are all in it together
actually the
patella
and this international
human rights watch
a description of the whole region
as a region of uh apartheid
though i don't entirely agree with it
for
the reasons i mentioned i think it's not
harsh enough
but nevertheless it's a
step towards recognizing that there's
something crucially in common
uh between
in all this area so i think that's a
positive step
but it should be
taken with clear understanding
of what is happening
we should not be deluded
into thinking
that israel is move is that events are
developing towards
a one-state
outcome
or towards the confederation as it's now
being discussed by some of the israeli
left it's not moving in that direction
that's not even an option
for now israel will never
accept it
as long as it has the option of greater
israel
with no
demographic is going to consider
anything else and furthermore there's no
support for it in the international
community
none
not even the african states
were
jealous of sovereignty they're not going
to support
the elimination of some sovereign state
of anywhere it's not to their interest
they're concerned about their own
sovereignty rightfully
in an area of the after all european
now u.s western colonialism hasn't it
it's alive and well and they know that
uh so they're not going to accept it
certainly europe's not and nobody is so
that's
just a dead end
uh two states well we can talk about it
but
so you have to recognize
that we have to struggle against the
ongoing live option of a greater israel
within that
it's wise
and promising
for palestinians to recognize we're all
in it together
and that includes the diaspora
communities yes it's a common struggle
you go to i mean i've
you know much better than i do but i
visited
refugee camps in lebanon
it's a horrifying experience
you go to uh
even the camps in
beirut which are the better ones like
subrashithila it's not the worst
you see
little children
playing in the dirt
they're never going to see the sunlight
parents invite you into their
homes actually small apartments
and they
lovingly show you the
key to the
village in
galilee from which they were brutally
expelled
hoping
somehow to get back
it's painful
it's very painful to see and much more
painful to live of course lebanon won't
allow them into the society
israel bombs when it feels like or
kills anybody it wants
well that's part of a couple million
people who are a major part of the
palestinian problem
okay so
they shouldn't be together working
together
we should be giving them whatever kind
of help we can give from the outside
and in the united states
the main help we can give them
is
and i think its significant hill is to
change u.s policy
there is now a substantial base of
popular support
for a significant change in u.s policy
even up to
threatening to withdraw all
military and economic aid
which
can will be regarded as illegal under
u.s law that's an opening
okay let's press it
uh many things rest on it
like the iran issue
serious issue
americans wouldn't like it
if they knew
that the threat of global war
over iran is caused by the need to
violate u.s law
to protect
israeli nuclear installations
if americans were no new then they would
like it
uh well okay
let's press on that
on other things like it
i think that can lead to a change and
for people
in my position say in the united states
there's really nothing else to do
except try to publicize make public
what's
the crimes that are going on
in the west bank and gaza even worse
golden heights as well
and the repression in israel
and the horrible situation of the
refugees
can try to make it public but
policy changes could happen
in the united states and that would be
decisive
i thank you if i may bring
my co-host to mana back to the studio
again
yes professor chomsky uh international
solidarity with palestine seems to be
growing too and occasionally the
discussion on palestine even goes
mainstream as a result for example of
mainstream celebrities and well-known
figures expressing their support for the
palestinian struggle and freedom
much of these of course can be
attributed to the determination of the
palestinian people
or a negative to the cruelty of the
israeli occupation but also to the
growing clout of the bds movement
so what is your take on this
and how can palestinians utilize this
international solidarity in their fight
for freedom
despite the fact that they still do not
have a centralized or unified political
message due to the crisis of their
leadership but they have as a people a
vision for liberation as professor ilan
pape and dr ramsey baruch call it in
their latest book our vision for
liberation engaged palestinian leaders
and intellectuals speak out so what is
your take on this on international
solidarity and how palestinians can
utilize it
i'm sorry but i
don't see which question
which is the question five
five
oh question five
okay
well
i don't think mainstream celebrities
matter that much
uh what matters is what's happening
among the general population
in the united states quite different
in israel unfortunately
the population is moving to the right
it's one of the few countries i know
maybe the only one where younger people
are more reactionary than older ones
uh older people have
sometimes some kind of memory of
the
aspirations to be a
somewhat humane maybe even social
democratic society fading a long time
ago younger people have no experience
with it
most young people don't even know
there's a green line
yeah you you have an apartment in
nice apartment in occupied jaffa
you
want to visit your cousin in
malaya do meme
now you drive on a
super highway
for jews and visitors only
you get to the
center of the west bank in malayam you
visit
your cousin who lives in a
very nice suburban highly subsidized
villa
you don't even know there's an arab
anywhere
you're right in the middle of the west
bank you know okay that's
life for a young israeli
so yes of course they're going way to
the right
they feel aggrieved uh liberals don't
like them anymore okay let's turn to the
right
let's make our alliances
with the more reactionary brutal states
and feel the grief
that's israel now
by now
the majority of the population
thinks there shouldn't be any uh
arabs anywhere near the government in
israel
uh well that's happening in the united
states in israel the united states going
the opposite direction
young people are more and more critical
of israel
more and more supportive of palestinian
rights
uh well
the uh
as far as the bds movement is concerned
it
has a mixed record
uh insofar as it's
focused on the occupation
it's very uh productive
when it turns to things like uh
i mean it has a kind of
you know fixed rigid program
and it's the i've dealt with national
liberation movements all my life
this is the first one i've seen
that is so rigid
it cannot discuss
tactical questions
which are the most important questions
what's the effect going to be of this
action
you can't discuss that
because there's a rigid program which we
have to follow
that's often very harmful it's harming
palestinians
it does is
divert attention
away from the problems of palestinians
to side questions
academic freedom
anti-semitism and so on take a look at
the washington post this morning
long article by
one of their liberal columnists on hell
the bds movement is moving to strict
anti-semitism
and it discusses a program of
one group in boston which is
actually poorly designed
but you can't talk about it
because it's rigid
have this program have to stick to it
but what i was talking about before
the lady law it's not in the rigid
formula so they don't do it well missing
opportunities
so that's a mixed story i think has to
become more
flexible
more thoughtful about the effects of
actions
every
solidarity movement understands that
this is the first one i've
ever dealt with
that refuses to talk about it
that's harmful but nevertheless it's
getting through
so the
assassination of
sharian abu flick for example
made it to mainstream television
also the
brazen attack on the funeral
and it caused plenty of outrage
among the general population
it's impossible to suppress
completely what's happening and we can
do more to make it bring it forward and
to leading to
policies that will
change things here
insult true solidarity with the
palestinians
in israel in the occupied territories
in the diaspora
all working together
basically common aims
have to find
the right way to
select policies and tactics that will
advance these aims
the groundwork is there
it's necessary to
think
carefully
about how to carry it forward there's
plenty of barriers
like take for example this
definition of anti-semitism
international i forget what they're
called ihore
it's all over the place well the right
response to that i think
is to applaud it
say yeah it's a great definition of
anti-semitism
using that definition we can instantly
show
that the israeli supreme court
is radically anti-semitic
easy to show that by their definition
one of their
plaques in the program is that people
who identify
try to identify jews all over the world
with the state of israel or anti-semites
okay
supreme court of the of israel uh israel
is unquoting the sovereign state of the
jewish people
prime candidate for anti-semitism
or take the uh
distinguished
statesman abba ebon
greatly
revered because of his nice english
accent and
gentlemanly demeanor and so on
okay
wrote an article 50 years ago
published in
the liberal american jewish journal
jewish congress
congressweekly you can find it
in which he instructed americans
that their task is american jews
addressed to them
said your task is to show
that all criticisms of zionism
are either anti-semitic
if they come from non-jews
are the result of neurotic self-hatred
if they come from jews
so a hundred percent of criticism is
banned
uh because
the jews cannot be distinguished from
support for israel
that's pure anti-semitism
according to the ichira definition
so fine
let's accept the definition and
bring out its consequences
incidentally i should be say that one of
the things i'd like to
mention on my cv that i'm proud of is
that
among the jews with
who criticize israel because of neurotic
jewish self-hatred on one
he mentioned two
me and i have stone
both of us
consumed by uh neurotic guilt feelings
that's why
we criticize this government
okay fine let's bring it to the public
well
uh i think there are lots of things we
can do
we can bring out the
cynicism
pure cynicism
of these
claims of anti-semitism and
take a look at what they actually mean
and the policies that are used to try to
beat people into submission
like say the british labor party or
what's called the labor party has almost
nothing to do with labor anymore
the labor party keith stormer's party
just
extravagantly
celebrated
the
their renewal of relations
with
the israel
reported
tiny diminishing party which is on the
far right
uh
but
it can now be
rejoined with
the labor party stormers party because
uh they got rid of jeremy corbyn
for having to be
semi-reasonable
and to try to
create a labour party that would in fact
respond to its own constituents and
their needs
not supposed to be run by
a right-wing elite in the parliament the
blair-right
softhadgerates
okay
let's bring that out
let's bring out the
historical
lying campaign about anti-semitism
that was wielded to destroy corbin
fine let's talk about it let's expose it
and see what's happening to these
corrupt institutions like
the former labor party
make an old create an alternative change
our own societies
bring this together with the
problem of the palestinians which is
real which we can
help with
lots of opportunities are open
and i think we can
think about them and exploit them
i thank you very much professor chomsky
and i promise this is our last
question i know we have exceeded our
allocated time but this is a very very
important question and we would like to
finish with that so it is it will be
question number six
and the question is
throughout the years
there has been
or there have been many heated debates
regarding the proper solution for
palestine at one point the plo itself
that's back in the 60s
championed a one-state solution only to
abandon it in favor of the two-state
solution and now we are back to the
one-state solution debate
uh now that the two-state solution has
become in many ways defunct
of course there are other solutions that
are often discussed
including for example a rights-based
solution
how do you feel about the issue of
offering solutions at this stage of the
palestinian struggle and does such a
thing
make the discussion purely academic and
intellectual exercise
thus
removed from the fight for liberation in
palestine itself
in an academic seminar
i would be all in favor of
rights-based solutions to everything
to
radical economic and equality
to
the growing threat of nuclear war
to repression in egypt
to
kleptocracy in russia and
go around the world
all in favor of it
has nothing to do with anyone's problems
i would prefer and i think we should
prefer
to focus on what we can do
to help
suffering people
overcome misery
everywhere
that's what we should be focusing on
there's plenty of problems
take afghanistan
according to
the latest u.n report 20 million people
20 million
are facing
imminent starvation
in afghanistan
one major reason
is
the united states has stolen
the money of the afghan government
it's stuck in new york banks
not giving it back to them because we
have to punish them for having thrown
out the united states
that's what it comes they don't say that
of course but that's what it is
the pretexts that are given make it even
worse
the pretext is
that we have to
keep it in new york banks because maybe
americans will
want to be compensated for 911
for which the afghan people had nothing
to do with
but we've got to make sure that
if some american says i want to be
compensated
20 million afghans have to starve
okay let's talk about that and do
something about it because that one's
easy we can release the funds
we can offer them
massive compensation for the destruction
that we carried out against that society
for 20 years
and in fact
going way back to
the lovely afghan trap back in the 1980s
for which we have plenty of
responsibility
to in fact take it with pride as
brzezinski does
uh well that's one case
case of palestine case of yemen
you can go around the world
any number of things we can do
so let's concentrate on that as far as
palestine is concerned same thing
we can talk about a rights-based
solution but there is no possible way to
implement it
so why talk about it i mean yes it's
nice to have in mind it's a nice ideal
peace on earth is a nice idea
let's talk about that
but uh
let's concentrate on what we can do
what we can do begins with the existing
situation
you want to do something
decent in the world you ask what's
happening now
what can i do about it
what are my long-term goals
long-term goals could be a right
a right space solution but what do we do
now to move towards that
well now we're back to where
we i was talking about before
the situation now
is a 50-year
program
still underway
to establish a greater israel
it's perfectly clear
perfectly explicit
travel on the ground
you've done a lot more than i have i
don't have to tell you
but you travel on the ground you see it
you see the
160 or so enclaves
you see the
daily settler attacks i've been in gaza
you see the
misery and violence there regularly
uh
it's it's it's just it's right on the
headlines
messiah yata's right there now
drive a thousand palestinians out of
their homes so jewish settlers can move
in
under the fraudulent pretext of a
military firing zone totally fraudulent
the one that's used all the time
that's what's happening now
let's do something about that
okay
and we can
uh
uh is a two-state solution dead i don't
think so
in fact if u.s policy changes
and the united states insists
that israel withdraw the idf from the
west bank
they're going to have to do it
they have no choice
not just as when
george w bush very strongly pro-israel
when he ordered israel
to stop
programs
with china
upgrading
advanced military equipment
they hated it
that's their main
hope for
economic development
high-tech military china is a huge
market
they said they're never going to stop no
matter what what happens
bush told them you're going to stop
they stopped they've got to don't have
any choices
us tells them
pull the idf out of the west bank
because
incidentally there's no need to withdraw
the settlers
that's a non-issue settlers want to stay
in a palestinian state fine
they're not going to want to
they're going to want to leave 90 of
them 95
they're going to leave their
highly subsidized
pleasant villas in the west bank
move to
highly subsidized
eat some
[Music]
like uh
some
hilltop settler youth from brooklyn
who are gonna stay no matter what okay
let them stay
uh
i don't think of these as really serious
issues it's
a problem but a problem that can be
dealt with
the crucial question is
is the united states going to move to
the point where it will join the world
in fact the entire world
in
supporting a
settlement basically on the green line
with some modifications basic structures
clear it's come pretty close to that
the
taobao negotiations in
january 2001
according to participants on both sides
said that we're coming
fairly close to a possible settlement
when they were cancelled by
ahudbarak cancelled the discussions
maybe
the geneva negotiations afterwards in
informal discussions but
fairly high level they came out with
some
feasible programs
israel
dismissed them wouldn't even talk about
them the united states totally
disregarded them didn't even
mention their existence
that could change
uh professor chomsky we you have been
very kind and generous with your time
and we have exceeded
uh the allocated hour by about 15
minutes we appreciate your patience but
we also appreciate everything that you
have done
uh to raise awareness about the
situation in palestine but many other
uh situations of oppression and human
rights violations around the world thank
you for all of that and thank you for
taking the time to talk to us
i'm gonna bring my uh co-host
romana here as well

sharing it more in the form of a written
feature very very soon thank you very
