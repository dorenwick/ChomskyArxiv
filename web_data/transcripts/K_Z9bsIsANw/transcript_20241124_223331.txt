and
theography citizen of the
century you a
[Music]
citizen name the my name
[Music]
thank
you uh the U topic that was announced is
a large one I can't review it in great
detail but I'll try to give some
indication of how I think it can be uh
productively
explored uh the issues are General but
I'll keep to the United States for
several reasons uh one reason is that
it's obviously the most important case
in the Contemporary world uh a second
reason is that it's an unusually open
Society uniquely so I believe and so we
have a great deal of uh evidence about
the internal
forces that drive planning much more so
than anywhere else that I know of and
thirdly it's simply the most important
case for us for American citizens that's
perfectly obvious but it's plainly true
for Europeans as well uh more than uh
any other area the United States is
influenced considerably by Europe's
stance actually we saw a graphic
indication of that pretty recently when
uh Obama backed away from his plan to
bomb Syria on rather questionable
assumptions uh after the British
Parliament uh withdrew the usual British
support for us
violence so with this in mind let's uh
ask what are the driving forces of
policy in the United States in fact
again in any Global Act but uh the US is
the most important of these by a large
margin there is a receive
version uh it's common to uh academic uh
academic scholarship public discourse uh
diplomatic usage so I'll just quote a
few leading figures to illustrate but
it's quite General so it takes a George
Kennan one of the people who shaped the
modern world according to him government
is created to assure order and Justice
internally and to provide for the common
defense take a leading realist scholar
John mimer the structure of the
International System forces countries
concerned about their security to
compete with each other for power pick a
leading scholar of uh us Middle East
policy William Quan also has long
diplomatic experience he writes that the
driving force of US policy is to ensure
security and well-being of the
population and all therefore agree that
the primary concern since
1945 some say since
1917 has been the Russian threat uh
there are a number of ways to evaluate
the doctrine let's start with the
Russian threat and return to the search
for security uh one obvious question to
ask is what happened when the Russian
threat disappeared in
1989 very clear test of the universal
agreement the answer is everything
continued as
before completely inconsistent with the
standard Doctrine so couple of weeks
after the fall of the Berlin Wall the
United States invaded Panama bombarded
slums killed probably thousands of
people uh poor people we don't care
count our own crime so that's a estimate
stall the client regime uh completely
routine practice in US domains but not
quite routine there was one difference
for the first time it was not justified
by an alleged Russian threat rather
there was a series of fraudulent
pretexts concocted that uh collapse
instantly on
examination uh as usual the media chimed
in
enthusiastically uh lauded the heroic
achievement of defeating
Panama uh it
uh totally unconcerned with the fact
that the pretexts were
ludicrous it was a radical violation of
international
law uh also overlooking the fact that it
was very harshly condemned elsewhere
most most dramatically in Latin America
also ignored was the US veto of a
unanimous Security Council resolution
condemning us crimes carried out troops
carried out by troops during The
Invasion Britain abstained politely all
completely routine all completely
forgotten in the United States and
probably Europe
though not in Panama not surprisingly
which is also
routine well with the Russians gone the
uh the government that was the first
Bush
Administration um quickly issued a new
national security policy and a new
military budget same as before but with
new pretexts so we need a huge military
establishment not to defend ourselves
against the Russians but because of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers uh well-trained
intellectuals are not supposed to laugh
when they hear that and they didn't uh
it's necessary to maintain what they
call the defense industrial base that's
a euphemism for High-Tech industry which
is based on extensive State intervention
in the economy in what's called our free
market economy uh most interesting was
the Middle East the U new strategy said
we have to maintain intervention forces
aimed at the Middle East and Then
followed an interesting phrase where the
serious threats to our interests could
not have been laid at the kremlin's door
so sorry uh we've been lying to you for
50 years but can't do it anymore so we
now have to concede
that the main concern was always and now
explicitly stated what's called radical
nationalism meaning independent
nationalism all of this passed without
any comment but it has quite evident
bearing on the standard Doctrine there
were other important events that took
place immediately after the fall of the
Berlin ball ending the Cold War one of
them was in El Salvador
that was the uh leading recipient of US
military aid it's apart from Israel and
Egypt separate category also had one of
the worst human rights records in the
world that's a familiar
correlation uh immediately after the
Berlin War fell the Salvadoran High
command which is in close contact to the
US Embassy ordered the atlal Brigade uh
to inv the university Jesuit university
and to murder six leading intellectuals
six leading Latin American intellectuals
Jesuit priests uh also to murder anybody
else who might be around so there
wouldn't be any Witnesses so their
housekeeper and her daughter had their
heads blown off too uh the Brigade had
just returned from Advanced Training at
the John F Kennedy School of uh special
Warfare in in the united in North
Carolina uh and already had left a
bloody trail of thousands of the usual
victims in uh the course of the US Run
State Terror campaign in El Salvador one
of a broader one part of a much broader
torture uh Terror campaign throughout
the region all completely routine little
interest very little comment all
forgotten uh here too I presume uh we
can just imagine what had happened what
would have happened if anything remotely
similar would have taken place say in
Czechoslovakia under Russian rule that
tells us quite a lot about the factors
that drive policy and if we're honest
tells us a lot about ourselves as
well another illustrative example is
Cuba uh Cuba gained in Independence in
1959 and for 40 years this is
1989 uh the United States had subjected
it to a murderous terrorist attack it
was particularly extreme during the
Kennedy years and of course a crushing
embargo the pretext was the Russian
threat
1989 no more Russian threat so what
happened the attack on Cuba became
harsher it was spearheaded by by liberal
Democrats in the next election
1992 Clinton outflanked bush from the
right on Cuba that's Cuba actually none
of this would have come as a surprise to
people who paid any attention to the
Declassified record of internal planning
documents from the Kennedy years the
early 60s they made it clear that the
threat of Cuba was what the the
government called successful Defiance of
US policies going back to the Monroe
Doctrine in
1823 the doctrine declared us intention
to dominate the hemisphere and the
Cubans were defying it and worse defying
it successfully so no Russians but the
US intention to dominate the
hemisphere all of this passed without
any impact on the standard Doctrine
actually another important event took
place right away in Europe Soviet
President mik Gorbachev agreed to allow
unification of Germany and its
membership in NATO a hostile military
Alliance in the light of the history of
the century that was a pretty
astonishing concession don't have to
comment on it
but there was a quidd
proquo the pre US president President
Bush Secretary of State James Baker
agreed that NATO would not expand one
inch to the east that was the official
phrase that was referring to East
Germany instantly they expanded NATO to
East Germany gorbachov was naturally
outraged uh but when he complained he
was instructed by Washington that this
was only a verbal promise it was a
gentleman's agreement and if he's stupid
enough to accept a gentleman's agreement
from the United States it's his problem
so it's without force all routine as was
the silent acceptance and approval in
the United States and in fact in Europe
uh Clinton then came into office he
expanded NATO further right along the
Russian border today the world faces
quite a serious crisis that is in no
small measure a result of these policies
all passing without comment well there's
a great deal more that took place uh
after the Cold War ended I think it's
highly revealing uh but instead of
proceeding with that let's turn to a
couple of other ways to evaluate the
standard Doctrine uh one source of
information which is particularly
valuable in the United States because it
is such an open Society is secret
documents that have been released made
public
Declassified they give very revealing
accounts of the actual motives of State
policy that's why they're always
consistently ignored there's no time to
review the matter here but it's worth
mentioning some persistent themes one of
them a major one we find
consistently is that a major Force
driving policy is concerned about what
uh Henry Kissinger called viruses that
spread contagion that's dangerous
Kissinger was referring specifically to
endes Chile which spreen threatened to
spread the contagion of a peaceful
parliamentary path towards IND
independent development and social
welfare uh we know the outcome in that
casee and it's it's duplicated in case
after case throughout Latin America
southeast Asia Africa and the Middle
East always with the same reasoning
can't tolerate viruses if you have a
virus that might spread contagion the
proper reaction is to kill the virus and
uh protect those who might be infected
from contagion that means destroy the
country or its government kill thousand
huge numbers of people and install harsh
brutal military dictatorships all around
the region that's the main pattern of
the Cold War after
1945 well lot more to say about that but
I think that the historical record uh
demonstrates quite clearly that the
standard Doctrine has little Merit and
in fact secur Security in the normal
sense is not a uh prominent factor in
state policy to repeat in the normal
sense but in evaluating the standard
Doctrine about
security uh there's some questions that
we have to ask that are rarely raised
security for whom and uh security from
what malevolent
forces well one answer is security for
state power there are many illustrations
of that let me take an interesting
current one last couple of weeks a
couple of weeks ago the United States
agreed to support a un Security Council
resolution which called on the
international criminal court to
investigate war crimes in Syria but the
US added a Proviso there cannot be any
inquiry into possible war crimes by
Israel War by the United States that's
outlawed as they made clear actually
with regard to the United States it's
redundant the United States has explicit
legislation granting the president the
right to use Force to rescue it's the
term that's used any American who might
be brought to the hag for
trial sometimes called the Netherlands
Invasion act now but it's much more
General the United States is of course
uniquely self- immunized from the
international legal system that's a
prerogative of uh the most powerful
State it's quite an interesting topic no
time to pursue but it illustrates the
importance of protecting the security of
state power well who are the uh dread
enemies from whom the security of state
power must be
protected one prominent enemy is the
domestic
population uh it's always been
understood to be a threatening enemy the
leading public intellectual of the 20th
century in the United
States Walter
Lipman Wilton Wilson Roosevelt liberal
political analyst Progressive Democratic
theorist he explained that policy makers
I'm quoting him and the responsible
intellectuals who cooperate with them
must be protected from the trampling and
the Roar of the bewildered herd that's
the public who are ignorant and
metalsome Outsiders who have to be put
in their place uh that's liberal
democratic theory and liberal
intellectuals quite generally have
agreed in similar terms well to achieve
that end to put The metalsome Outsiders
in their place uh one essential device
of course is
secrecy you take a look at government
secrecy run through internal documents
it rarely very rarely has a genuine
security motivation but it definitely
does serve to keep the population in the
dark in sharp contrast to that the
population cannot be secure from State
power there's a obvious striking current
illustration of that uh the NSA
Revelations of Edward Snowden uh which
are a radical attack on the US
Constitution by uh the Constitutional
lawyer in the white house uh released as
you know by the courageous Fighter for
Freedom Edward Snowden expertly
summarized analyzed in a recent book by
his collaborator Glenn Greenwald very
much worth
reading uh the documents as you know
reveal an assault on basic rights of
quite astonishing scale they're designed
to retrieve every possible bit of
information about every person who falls
within the uh grasp of the Colossus and
that means in principle every person
linked in any way to the modern
electronic Society computer phone
including phones that are turned off or
in any other way uh nothing anywhere
near so ambitious was ever envisioned by
George Orwell or other dystopian
prophets of grim totalitarian worlds
ahead and it's of no slight significance
that the project is being conducted with
enthusiasm and fervor in one of the
freest countries in the world and it is
indeed in quite explicit violation of
the US Constitution the founding
document of American freedom take a look
at the Bill of Rights it protects
citizens from unreasonable search and
seizure it ensures the privacy of their
persons homes papers and effects and
much as Government lawyers may try
there's no way to reconcile these
principles with the assault on the
population that's revealed in the
Snowden documents it's all also well to
remember that defense of these uh
fundamental rights the rights of privacy
were a major factor in sparking the
American Revolution at that time the
Tyrant was the British government which
claimed the right to intrude freely into
personal life now the Tyrant is the
American government uh Britain hasn't
changed it's retained its traditional
tyrannical principles though on a much
more restricted scale given the
relations of power so the British
government approached
Washington the US asking that the US
National Security Agency I'll quote
analyze and retain any British citizens
moob mobile phones and fax numbers
emails and IP addresses anything that's
swept up in the drag net which picks up
essentially everything uh it's also
worth while for Europeans and others to
know that the NSA
routinely receives or intercepts routers
servers other computer network devices
that are being exported from the United
States so that it can implant
surveillance tools and in principle
every keystroke can be sent to President
Obama's huge expanding database in Utah
presumably China does the same at least
tries to uh all of this is justified by
security but it's important to bear in
mind that when a state pleads
security uh that should be disregarded
it carries no information literally The
Plea is completely predictable whatever
the facts so it's
uninformative uh that's true of all
states when they're caught in some crime
or other malfeas and indeed it was true
in this case soon as the Snowden
documents were released the president
and top officials uh stated that uh the
NSA uh Dragnet had stopped 54 terrorist
acts it's pretty
serious uh on inquiry it was reduced to
a dozen terrorist acts uh then a
congressional the Congressional
legislation set up a high level
inquiry access to top level documents
and so on and it found one case one
person had sent $8,500 to
Somalia that's the total yield of this
massive system system and protecting our
security again completely
routine uh there's another concern the
security from private power for private
power and this is some interesting
current illustrations of that which
Europe is involved in there are huge uh
trade agreements being
negotiated transpacific and uh
transatlantic they're called free trade
agreements but they have almost nothing
to do with free trade that's obvious
when you look at them and they're of
course being conducted in secret because
the general population is not supposed
to know about such things actually not
completely in secret they're not secret
to the hundreds of corporate lawyers who
are writing the detailed
proposals uh you can guess what they are
some of them in fact have been leaked
through
Wikileaks the ones that were leaked were
about what's called intellectual
property rights that's a euphemism for
State guaranteed Monopoly pricing rights
designed to ensure enormous profits for
pharmaceutical corporations other
beneficiaries of taxpayer large s and
what are laughably called free
enterprise
economies well there are other examples
to numerous to mention and not at all
surprising uh there a recent study
released by Princeton University by two
leading political scientists Martin
Gillan Benjamin f page They carried out
a careful study of a couple of thousand
policy decisions and the study reveals
I'll quote that economic Elites and
organized groups representing business
interests have substantial independent
impacts on US government policy while
average citizens and mass-based interest
groups have little or no independent uh
influence the results provide
substantial support for theories of
economic Elite
domination fancy term meaning the rich
run the world uh and for theories of
what they call biased pluralism not for
theories of majori majoritarian
electoral democracy or majoritarian
pluralism in other words the United
States doesn't remotely resemble a
democracy it's a
plutocracy there's nothing new about
this this plenty of evidence about it
the same and other political scientists
have shown quite effectively that the
lower 3/4 roughly of the
population lower on the income scale are
essentially
disenfranchised uh the government pays
absolutely no attention to their
opinions one of the reasons they're so
little voting it's kind of sensible uh
it's also been shown mainly by political
Economist Thomas Ferguson major student
of this that campaign spending is a very
good predictor of policy take a look at
who's funding the campaigns You can
predict the policies that goes back to
the 19th century and right up to the
present and again it's nothing new about
a century ago that was a great campaign
manager Mark Hannah the most famous in
American history he was asked what are
the most important things in a political
iCal campaign and he said there are
three the first one is money the second
one is money and I can't think of the
third one that was over hundred years
ago it's much more extreme today but
it's useful to have a uh new and very
careful confirmation of what would be
taught in elementary school in a free
society that includes
Europe uh there's also Le evidence that
security of state power and of
concentrated private power their
security is indeed a driving force in
state
policy uh security from enemies primary
primary among them the domestic
population which is always a potential
dangerous threat to structures of power
and domination and furthermore that's
entirely natural it's to be expected uh
when we look at how policies
formulated uh not quite that simple
there are some interesting cases where
these commitments conflict time to talk
about them but this is a very close
approximation to reality and radically
opposed to the standard Doctrine let's
turn to another question what about
security of the population it's easy to
demonstrate that that's a very marginal
concern of State policy planners so let
me take two current examples of
overwhelming
significance uh global warming and
nuclear weapons any uh literate person
is doubtless aware that these are both
or should be that these are dire threats
to the security of the population so
it's therefore interesting to turn to
State policy and we found find that it
is dedicated to accelerating the thre
threats in both cases in the interests
of the primary concerns enhancement of
state power concentrated private power
that largely determines State policy in
the case of global warming it is so
obvious that I won't even go on to
illustrate it it should know it without
comment and it does illustrate to very
clearly the concern for security is
certainly not for the population
it also illustrates the moral calculus
of contemporary neoliberal State
capitalism uh the fate of our
grandchildren counts as absolutely
nothing in comparison with the need to
make more profit tomorrow that's the
driving principle of what's called
capitalism
today uh it's
[Applause]
it's uh it's interesting to look at how
the propaganda system works in the
United States is a huge uh public
relations campaign it's completely
public nothing secret about it organized
by the business world to try to convince
the public that uh either global warming
isn't happening at all or if it is it
has nothing to do with the human
activity and it's having some impact uh
the United if you take a look at
International polls the United States
ranks somewhat lower than other
countries in public concern about global
warming and indeed the U results are
stratified among Republicans the US
ranks far lower practically as low as
anywhere in the world uh the Republicans
are the party that is most totally
dedicated locks de dedication to private
power and its rights and priv
VES there's a the leading uh there is a
lead the leading Journal of media
criticism in the United States is the
Columbia journalism review Columbia
University its current issue has a very
interesting article on this topic it
attributes this outcome to the media
doctrine of what they call fair and
balanced which means that if a journal
publishes say an opinion piece
reflecting the con inclusions of 97% of
scientists it has to run a counter piece
presenting the claims of the energy
corporations actually that is what
happens and it does lead to confusion on
the part of the population but there
certainly is no doctrine of fair and
balanced so suppose a journal runs a one
of the thousands of opinion pieces
denouncing Putin for the criminal act of
taking over CRI Crimea certainly doesn't
have to run a piece pointing out that
while the ACT is no doubt criminal that
Russia has a far stronger case than the
US does in holding on to Southeastern
Cuba taken over a century ago at
gunpoint includes Cuba's major port
rejecting the demand of Cuba ever since
Independence to turn it back and the
only justification for this is that it
contributes to the uh 50-year program of
terrorist war and economic
strangulation of the country guilty of
successful Defiance of US policy since
1823 and the same is true of quite a few
other current cases uh no need to run
opinion pieces about that uh the actual
media doctrine of fair and balanced
holds for one one case when the concerns
of concentrated private power are
involved nowhere else and though this is
obvious enough it cannot be perceived in
the elite culture in the educated
culture you can verify that very easily
by checking well let's turn to the
threat of instant destruction by nuclear
weapons the record on that is extremely
interesting and it demon demonstrates
quite clearly that from the earliest
days the security of the population has
been a non issue and remain so to the
present the record is shocking and
insufficiently recognized I'd really
urge you to look at it closely strongly
supports the lament of the uh General
Lee Butler he's the last commander of
the Strategic Air Command which controls
nuclear weapons and weapons policy in
his words we have so far survived the
nuclear age by some combination of skill
luck and divine intervention and I
suspect the latter in the greatest
proportion and he goes on to say that we
can hardly count on uh divine
intervention uh as we continue to play
roulette with the fate of the species in
pursuit of the driving factors in state
policy he didn't add that I added it so
take a couple of illustrative examples
beginning at the start of the atomic age
at that time this is
1950 the US was overwhelmingly powerful
enjoyed remarkable security nothing like
it in history controlled the Western
Hemisphere controlled both oceans
controlled the opposite sides of both
oceans had 50% of the world's wealth is
just incomparable power and security
there was however one Potential Threat
potential at that time that was icbms
with uh hydr bomb Warheads they didn't
exist but they might exist someday there
is actually a standard scholarly review
of nuclear policies uh written with
access to high level documents it's by
uh MC George Bundy who was the National
Security adviser for uh the Kennedy and
Johnson uh uh
administrations and what he writes is
that uh he describes the development of
icbms with nuclear warheads as one of
the great achievements of the Eisenhower
Administration but he then adds that uh
it's useful to recognize that both the
United States and the Soviet Union might
be in much less nuclear Danger today if
these missiles had never been developed
and he adds a very instructive comment
he says I am aware of no proposal could
find no proposal in the literature in
either in or out of government that
these missiles should be banned by
agreement nobody even considered it
there was no thought at all of trying to
prevent the sole serious threat to the
United States
threat of utter destruction and this
striking fact merits a phrase in the
standard comprehensive history and has
been ignored in commentary I can't find
anyone who's ever even referred to it
well could it have been prevented would
a treaty have been possible can't be
sure of course but there's some
indication that it would have been
possible one suggestive indication is uh
remarkable proposal by Stalin in
1952 he offered to allow Germany to be
unified with free elections which of
course the Communists would lose but
with a condition that it not join a
hostile military Alliance again hardly
an extreme condition in the light of
History well Stalin's proposal was
received in the United States but it was
ignored or whenever mentioned just
ridicule actually recent scholarship
which now has access to Russian archives
has begun to take quite a different View
and an Illuminating one one case is uh
Adam ulam he's a bitterly anti-communist
Harvard scholar leading specialist on
bolik Russia here's what he
says he says the status of Stalin's
proposal is an unresolved mystery
Washington wasted little effort
in flatly rejecting moscow's initiative
on grounds that were embarrassingly
unconvincing leaving open the basic
question was Stalin genuinely ready to
sacrifice the gdr on the altar of real
democracy with consequences for world
peace and uh real security that would
have been enormous one of the most
prominent Cold War Scholars Vin leer
reviewing Recent research in Soviet
archives writes that Scholars are
surprised to discover that lenti Baria
the Sinister brutal head of the secret
police proposed that the cremin offer
the West a deal on unification and
neutralization of Germany agreeing to
sacrifice the East German Communist
Regime to reduce eastwest tensions and
of course to to improve uh political and
economic conditions in Russia
opportunities he points out that were
squandered in favor of gaining West
German participation in NATO well under
those circumstances it's not at all
impossible that agreements might have
been reached that would have protected
the security of the population from the
gravest imaginable threat total
Destruction but the possibility was not
considered
another striking indication of how
slight a role authentic security plays
in state policy incidentally this tells
us quite a lot about intellectuals in
the United States and Europe try to find
any discussion of this well that was
revealed again in the years that
followed a couple years later Nikita
kchf took office he recognized right
away that Russia could not not compete
militarily with the United States the
richest most powerful country in history
and uh he recognized that if Russia
hoped to escape from its economic
backwardness and of course the
devastating effects of the second world
war it would be necessary to reverse the
arms race so he proposed sharp
reductions in offensive weapons Mutual
reductions uh the incoming Kennedy
Administration considered the offer and
rejected it instead they turned to Rapid
military
expansion the late Kenneth Waltz one of
the leading most respected international
relations Scholars describes it like
this he said the Kennedy administration
undertook the largest strategic and
conventional peacetime military buildup
the world has yet seen as CHF was trying
to carry through a major reduction in
conventional forces and to follow a
strategy of minimum deterrence and we
did so the US did so though the balance
of strategic weapons greatly favored the
United States again a decision to harm
national security security of the
population while enhancing state power
that's Kennedy uh a major reason why
Kennedy B barely squeaked the victory in
1960 was his charge that Eisenhower and
Nixon had permitted the Russians to LEAP
ahead in offensive Weaponry creating
what they called a missile Gap that
severely threatened us security that
frightened the population enough so that
Kennedy barely won the election in
reality the US was far in the lead the
Russians had four operational I
cbm's tiny fraction of the US Arsenal
and this was quickly understood and uh
speaking for the administration MC
George Bundy again he explained that
they had nevertheless been right in
emphasizing a fake missile Gap because
as he put it the phrase had a useful
shorthand effect of calling attention to
our basic military posture that's an
illusion
to the posture of rapidly expanding
overwhelming us dominance and threat and
rejecting security and the prospects for
survival well the Russians did react the
reaction was to place missiles in Cuba
in 19 October
1962 that move was motivated also by
Kennedy's huge terrorist campaign
against Cuba which is mostly suppressed
but this have evidence about it which
was scheduled to lead to invasion in
October
1962 the month when the missiles were in
placed that brought the world to the
most dangerous moment in history uh
Kennedy advisor Arthur Schlesinger's
phrase
historian as the crisis peaked in late
October Kennedy received a secret letter
from chrisf offering to end the crisis
by
simultaneous public withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and US
Jupiter missiles from
Turkey these Jupiter missiles were
obsolete missiles withdrawal order had
already been given for them because they
were being replaced by far more lethal
essentially
invulnerable Polaris submarines the
Kennedy's subjective estimate was that
if he ref refused this offer the
probability of nuclear war was between a
third and a half a war that would have
destroyed the Northern Hemisphere as
President Eisenhower had stated he
refused it's hard to think of a more
horrendous decision in human history and
worse he's praised for his cool courage
and
statesmanship uh 10 years later Henry
Kissinger called a nuclear alert
in the last days of the 1973 Israel Arab
War the purpose was to warn the Russians
not to interfere with his delicate
diplomatic Maneuvers these were designed
to ensure an Israeli Victory but a
limited Victory so that the US would
still be in control of the region
unilaterally and the Maneuvers were
indeed delicate uh the United States and
Russia had jointly imposed a
ceasefire but Kissinger secretly
informed Israel that they could ignore
it and therefore he called a nuclear
alert to frighten the Russians away the
security of the population had its usual
status
zero 10 years after that the Reagan
Administration came in and they decided
to launch operations to probe Russian
defense es the way they did it was by
simulating air and Naval attacks against
Russia and also calling the highest
level nuclear alert which is of course
known to the Russians all of this was
undertaken at a very tense moment
Persian two missiles had were being
deployed in Europe these had a 5minute
flight time to
Moscow Reagan announced the so-called
Star Wars program missile defense which
the Russians understood to be a first
strike weapon that's how missile
defenses understood on all sides for
good reasons and other tensions were
Rising well naturally the Russians were
quite alarmed by this unlike the United
States Russia is quite vulnerable had
repeatedly been invaded almost
destroyed uh and uh that led to a major
war War scare in
1983 there are newly released archives
that reveal that the danger was much
more severe than historians had
previously assumed there's a CIA study
that just appeared it's called the war
scare was for real they conclude that
CIA concludes that the US underestimated
Russian concerns and the threat of a
Russian reaction the major journal on
this topic Journal of strategic studies
it writes that these Reagan exercises
almost became a pre Prelude to a
preventive Nuclear Strike which would
have wiped out the Northern Hemisphere
and in fact it was more dangerous than
that we learned last September there was
it was revealed that right in the midst
of these world-threatening
developments Russia's automated early
Warning Systems detected an incoming
missile strike from the United States
sending the highest level alert while
the protocol for the Soviet military
like the American Military is to
retaliate at once with a nuclear attack
of its own now there was an officer on
duty stanislav Petro he decided to
disobey the orders and not to report the
warning to his
superiors and thanks to his dereliction
of Duty we're alive to talk about it
that was
1983
uh and
uh you can determine how much publicity
has been given to all of this well
security for the population was no more
a priority for the Reagan planners for
their and for their predecessors and
that continues right to the present
in fact
uh pretty obvious when you take a look
at what's going on in Ukraine and plans
for the future are even more
frightening uh Obama came into office
with nice rhetoric about cutting back
the arms race in fact he's exceeding his
predecessor George Bush in expanding the
nuclear weapons Arsenal United States
under Obama is now planning to spend
more than a trillion dollars on the
nuclear Arsenal in the next 30 Years and
of course the United States is not alone
though it's in the lead so going back to
General Butler it's a near miracle that
we've escaped destruction so far and the
longer we tempt fate the less likely it
is uh that we can hope for divine
intervention to rescue us from our
Folly well we're all surely aware just
to conclude that we now face the most
ominous decisions in human history there
are lots of problems that should be
addressed but two of them are
overwhelming in their significance
environmental destruction nuclear war
for the first time in history we Face
the prospects of destroying the
possibility of decent existence and not
in the distant future and for this
reason alone it's imperative to sweep
away the ideological clouds face
honestly and realistically the question
of how policy decisions are made and
what we can do to alter them before it's
too late thanks
