I
just briefly what's irrationality and
then conversely what's rationality Oh
perfect example of extreme rationality
is what we've just been talking about
what Orwell called double-neck the
ability to have two contradictory ideas
in your mind at the same time and
believe both of them that's the peak of
irrationality and that virtually defines
the elite intellectual community okay so
that's a rationality now let's take
concrete examples of fundamentalist
irrationality so I'll give you a real
example I teach an example I knew about
about five years ago but I didn't
publish it because I sounded so crazy it
couldn't be true turns out to be true
it's now verified in the January 2003
immediately before the invasion of Iraq
George Bush was trying to round up the
international support for the invasion
and he met the French president
president sheer act and in this meeting
with chiraq he started ranting about a
passage from ezekiel book of ezekiel a
very obscure passage nobody understands
it's a passage about Gogan Magog nobody
knows if their people are places or
whatever they are as but Goguen mago are
supposed to come from the north and you
know attack Israel and then we get off
into ultra fanatic at Christian
evangelical madness there's a whole big
story about how Coogan mago
down tech Israel there's a battle in
Armageddon
everybody gets slaughtered and the souls
were saved rise to heaven okay some kind
of story like that
Reagan apparently believed when his
handlers didn't control him enough it
was kind of off by himself he'd started
raving about this and for him go then
Mugabe Russia for Bush dog and Magog
where Iraq so he told this to Iraq and
sure I cannot clue what he was talking
about so he approached the French
Foreign Office the Alizee and said you
know what this madman is raving about
and they didn't know either so they
approached a Belgian very well-known
Belgian theologian who wrote a sort of a
disposition on this passage and the way
it's interpreted and what am I mean and
so on okay how do I know well I know
because that Belgian theologian and his
foreign sent me a copy of it with the
background the story I never published
it because this just sounded too off the
wall finally I gave some to an
Australian academic researcher and I
mentioned it to him he decided to look
into it
it turns out to be correct in fact the
story appears in the biographies of
sheer act and in other isms so yeah that
actually happened so here's the world in
the hands of a raving lunatic who you
know it's talking about
Goggan mago than armageddon and the
souls rising to heaven and you know the
world survived well ok that's that's not
a small thing in the United States I
don't know the percentages but it's
maybe 25 30 % of the population that's
pretty serious irrationality ok science
then what science I mean why is
something scientific what marks
something as being sensible science or
nonsensical non science masquerading etc
on the one hand and some
you're going to answer fully how do you
feel about left criticisms of science
leftist who criticize science is being
you know whatever they say it's Imperial
or it's sexist or it's rooted in Western
whatever that's on well you know like
anything that we understand about at all
with regard to things as complicated as
human affairs the answers are pretty
trivial if they're not trivial we don't
understand it there is category
intellectuals who are undoubtedly
perfectly sincere who who if you look at
it from the outside what they're
actually doing is using poetic words and
complicated constructions which
apparently they seem to understand
because they talk to each other most of
the time I can't understand what they
keep talking about and you know the
people are supposed to be in my field
and it's over inflated and the lot of
prestige and so on as a terrible effect
in the third world in the first world
rich countries didn't really matter that
much so if a lot of nonsense goes on in
the Paris cafes or the comparative
learish department one okay on the other
hand in the third world popular
movements really need serious
intellectuals to participate and if
they're all ranting of postmodern
absurdities well they're gone I mean
I've seen real examples but give them to
you but so there is that category and
it's considered very left-wing and very
advanced and so on and so forth well
some of what appears in it actually
makes sense but when you reproduce it in
mono syllables it turns out to be true
isms so yes it is perfectly true that if
you look at scientists in the West
they're mostly men it's perfectly true
that women who had a hard time breaking
into the scientific fields and it's
perfectly true that there are
institutional factors determining how
science proceeds
that reflect power structures I mean all
of this can be described literally in
mono syllables and it turns out to be
true isms when you give you okay on the
other hand you don't get to be a
respected intellectual by presenting
truisms and mono syllables now a lot of
the left criticism so when the left
so-called left person considered left
when the left criticism so called
happens to be accurate
okay that's fine so if you point out a
lot of things just like what I mentioned
there are a lot of no that's fine point
it out you know everybody understand it
you take a look you see it's true and so
on and it had a lot of holes so-called
left criticisms needs from pure nonsense
in fact that's been demonstrated
conclusively so there's a very important
book by Jean Buerkle and Alan SoCal
forget what it's called dangerous
illusions or something where they simply
go through the they happen to
concentrate on Paris which is the center
of the rot but it's all over and they go
through the most respected French
intellectuals and run through what they
say about science and you know it is so
embarrassing that you kind of cringe
when you read it actually sometime one
of my famous triking ones is one of the
very few actually is a scientist and
knows something about science
let tor as a background in science and
philosophy of science they go through an
article of his and I think I'm
remembering correctly in which he he's
somebody in France that somewhere had
discovered that one of the pharaohs had
died of tuberculosis and they did it by
you know analysis of whatever DNA or
something look to her wrote an article
ridiculing this this is totally absurd
because because he had welcomed that
tuberculosis is only discovered in the
19th century I could and everything's a
social construction and therefore it
wasn't constructed yet so yes so it
didn't happen I mean you know it's kind
of at the level of Bush and Chirac but
but it's taken very seriously and this
is considered very left
but one point to look at I think is that
the description of intellectuals the
description of journalists and now the
description of this sector a part of
what calls itself the left you have
something similar going on even though
the price is much lower you have those
guys sitting in the air-conditioned
rooms bombing the hell out of the world
for their careers for their for their
status because of their reflexive
lessons that they've learned and then
over here you have people who are in
literary criticism or whatever feel they
might be in who are also completely
divorced from reality or obscuring it or
darling it up for similar reasons of
course the price is much less I mean
it's high but it's there yeah but it's
still rich countries it's just dependent
it's still not like that bombing the
world yeah but it's the same phenomenon
they're hard to understand I mean if you
they're nice people a lot of my friends
if you look at what's happening I think
it's it's pretty easy to figure out
what's going on I mean suppose you're a
litter literary scholar the elite
university or you know anthropologist or
whatever I mean if you do your work
seriously that's fine you know but it's
not very I mean you don't get it prizes
for it
on the other hand you take a look over
in the rest of the university and you
got these guys in the physics department
and the math department and they have
all kind of complicated theories which
of course we can't understand but they
seem to understand them and they have no
principles and they deduce complicated
things for the principles and they do
experiments and you know they've find
either they work or their homework and
so and that's really you know impressive
stuff so I want to be like that too so I
want to have a theory in literary and in
the humanities you know Larry criticism
through Paula G and so on there's a
field called theory we're just like the
physicists they talk in
really we can talk incomprehensibly they
have big words we'll have big words they
draw you know far-reaching conclusions
will draw for each and conclusions we're
just as prestigious as they are now if
they say well look we're doing real
science and you guys aren't that's a
white male sexist the you know whatever
the answer is how are we any different
from them
okay that's appealing there are other
things that went on remember that a lot
of this stuff comes from Paris and
interesting things were happening in
Paris in the 1970s the French
intellectuals were the last group of
intellectuals in the world who were
dedicating Li not 100% but it was very
standard and respected to be a dedicated
Stalinist and Maoist not ever the mid
seventies I was getting to be a pretty
hard position to uphold so what you had
if you take a look at what happened is
there was a sudden shift people who had
been flaming Maoists and Stalinists
suddenly became the first people in the
world to have discovered the gulag and
went on a tear about how everyone else
supports you know Stalinist and Maoist
atrocities and we're France of course
that we have to be in front of everyone
so therefore we've exposed it and now
we're open it's what's called the new
philosophy or a new philosophy or
something and it went over all kyra
member meeting I won't mention names
because is embarrassing one of the
leading French cultural theorists who
happened to visit me around 1974 and she
was a flaming Maoist a couple of years
later she was one of the first people
who understood to have you know
discovered the smallest and Maoist
atrocities well ok when he went through
that transition you got to do something
else how you going to be you know on the
front pages ok
comes along becomes the invention of
post-structuralism
all right what about religion what what
do you think religion is flensing it's
virtually depending what you mean by
religion I mean if you believe if you
mean the Abrahamic religions you know
we're a week round here because of
course I'm religiously illiterate but
that Judaism Christianity and so well no
I mean I guess yeah and and the other
such religions of a type is what are
those Buddhism is different spiritual
beliefs among Native Americans was
different for me there's all kind of
religion distinction that we're talking
about there the we're talking about the
Abrahamic energy no follows okay that's
just it
yeah that's the green do I guess none of
Hindus are different that's a quite
different that Buddhism is quite
different I mean if you really look at
these systems of belief they differ a
lot in fact no but what I'm asking is
what is religion per se now what some
beliefs are some to come over they
belief that there's something in the
world which is beyond my grasp which is
determining the way things happen and
it's going to you know it'll be a
consolation for me maybe you know if my
child is dying I'll see him again in
heaven somewhere I mean these kinds of
beliefs and that there's a sort of a
spiritual force somewhere beyond my
grasp and that explains why things are
happening that's probably a Bic with us
it's perfectly understandable yeah I
mean you know the weird things are
happening like the Sun is moving around
the earth you can see it I don't have
that happening but you see it well
something must be making it happen okay
so it's Apollo is chariot pulling the
Sun and the same with everything else
goes on you don't understand anything
that's happening in the world in
personal life and you know why are why
is my child
sweet little wonderful kid dying into
anything so there's got to be some
explanation somewhere so it's a stead of
stories to make sense of reality except
not science
I mean Apollo
pulling the Sun with the chariot
anything it's early science it's a kind
of a scientific theory and I was know it
worked out and it was not not trivial
like you know for example the classical
Greeks and discover a lot of things but
if you say it now if you say when
there's lots of evidence other than that
then it's no longer science if you know
that just means that our understanding
is deepened right but you know the
transition from magic to science is a
pretty smooth transition and it just I
mean even the word the word science in
English didn't even appear until the mid
19th 19th century I mean there was a
word that meant something else just
meant knowledge in the nineteen mid
nineteenth century there was a divorce
between science and philosophy before it
was just philosophy in fact if you study
if you go to Oxford let's say you can
study natural philosophy and moral
philosophy natural philosophy is what we
here call the natural sciences moral
philosophy is what we call the
humanities but through a German it's the
same thing so the whole concept of
science in our sense is a pretty recent
one and it's it began and that there was
a an intellectual revolution you know so
it begins with Galileo goes on and it
led to enormous insights and after a
while science just kind of took off and
he gave a special domain we've in the
early 19th century it was that takes a
Conte
he couldn't have told you where there
was a philosopher or scientist he taught
astronomy I mean he thought the moral
philosophy and yeah
an intelligent educated gentleman did
all those things well by the mid 19th
century is becoming very hard to do all
those things the sciences were reaching
a point where you really understand
things and you couldn't be a gentleman
who knows everything so okay things got
professionalized and we get you know
what we call science separate domain but
recall how recent this is a prior to
that people were trying to figure things
out and we might now call what they're
trying to figure out the magic but these
are pretty smart people it takes a Isaac
Newton they're not a fool exactly
I mean he's now kind of people laugh
about the fact that he was spent most
his life working on chemistry and church
fathers but I was alchemy in church
fathers
I was probably reasonable I mean in
terms of the work all corpuscular Aryan
theories that everybody accepted the
world is made up a little building
blocks like bricks as if nephew
yeah shift a few and you get the gold
from lead it makes perfect sense that's
where the church fathers that made
perfect sense to I mean he was coming
right after the humanist period when
there had been a sudden discovery of the
wealth and richness of classical
civilizations which hadn't been known so
the belief expanded that these guys
really understood something and they
were kind of keeping it secret for us so
they're doing it in esoteric way and if
we in decode what they were doing we'll
get all kind of wonderful discoveries so
it wasn't an irrational pursuit and this
not that long ago this is the 17th
century this is Isaac Newton isn't in my
lifetime it well ok so so when you come
closer to the present and you have some
things about religion that have been
painful and caused suffering and very
harm and other things about religion
that have been pretty exemplary and that
have contributed to justice should we
take let's say take liberation theology
that was that was a revival of early
Christianity and it was so threatening
to the United States that the u.s.
launched a war against it I want to
switch to a political variant of some of
the things we've been talking about
which is the term called sectarianism a
lot well sometimes it's genuine
disagreements which should be worked out
you know you know with solidarity mutual
sympathy and support and so and I've
we've all been in activist groups and
goes on and on you have long meetings
with the real issues to discuss
so that's
so in phenomena that's the right kind of
the right kind of if you like
sectarianism a lot of its ego driven you
know I want to be Lana so you follow me
and there's a lot of that I've got my
doctrines and ideology and if you don't
accept them you're an enemy of you know
the working people or whatever it
happens to be as extremely compact
common among groups that are the have
don't have much mass support you know
that are kind of isolated they don't
that don't either don't have a lot to do
or like to believe that they don't have
a lot to do and sectarianism is one of
the ways of avoiding engagement we don't
have to give example so I mean it's
rampant a lot of it's pretty ugly but
it's not only the behavior there's
something about it seems to me holding a
few points in a sectarian fashion sort
of like holding a viewpoint in a
fundamentalist sash and has this element
of it's true because it's doctrine it's
true because it's in a book it's true
because I believe it or because somebody
else who I admire believes it and it's
on its unchallengeable it's just the way
it is that's what that kind of
sectarianism of course kind of destroy
groups if I get a decent government
infiltrator and there are plenty of them
I would want to stimulate that kind of
sectarianism we've all seen it happen
for I tell you remember say in the 60s
one of the things that every group had
to learn often the hard way is that even
among your small circle there's a
provocateur and the pastor awhile it got
to be sort of possible to pick them out
they were the ones we're going to show
up at the trials and you know that sort
of thing but if pretty soon people got
to know that if there's someone in the
group who's dressed like a Hollywood
version of a hippie and who's saying you
know stop this nonsense let's go out and
kill the cops and so on and so forth
chances are he's a
Proctor sometimes doesn't have to be
going for rocket or a lot of these small
groups are parasitic on popular
movements and they try to recruit you
know they join they work they sit around
the meetings longer than anyone else the
you know get in a position of some kind
of control and then recruit it to their
own particular sect that goes on all the
time and it's very disruptive to popular
movements and I'm talking about of
course but I'm talking about good people
who have historically you know having
their live it's been perfectly sensible
people who for whatever reasons become
sectarian meaning they adopt a set of
views and are no longer open are no
longer open to the possibility that
those views could be wrong that any
evidence could be contrary to those
views they no longer can see the world
except in terms of those views that's
sort of what I mean by a sectarianism
where it's not because they're trying to
they're not police you know they're not
just it's just but that's part of life
you know I mean you have it in the most
dense scientists so it takes a Einstein
I use that example often he just
wouldn't believe that as he put it God
could throw dice with don't worry about
behaving in that fashion get in that
kind of tree yourself sure anybody
sensible okay what originally and you
should do it put sometimes you really do
believe you're right and you should
pursue it so but what's the personal
antidote to the rampant phenomenon for
an individual man is just to try to be
as open minded and sympathetic others as
you can it's not easy and the
controversial complicated situations are
even in the hard sciences I mean I find
it all the time and just in professional
work okay you sort of try to deal with
it somehow and the structural antidote
imagine your I don't think there is in
general there isn't one because it's a
good thing I mean I don't criticize
Feinstein for having not willing to
believe
one of theoretical brooches and in fact
as you know way better than I do a lot
of good experimental proposals came out
of that you know like was it cool good
quantum you know the things too far
apart to communicate that there oh the
name for that if you lose that came out
of an experimental proposal than
Einstein and a couple others made but so
there's nothing wrong with it and that's
the way human behavior ought to be I may
can get to the point where it's it
becomes a personal ego trip
it becomes an effort to take over and
control but these are just aspects of
human life that you have to do with it
could happen in a family you know yes
there's no there's no general answer
there is this creationism phenomenon
which bears on science also what has
been your reaction a lot of it comes
from a religious source I'm eating at
people and a lot of it's really genuine
you know people do not want to accept
the idea that what they interpret as
meaning everything is determined it
doesn't mean science doesn't mean that
but that's if you have a superficial
understanding of science and in fact
even if you read what plenty of
scientists and philosophers say it's
basically saying look you don't have any
free will you don't know any choices
everything is determined it's all you're
just kind of acting out something in a
system of controls and you'll name do it
yeah I don't want to believe that in
fact don't and I can easily see why
other people don't want to believe it
they want to believe that there's
something good going on in the world
maybe I can't grasp it but there's a
force somewhere that is trying to make
us better make the world better make
good things happen and bad things not
happen and it's just that also just for
personal reasons to go back to the
mother of the dying children child you
know I want to see my child again
someday so I'd like to believe it
well you know one consequence of this
array of beliefs is to think that the
world was created and that's for common
I mean founding fathers for example who
did want to separate church and state
we're mostly were called theists the
idea was that God something that was
even said this way God is a retired
engineer he got the whole thing started
gave it a kick in the pants and then he
left and you guys are supposed to run it
well that was you know kind of like sort
of a secular religion that was common at
the time but at the same time the US has
citizens has been kind of off the
spectrum and religious with an extremist
religious beliefs I mean if you do other
our comparative studies and you know
belief in the United States belief in
miracles in the devil the world was
created 10,000 years ago and so on it's
just off the spectrum you don't find
that and some extent you find in other
industrial societies like in England you
find ins
but the United States is literally off
the graph and this goes back to its
origins I mean the country was founded
by religious extremists people who
founded you know the new English
settlers of New England we're following
God's will there's a streak in US
history which called providential ISM
very dominant streak goes all the way
from fentanyl founding fathers are
called up to the current presidents and
Zula God has a conception of history now
we're acting it out and some of the ways
in which this was applied are pretty
remarkable so for example the core of it
takes a the English settlers in New
England Mayflower and all that stuff
they the first charter of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony given by the
king and Charles was I think 1628 and
the goal of the mess
colony was to bring the benefits of
civilization including the Christian
religion to the Indians who were
pleading for it we're doing them a favor
in fact if you look at the Great Seal of
the Massachusetts Bay Colony sixth-round
1629 you know they had a seal it's very
revealing it ought to be on a clip in
the world every classroom in the country
what it shows it's the founding of the
country what it shows is an Indian with
Spears pointed down signs peace and out
of the Indians mouth is a scroll and the
scroll says come over and help us so the
colonists were carrying out what is now
called the responsibility to protect you
no fancy term for imperialism that's
common so they were carrying out the
responsibilities to protect they were
totally selfless they were coming over
just to answer the plea of the
indigenous population to come over and
help us
that's the time when the famous phrase
city on a hill was produced 1630 John
Winthrop gave a famous statement is that
we're a city on the hill you know we're
not like any other country in the world
we're benevolent to selfless coming over
to answer the plea of the Indians to
help us that goes right until today
that's a leading theme of scholarship
that we're different and journalism of
course that we're just different from
everyone else because we're a city on a
hill shining city on the hill is where I
even put it it's right to this minute
and the reason it comes from our
answering the plea of the natives to
help them well in fact they exterminated
them and that was explained to you take
a look at you know leading Supreme Court
justices commentators others they say
well you know it's the ways of God or
mysterious although we came to help the
Indians and we tried you know everything
we did was in their interest somehow
they withered away you know
that's the phrase that was used they
just like the leaves and autumn they
kind of blew away and this goes right on
to the present I mean it you know
towards the end of the century like say
early 20th century of me it was pretty
hard to go on with this so you get
people like Theodore Roosevelt one of
the most extreme racist murderers in the
American history that's why he's on
Mount Rushmore
he explained - he was during the second
term of his presidency must have been
maybe nineteen six or seven uh no when
exactly he gave it talk to a group of
missionaries in which he explained to
them that it was for the benefit of the
native population that we exterminated
them litter as almost as words he said
because it enabled a superior race to
replace them and that was very common
when you read things like that and what
Whitman Ralph Waldo Emerson I mean the
great heroes extremely racist country
and they invented a mythology of
anglo-saxon ISM were all anglo-saxons
you know like doing me where
anglo-saxons
Jefferson for example it was a big
believer in this said we've got to go
back to like I know the eighth century
or something when there were pure
anglo-saxons before they were
contaminated by others and that's the
ideal of humanity justice and everything
this one's Benjamin Franklin for example
so they thought that we should they're
first he thermistor got their first of a
massive Franklin thought that we
shouldn't allow integration of Germans
and Swedes because they're not wait
enough they're kind of a little off
color but we the pure anglo-saxons just
carry civilization Floreen is it goes
it's incredible the history of it I
won't go through it but the Hitler looks
mild in comparison and this goes right
through the nun fact Hitler didn't kind
of use this as a model it goes right
through American history goes right into
today it's part of the American
exceptionalism will saw an idealism you
know it very racist and it's just all
over okay well these the one aspect of
these beliefs is just you know what most
of the world would call religious
extremism so that we're what we're
called great we await reawakening 's in
American history periods of sort of mass
enthusiasm because you know Christ is
coming or whatever it may be and it's
all over the place you know it just
keeps recurring there's a big one in the
1950s and you get it's it's changed in
the last thirty years in an interesting
way now this has been right through
American history but it was never it
never really entered the core of the
political system there were you know it
was it influenced things but there's a
big change I think it comes from Jimmy
Collins Evans studied but my impression
is it comes from Jimmy Carter Jimmy
Carter was a an honest sincere you know
fundamentalist Christian probably
believed everything he was saying you
know kind of like an honest simple guy
and so all this business you know which
most of the world considers kind of like
off the wall he believed and I think
party managed and American elections are
essentially run by the PR industry and
party managers got an idea I think I
can't prove it but see what happened is
this the party managers recognized that
if you pretend to be you know a devout
Christian you pick up like thirty
percent of the vote and in fact every
presidential candidate since Carter has
professed to be devout Christian you
know it takes a Bill Clinton for always
about as religious as I am his handlers
made sure that every Monday morning
there was a photograph of him and
about this church or whatever it is you
know singing hymns and so on and so
forth I mean that's a way in which you
sort of pick up a segment of the
population and I don't think there's a
single exception since Carter integrity
and honesty and everything else goes
down the drain of course as a habitual
obstacle that it's appealing to
something that's pretty deep in American
culture including you know its
Intermountain intertwined with racism
with you know anglo-saxon fanaticism
with come over and help us you know you
find it's just a big strain in the
culture
you've been very skeptical of what are
called conspiracy theories popular
conspiracy theories from County
assassination through 9/11 so not
dealing with those specific theories but
more with the general issue what advice
would you give to people who are trying
to figure out one elites are in fact
Spira Singh conspiring and when the view
that they are doing that is really just
a cultish conspiracy theory so to say
take the second world war
okay that's we're not talking about the
Roosevelt administration you know most
liberal administration ever from 1939 to
1945 there were meetings taking place I
mean these people have brains there were
meetings taking place of high-level
State Department planners and the
Council on Foreign Relations which is
kind of like the out of government
closest organization of business people
others who are kind of have interests in
foreign policy it's not a secret
organization it was a lot of conspiracy
theories about it but it's quite open
and they they were meeting regularly
they had something called the war peace
studies group in which they were
planning for the post-war world makes
good sense I mean it was that they were
conspiring to figure out what to do in
the post-war world
everybody yeah it is the word of General
Motors is conspiring it's a conspire
it's a conspiracy they're working
together top-level planners to decide
how to run the world and what they say
it is extremely interesting
in fact they laid out principles which
are quite interesting which are still
carried out they're still the guiding
principles they were implemented in the
early post-war world their proposals are
almost the same as those that the
government developed in the late forties
okay that's a real conspiracy theory now
there in fact is one book about it by
Larry Shoop and William mentor
it's called imperial brain trust okay
the phrase is okay they should have
given it a different title because it
gives the mainstream an easy way to just
disregard it it's very accurate it just
coats the documents it's virtually
unmentionable and the people on the Left
who are looking for conspiracy theories
never mention it it's a that's a
conspiracy an open conspiracy which had
lots of consequences it still does or
take say the I mean there are some
technical conspiracies like where people
go to jail for conspiracy one of them
has enormous influence and should be
better known I mean in the 1940s General
Motors is Firestone and Standard Oil of
California conspired to buy up and
destroy the very efficient electric
railway systems in Los Angeles and many
other places and convert it all to use
of fossil fuels you know trucks cars and
so on well you know that was one part of
a huge social engineering project the
government and others to his
corporations which just changed the
country change the country to something
which may destroy the species we're now
living with it the wasteful use of
fossil fuels was purposeful they were
taken to court they were sent
they got a fine I think $5,000 or
something like that those are real
conspiracy and one with enormous
consequences and there are many more
life is difference in kind between that
and what people are referring to when
they're talking about conspiracy
theories what's the difference in kind
one difference is these are real they're
real major conspiracies which have huge
consequences but what a lot of people
are looking for some it's kind of a
little bit like the people who listen to
Rush Limbaugh they want an answer you
know the world is rotten must be
something going on that we don't know
about and if we could only ferret it out
you know that would tell us why the
world is rotten actually the reason is
right in front of your eyes and there's
plenty of evidence about it but that's
not exciting enough so we want a believe
take say the kennedy conspiracy theories
i'm is only one interesting question
that i know of about the kennedy
assassination
namely was it a high level of conspiracy
with policy consequences if it wasn't
then unless you worship royalty i don't
see why it's different from the last
killing in Roxbury
you know yeah you don't want so he be
killed but the conspiracy theorists that
good trans and smelly who think I'm you
know really think I'm kind of like a
major criminal for this they're devoted
something else they want to show that
there was a high-level conspiracy which
took away from us this magnificent
person who was going to do all sorts of
terrific things you know and make it a
better world and it's because they
killed him that we got into the awful
mess that we're in well you know there
are ways of investigating then you can
look at Kennedy's policies you can look
at his statements you can look at his
actions you can look at what followed
when exactly his advisors same people
including the doves continue don't made
the decisions you can see that you know
he was one of the hawkish members
towards the sort of hawkish side of his
administration he was dragged kind of
her
Bentley and a little support for civil
rights and a few other things
now he's carrying out the terror wars
against Cuba right to the day of the
assassination and on and on and
furthermore nothing changed I mean what
changed with the same advisors the ones
that were giving even the ones who are
advising them on withdrawal you know
it's good idea they did change their
positions because the facts changed but
there's no indication and there's the
slightest particle of evidence of any
high-level conspiracy so therefore you
look for something else you know the CIA
didn't like him for the set and the
other reason and there's a huge industry
about that and of course you know and
all these things you'd put piles of
factoids together you know if you have
no conception of what a theory and an
explanation is remember most people
outside the sciences don't what you do
is collect factoids you know this
happened that happened that he explained
that I explained this I mean if you were
to look at scientific experiments that
way you could disprove all science
that's one of the reasons why scientists
do experiments of instead of taking
videotapes of what's happening out the
windows you take videotapes yeah why did
that thing we were there I don't see any
reason for you know it's so obviously
somebody's pushing okay these elementary
facts understanding is mostly gone
outside of the sciences some of the
reasons why I think you know any
educational system people ought to study
something about the sciences just so you
learn what an argument is you know from
then you see what an explanation is but
for most of education that's going so
they're trying to put some together any
of these very elaborate schemes and
systems there's no evidence for them but
you got to believe like it's it's not
that i displace them like maybe the
truth may be the right maybe it was the
CIA maybe it was the Mafia maybe it was
this maybe was that who cares you know
it has essentially no significance
unless you believe that in the Camelot
story that Kennedy was just about to do
the most magnificent things and that's
why I was killed but then you have to
have some evidence for that and when you
look at those stories they're extremely
interesting even really good people I
could list them good historians
the kind of evidence they give is kind
of shocking the main idea is well
Kennedy was kind of a Machiavellian he
had these plans in his mind to do all
kind of wonderful things but he had to
conceal them from his advisors because
they would have blocked them so he
therefore said you know we can't get out
of Vietnam before victory but that was
in order to delude McNamara and other
people so they wouldn't know that he
really was going to get out you know and
it goes on like this I mean it's all
just worship of royalty you know it's
that which is kind of nice you know you
feel something magnificent was happening
and the Camelot story is a very easy one
to believe in because Kennedy was no
fool
he knew he understood right away you
want to get a good press and you know
good record butter up the intellectuals
make him think you love them and he did
you know he you're little too young to
remember but in the early 60s in
Cambridge yeah every morning on the
eastern shuttle Harvard and MIT
professors were flying down to
Washington to have lunch with Jackie and
to say hello to Jack clock the Dean and
all that kinda stuff and coming back in
the evening just glowing with joy at how
they were rubbing shoulders with royalty
and they were treating him nicely
probably making fun of them when they
left but and they got a very good got a
very good image you know that's where
the Camelot story comes from but if you
try to look at the facts on it just you
know it just shrivels away so what you
have to do is say well the facts really
didn't matter you had these
Machiavellian schemes and so on all
right that's the Kennedy assassination
story the 9/11 one is a pretty
interesting actually it's a huge part of
the country I mean I think it's like
maybe a third of the population or half
the population the activists into the
people in the center of it
as far as I can tell it was very few of
them are people with any record or
involved
political activism not doing anything
maybe a couple here and there most are
just drawn into it and you know there's
and they have factoids too like somebody
found nano-thermite whatever the hell
that is
and the bottom of building seven or
whatever okay I have no idea what it
means or if it means anything but that's
the core of a large part of the evidence
there was none by the Bush
administration now the people who are
writing about this they are experts in
physics and civil engineering on the
basis of an hour on the Internet okay so
you spent an hour in the Internet you
become a super expert in civil
engineering physics and you learn what
nano-thermite is and you know that so on
and it's kind of like you know I don't
have to tell you what it takes to
understand something about physics not
an hour on the Internet
they've managed to collect a very small
scattering of architects and you know
one or two people who are supposed to be
scientists and a couple of others who
write articles in the Journal of 9/11
studies and maybe sometimes in an online
journal somewhere and so okay that
proves that the scientific world is with
us and then comes along a big story some
obvious questions like suppose the Bush
administration did it why would they
blame Saudis yeah are they insane no I
mean they wanted to invade Iraq right
everybody agrees with that so what they
blame Iraqis okay if they had blamed
Iraqis open-shut case you can hold
countries for you you get a UN
resolution and NATO supports you just go
ahead and invade Iraq since they blame
Saudis there for harming themselves
that's their closest ally they had to go
jump through hoops to try to invent
stories about weapons of mass
destruction and connections al-qaeda and
all this other thing they finally
invaded Iraq so like are they lunatics
and that's one possibility of course you
got another explanation for why they
should blame
yes because they're very very very
devious yeah that's exactly what you get
they would have been too obvious if
they'd blamed Iraqis so they had to do
some other way
yeah you can't looking to find answers
to anything if you try hard enough and
huge efforts are going into this nothing
is ever going to happen they tried it
for you know seven years they never
indicted Bush of course we're never
going to they go on for another fifty
years it's never going to have any
effect it does have an effect it diverts
a lot of energy and effort from from
trying to do something like say stop the
war in Iraq but of course you know that
takes effort that's costly and so on
they also feel extremely brave because
it's so risky to write a note on the
internet saying you know I think Bush is
a really bad guy Wow you know you're
practically in Guantanamo and you know
then they couldn't find some guy who
instead of teaching his courses that
thought about this stuff and therefore
wasn't rehired which is normal and like
you know I would have never been rehired
if I'd done it I put courses on this
kind of stuff but in my spare time you
know you have some duties in the
university but you didn't put all the
stuff together and get some story so
you're feeling very brave and bold and
then come stories about the reasons why
people like me don't go along we're
secret CIA agents we're I think the
phrase is left gatekeepers there's a
category of left gatekeepers the
government inserts into the popular
movements people who pretend to be
critical but they're really gatekeepers
you know they're just trying to stop the
real criticism and like you know Bush
put the bombs in building seven and so
on and you can build up big stories like
that and a lot of people believe me I
mean it's a little bit like believing
that the reason for you know why my life
is collapsing is because the rich
liberals who own the corporation's
you're giving everything away to illegal
immigrants you know it's an answer to
you know you'll find some factoids about
that but people who are you know kind of
at a loss you know then
first anything rightly you know they're
not trust institutions they think it res
lying to them their lies are no good
nothing makes any sense okay
these things have a certain appeal they
like Rush Limbaugh they have an internal
logic that maybe the only yeah and if
you don't understand what a explanation
is a collection of factoids is an
explanation there's one part of it that
is pretty striking at least to me which
is if 30 or 40 percent of the United
States population believes that Bush did
it I mean obviously it's ludicrous but
30 or 40 percent of the population
believes you did it well that means
there's virtually nothing that the left
can say to that 30 40 percent of the
United States
that's worse I mean I mean how bad can
you get right so so then you have to ask
why is that 30 40 percent not doing
anything given that they think they live
in whatever is that they think yeah they
think they're living there run by a mass
murderer wants to kill the American
people yeah okay let's go on to the next
topic but it is it no but it is
interesting because it says what do you
have to do to talk to that sector people
not about 911 but about changing the
world that they live in I ask a lot of
people that so you know you think you're
being run by a maniac and want to kill
all the Americans won't you do anything
about it the answer is always the same
it's hopeless yeah that's there's
nothing we can do I mean we're just
victims of some powerful force because
it says something to us about what our
agenda has to be we have to overcome
that
yes did you say look you there are
things you can do about the real
problems first of all can you figure out
the real problems are then you can do
something about them but of course
that's you know that for the person
you're talking to that's a much harder
choice or it's easier to say I can't do
anything I give up it's easier to say
that then to say look there are a lot of
things I can do and then go ahead and do
them and they really are risky and so on
it's certainly with a lot of things I
mean take say the that's very graphic
it's very true this one's very graphic
there are a lot of others not quite this
graphic but it takes a the Israeli Lobby
story it's extremely convenient
to believe that the Israeli Lobby
controls the United States first of all
what can I do you know the Jews are so
powerful I can't do anything the other
thing is it preserves American innocence
so we are the city on the hill that's
just that we're being led around by
these Jews what can we do and in many
ways a very attractive position I mean
it falls apart as soon as you look at it
obviously but it does make any
difference and it does attract a lot of
people on the left a lot of people yeah
is there such a thing as human nature or
are the groups or the people who deny
the possibility of such a thing which
includes a great many Marxist correct
and denying that there's any such thing
as human nature well either there is
such thing as human nature or humans or
angels from another planet or another
universe I mean any organism that exists
in the organic world has a nature that's
what distinguishes it from other
organisms so we're different from
insects we're different from Apes you
know and so on and so forth and that can
either be because we're like other
organisms and we have some kind of a
nature or it's because maybe God
implanted us in the world or something
like that those are the two options now
you're actually right about marks of
people call themselves Marxists in fact
even well-known Marxist like Graham Chi
say that there's no major human Asian is
just history if you can find a couple of
phrases like that it marks they can't
have meant what they said what they
probably meant was human nature can take
many different having many different
exemplification those depending on
circumstances which is of course true
the same is true of NZ but but this has
become a kind of a slogan that's
considered sort of very it's considered
that if you on the left or what's called
the left that if you deny that there's
any human nature you're in favor of
change if you say there is a human
nature you got to be reactionary because
you're seeing you know people have to be
rotten
I've slaves and so on there's nothing
like that in fact if you take a look at
Marx they'd pay fealty to it was a
dedicated lever in human nature I mean
in fact he took most of his ideas right
out of the Enlightenment and the
Romantic period where he lived with then
he carried them over that's this concept
of alienation for example and you know
somehow your fundamental nature is a
need for creative work under your own
control if it's dominated by others you
get alienated labor or the whole story
comes out of that it's based on a
conception of human nature isn't any
evidence for it well let's take the real
study I mean let's let's assume we're
not angels
okay we're organisms so therefore there
is human nature okay then we try to
discover what it is well we do it the
way we discover what be nature is
there's much harder you know very much
more complicated organisms and unlike
other organisms we can't do direct
experiments but if you want to study the
parts of human nature that have to do
with the issues that matter in human
affairs you can't do anything much in
the way of comparative evidence because
humans are isn't different there isn't
much in the way of comparative evidence
some that's pretty thin and what there
is is you know that evolutionary
distance of 12 15 million years and so
long time other animals have changed and
we've changed so you just don't get much
under some comparative evidence but not
much direct experimental evidence yes
there's some in some areas well it takes
a language work I work yes quite a lot
of evidence there and that it's a unique
human property there's nothing remotely
like it in the animal world as far as we
know but you can learn a lot about it
because it's kind of isolated and you
could separate it from other things
actually many of the questions you'd
like to ask about language are beyond
experiment the traditional questions
elect for example how you and I are
doing what we're not doing how are we
able to produce freely
new expressions that have maybe new
ideas that have never been expressed and
you say that I understand that and so on
and so forth
but some high school a big creative
aspect of language use which is a big
topic and you know in in the tradition I
mean Descartes or so on both others but
we don't know we can't study that we can
study the mechanisms that are into it
but not much about the so as you get to
choice and decision and so on you're
kind of at that see but there are a lot
of topics you can study there are many
that are beyond what we know how to
study but there's got to be a nature
otherwise we're kind of like either
we're angels we're kind of like amoebas
you know anything that happens to us
just shapes us and we become some
shapeless form of it a baby could grow
up to be a penguin
yeah something yeah exactly I mean like
there's a huge debate about whether it
is an innate language faculty well I
mean the answer that is so trivial that
you could have to wonder who's asking
the question I mean like if say my
granddaughter and her pet a chimp or you
know songbird whatever have exactly the
same data how come my granddaughter
picks out of the data something that's
language related reflexively of course
and then again reflexively ends up doing
what you and I are doing whereas the
other animals knowing take the first
step was either a miracle or she's got a
language faculty no other option but
there's a huge debate about that even
among people called scientists and that
people are extremely rational about
themselves for some reason but yes there
has to be a human nature if there wasn't
you know it's it's tough it's
inconceivable and we can try to find out
what it is well you know on issues that
really matter to us the sciences don't
tell us very much I'll tell you a little
also for example why our people say
altruistic why do you help others okay
there's some evidence from biology most
of it just sort of gives some basis for
what you know anyway
so people tend to be the more caring for
their children and for their cousins
let's see okay you can give a story
about kin selection
you know the genes that get proliferate
and so on it tells you something I mean
it doesn't tell you why people on Cape
Cod go into icy waters and storms to try
to rescue stranded dolphins no kin
relationship but they do it you know and
doesn't tell you why they spend huge
effort in doing that but don't care
about a kids starving across the blood
street you know they don't tell you way
to take care of your stepchildren you
know we you know they're stepped in I
mean so yeah it tells you something and
there are some there's one there's one
category reciprocal altruism work done
by Robert rivers very good biologist now
which actually has some interesting
results you know you help somebody else
to help you so on most things you just
have to rely on what we call intuition
yellow meaning introspection experience
no heavens of history whatever they may
be and you can get some no not vacuous
speculations about what human beings are
like what's the utility of the view that
there is no human nature that causes it
to be widespread particularly on the
left utility is that you can convince
yourself if you're sufficiently
irrational that that means we can
introduce changes incidentally these
views are extremely popular among a
segment of the left the Leninist segment
they may deny it but the UM of these
views are useful for people who want to
be managers if they're no human nature
then if I control people there's no
moral barrier to it because if there's
no human nature anyway I can determine
what they should be and of course I'm
completely benevolent because oh they're
there's no human nature or other people
there is for me so I'm benevolent and I
know it's right
and therefore I can kind of help these
amoebas to turn into good things instead
of bad things it's a very convenient
doctrine for the managerial question
which includes a lot of left
unfortunately there are people who will
respond to the idea of justice equity
fairness people controlling their own
lives and they'll say yeah it sounds
nice but human nature precludes it human
nature is such that and I'm talking
about you know caring people who will
just say yeah of course I'd like to live
in a better world like that but it's
like asking a tree to fly it's not
possible because there is a human nature
and human nature is such that it
precludes the possibility of the that
kind of situation and yields instead
what we see all around us and we've seen
through history how would you try to
talk to to counter to address that kind
of view which is very widespread all
right two ways first the way you counter
you try to count you try to evaluate any
factual statement now you made a factual
claim back it up I do a scientific basis
for idea of evidence for well you know
they're gonna say my evidence is all
over I have a history of well that's
what they're going to say I have a
history of suffering and conflict and
you have denial benevolence you know
dedication to improving things you know
history tells you all kind of things
don't tell you what you want that the
same history can say the opposite if you
want so you're picking out of history
certain features which haven't have an
interesting consequence they prevent you
from doing anything they're very
self-serving I mean if nothing can be
changed then it's fine if you just want
to be a rant or something but you have
no evidence for it because if you take a
look at history just as well find the
opposite that you can show in history
that Kropotkin was right and saying that
mutual age is a factor evolution okay
as good as the evidence to the contrary
so you take the range of history and
experience and so on and you can pick
out something that will justify you in
just looking out for number one or you
can take something that would justify
you in devoting yourself to the welfare
of others it's your choice but you can't
claim any argument from history it
actually really take arguments from
history seriously you know we could
argue about how seriously should do it
but there is something noticeable I mean
there is a tendency throughout history
towards more and more commitment to
justice equity and freedom and you see
it pretty clearly we even see it in our
own lifetimes I'm like they say women's
rights rights of minorities concern over
future generations the environmentalist
movement that is very limited for year
fifty years ago now it's quite broad you
go back further and say the right to
vote you know right to associate that
right a freedom of speech you know by
and large rights there has been a tended
as regression you know a lot of horrible
things but one pretty noticeable
tendency in histories towards more
freedom and justice and equity but the
interesting thing actually one
interesting thing is when you when
people engage in antisocial behavior
they have to and routinely do act as
though that's not what they're doing
they cover it with a rationalization
well why would you need to do that if
antisocial behavior was actually wired
in and part of us we wouldn't alibi it
we would just say that's what we're
doing I mean a wolf would say I'm eating
the Sheep because I'm trying to help the
Sheep it would just I'm eating the Sheep
to them hungry that's right and the same
thing goes for human no nobody does that
Henry Kissinger probably and say it is
on the Cambodia bombing but you know if
yeah that's good argument why do you
bother to rationalize
my upper back isn't
