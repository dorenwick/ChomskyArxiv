you mentioned global warming see it's
very interesting the way that's
portrayed in the media it's portrayed as
if there's two sides you know we have to
be objective so 50% for each uh one side
is like 99% of scientists the other side
is Rush limbo Sarah Palin Jim and huff
and you know three guys that they kind
of contrarians in the science community
so we give them equal time and then
how's the ordinary citizen going to
figure it out actually the New York
Times had a front page story a couple
days ago about the very interesting
controversy that's taking place between
climate scientists and what they call
meteorologists the people who appear on
television to tell you whe it's going to
rain tomorrow uh and they differ so
how's the ordinary citizen going to
figure it out well you know you don't
want it first of all it should be
pointed out that there actually three
three sides there's not two there's the
M you know the the mainstream scientific
consensus and there's two groups that of
denialists one of them is the one that's
given equal time you know Center inhof
Rush limbo but there's another one which
is very significant major groups of
scientists who think that the uh uh
mainstream analyses are nowhere near
grave enough they're all this very
serious work I mean MIT just came out
with a big study Their scientist saying
the reality is far worse than what's
predicted well they're not part of the
debate okay so what's the ordinary
citizen going to do well he's not going
to become a climate scientist but you
know the choices in this case are so
transparent that it doesn't take a lot
of work to figure it out I mean what's
the chances that uh you know the
overwhelming majority of climate
scientists from all over the place uh
either the ones who say it's very grave
or the others who say it's even worse
than you claim uh what are the
probability that they're wrong in Russo
is right you know I mean it's it's not a
hard decision you don't have to be an
expert and there's another point to be
made about all of
this if if you try to Think Through the
cost benefit analysis suppose the people
who deny it are correct and you do
something about it okay you've spent
some money doing things you probably
should have done anyway you know like
more renewable energy and so on uh but
the total cost is it cost you something
suppose on the other hand that the
consensus is right well if you don't do
anything uh human species is probably
down the drain okay those are the costs
you have to estimate that's not
particularly
[Applause]
subtle now it's too late to prevent
really massive change but not too late
to prevent the worst kind of Dipping
points I mean we've already increased
moisture in the atmosphere about 5% the
ocean's about 30% more acidic uh we're
seeing delu and flood in kind of
unprecedented ways um um these are very
dangerous powerful things that we're not
going to be able to push back into the
closet um but uh Everything's Relative
and it can get a lot lot worse than that
if we don't wise up pretty soon we
haven't done all that good a job of
organizing people who I think that
environmentalists have counted on the
fact that they were right uh to do the
work for them uh we had for 20 years the
kind of superstructure of a movement we
had scientists and policy people and
engineers and things we just never had
any
movement that was the part we left out
you know and that's what we've been
trying to build at 350.org with some
success over the last year both here and
around the
world
