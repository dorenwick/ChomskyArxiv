hello i'm richard gisbert and you're
watching a special edition of the
listening post it's been 30 years now
since the publication of one of the most
influential books ever written about the
institution that we cover the media
manufacturing consent the political
economy of the mass media was
co-authored by noam chomsky and edward
herrmann the book provided searing
critiques of journalism and the news
media's relationship to power it spelled
out how media corporations and the
journalists who work for them often end
up defending the economic social and
political agendas of governments and
corporations it walked us through how
the media represents certain privileged
groups in society while effectively
suppressing the voices of others
most of us working on this program have
been influenced in one way or another by
manufacturing consent and so to mark the
anniversary of its publication we went
to tucson arizona to talk to noam
chomsky it's a two-part interview we
began by showing professor chomsky the
following animation one that we made
last year that boiled down some of the
basic arguments that he and herman made
in manufacturing consent
in 1988 noam chomsky co-authored a book
with edward hermann called
manufacturing consent
it blasted apart the notion that media
acts as a check on political powers
media operate through five filters
the first has to do with ownership mass
media firms are big corporations
often they're part of even bigger
conglomerates
their end game
profit
and so it's in their interest to push
for whatever guarantees that profit
critical journalism takes second place
to the needs and interests
of the corporation
[Music]
the second filter exposes the real role
of advertising
media costs a lot more than consumers
will ever pay
so who fills the gap
advertisers
and what are the advertisers paying for
audiences
and so it isn't so much that the media
are selling you a product their output
they're also selling advertisers a
product
you
how does the establishment manage the
media that's the third filter
journalism cannot be a check on power
because the very system encourages
complicity
governments corporations big
institutions know how to play the media
game they know how to influence the news
narrative they feed media scoops
official accounts interviews with the
experts
they make themselves crucial to the
process of journalism
so those in power and those who report
on them are in bed with each other
if you want to challenge power you'll be
pushed to the margins your name won't be
down you won't be getting in
you've lost your access
you've lost the story
when the media journalists
whistleblowers sources stray away from
the consensus they get flat
that's the fourth filter
when the story is inconvenient for the
powers that be you'll see the flat
machine in action discrediting sources
trashing stories and diverting the
conversation
to manufacture consent you need an enemy
a target
that common enemy is the fifth filter
communism
terrorists
immigrants
a common enemy
a boogeyman to fear helps corral public
opinion
five filters
one big media theory
consent is being manufactured all around
you
all the time
so professor chomsky does that video
capture
the ideas that you wanted in that book
i think it's brilliantly done i think
its success will be measured by whether
it encourages people to ask
what does it mean
when you have
concentrated private power
producing a product namely audiences
for a market which consists of
concentrated private power
with tight links to state power
what do you expect the media
output to look like and with that
framework of a structural framework
behind it if it encourages people to ask
that question i think it'll be very
successful
the title manufacturing consent it does
get to the crux of how you see the role
of the media in western democracies we
get the feeling that you were out to
destroy a few myths
well interestingly the
term the phrase manufacturing consent
was not ours we borrowed it from the
leading public intellectual of the
20th century walter lippmann he said
that's a new art in democracy
to manufacture consent so that the
ignorant and meddlesome outsiders his
phrase the population will be passive
and acquiescent and will accept the rule
of the responsible men people like us
and in fact the myth is that the media
are
independent adversarial
courageous struggling against power and
it's actually true of some
the they're very fine often very fine
reporters correspondents in fact the
media does an honest courageous job but
within a framework
that determines
what to discuss
what not to discuss and what we try to
demonstrate in the book is that
if you simply look at the institutional
structure of the media
within a state capitalist society like
ours
they're performing pretty much the way
you'd expect
we'll get back to the rest of that
interview in just a few minutes over the
years manufacturing consent has sold
millions of copies it's had a profound
influence on many accomplished
journalists and not just in the u.s we
spoke to three of them the
editor-in-chief of the huffington post's
indian edition amman seti the israeli
journalist amira hass and matt taibi an
american best known for his work with
rolling stone magazine we asked them
about the book what they took from it
and the importance of critical analysis
of the global news media today
[Music]
manufacturing consent had a big
influence on me as a young reporter i
had always thought that we lived in a
completely free society where the
reporting was outstanding the free press
model worked exactly the way it should
and when i read that book i realized
that there were significant problems
the book and the notion and the analysis
first of all unveiled america of the
myth
of being such a splendid democracy so it
was part of chomsky's and others and
attempts to show that there are so many
deficiencies in this democracy that are
being ignored by many analysts
he is saying that there is a
superstructure of power that
basically uses the media as propaganda
that is his broad formulation and i
would push back against that and say
that it's not easy to manufacture that
kind of consent today because when
people receive news it's not like people
actually believe everything they see on
the news right so i think one of the
legacies of manufacturing consent has
been
that it kind of provided a
neat
formulation to sum up the unease that
people felt with a
monolithic production of information
[Music]
is a very
humanist and optimistic statement
that believes that people
with information
can bring to a change and this is how i
started really when i started working in
gaza in the early 90s aware that the
israeli public knows nothing about the
occupation and what it means
i was waiting for for my information
to to reach others and to
change the awareness
and i realized quite soon that this was
not the case
well i think we've seen many graphic
examples of how we can manufacture
consent through the media
i think the ultimate example has to be
the invasion of iraq in 2003
if you had told americans after 9 11
that we were going to invade a country
that had no connection to the 9 11
hijackers
and that we were going to do it under
the pretense of combating international
terrorism most people would have thought
you were crazy but we were able to sell
that idea relatively easily to the
entire american population this is fox
news and fox news channel continuing
coverage of the campaign which now has
begun to liberate and disarm iraq but
all they really needed was a few key
voices
um among the highest
opinion makers in the country and on tv
the read we get on the people of iraq is
there's no question but what they want
to get rid of saddam hussein and they
will welcome as liberators the united
states when we come to do that and we
were able to sell that war pretty easily
i think sourcing is actually perhaps
one of the most interesting filters that
he talks about
i think sourcing is something that all
journalists have to think a lot about
we should think very hard about
which which or what are the sources that
we give credence and balance to
uh which are the sources that we give
importance to and which are the sources
we don't give importance to
so who decides about the hierarchy what
is important what is not important very
often i realize that if you have
information that is official
this is called investigative journalism
but if you actually
talk about the main the same thing
from the mouth of the people themselves
let's say about dangers of of a water
contamination in gaza if it's the people
themselves this is not seen as a serious
or as serious information as when it
comes from an official
i come from a family of journalists my
father was a reporter uh dating back to
the 60s when he started in the business
reporters tended to come
from more humble origins a lot of people
didn't go to college they entered the
business as paper kids or as printers
when they were 16 or so
but in the 70s after all the president's
men woodward
bernstein
get in here
journalism became sexy it became a thing
for upper class ivy league kids to do
and by the time i was in the business
and i'm you know i'm partly
representative of the of this problem
because i came from that class myself we
all live in cities we represent a
certain point of view we hang out with
politicians and their aides we we are
part of the ruling class and our failure
to recognize that
it's not you know it's not necessarily
through any fault of our own but but
we're
very separate and distinct from the
the ordinary person chomsky's model
produces a sense of inevitability which
is wrong even if i say that i have the
freedom to write about whatever i want
to write about chomsky will say yeah
that's because there's already a filter
in front of you and you don't even know
what you can't write about how how can
you how can you know that i'm
self-censoring how can you know
i'm sure you believe everything you're
saying but what i'm saying is if you
believe something different you wouldn't
be sitting where you're sitting it's
easy to say that people believe what
they believe because their consent has
been manufactured but what if people
know exactly what's going on and still
believe what they believe right then
that's terrifying right and i think
that's what
even maybe chomsky can't bring himself
to look at
the fact that if people say
i don't care about the facts i still
believe that this should happen
then what do you say about the whole
formulation of manufacturing consent the
book and the concept are relevant
because they offer
to every journalist a kind of
lighthouse
it invokes people's skepticism and this
is always important though as i said
before i think that the problems are
that today we have so much access to
information in other ways
that we are in a collision with the fact
that people are not interested in what
does not serve immediately their
interest and this is a very sad
realization
so i think
the legacy of chomsky's book in that
sense is that it provides us with a
manual
of commonly made mistakes
and so i think it's something that then
makes us think
about what we're doing and makes us more
mindful of our journalism
when you wrote this book in 1988 roughly
50 corporations controlled every single
mass media outlet in the united states
now there are just six time warner
viacom news corp disney among them what
effect has that had do you think on
democracy in america
all of that cheapens and reduces the
access to information and understanding
now there is a way to compensate for
that
the internet
does
allow us
to
reach
to if if people organize form
collectives
interact with one another it's possible
to use the enormous resources that are
available
to overcome
the impact of the concentration of media
and in fact can be done pretty
effectively earlier this year american
television viewers were treated to the
spectacle on
the sinclair broadcasting system which
is not that well known a company but
which owns hundreds of local affiliates
in the united states the sharing of
biased and false
on news media
they put out an editorial
an editorial where the same words were
read by hundreds of different news
anchors
small cities from kansas to the florida
panhandle
what did you make of all those news
anchors in all those markets mouthing
those same words and reading those same
scripts i remember compelled to do so
they didn't have a choice
you wanted to stay and
keep your job you read what big brother
told you to read
this is a mode of propaganda that we
associate with totalitarian states the
fact that it's done by a private tyranny
which is what a corporation is uh
doesn't change the character of it and
it's kind of interesting that in real in
actual
totalitarian states say the old soviet
union
people
studies showed that people tended to
distrust the media because it was so
obvious that it was coming from the
state authorities i always found it
interesting that after the wall came
down all these western journalists were
send in by various western foundations
to train
journalists from eastern europe warsaw
pact countries but what i knew of those
places was that their news consumers
were far more discerning about what
information they were taking in and i
thought rather than sending western
journalists to quote-unquote train
russian or polish journalists we should
send
news consumers from those countries to
come west to train us what do you think
of that idea well the studies of the old
soviet union which were intensive
showed that a large part of the
population
recognized that what they're getting is
a controlled
authoritarian
centered
propaganda
the western system propaganda is nowhere
near that crude it looks independent
there is
a certain amount of variety that when
sinclair
sends out a
demand that everyone read the same
editorial that's unusual
it's not the kind of thing that's done
in the western system
in the eastern system it was done and
that does lead to a healthy skepticism
that's exactly what you noticed we don't
have to go back far
to the days the halcyon days of social
media
the arab spring 2011 so much optimism in
the air and the belief that the rise of
these alternative voices on these
platforms would have a democratizing
effect
on governance turns out that that was
misguided what happened
well first of all
there is a positive
aspect to the social media
almost all
activist movements rely on them to bring
people together and so on so what
happened in the first months the arab
spring was very exciting
you may recall that at one point
the dictator mubarak
closed the internet to try to prevent
the social media from functioning
what happened is that activism increased
because instead of sending
messages out
electronically people actually talk to
each other
that's the basic the
essential way to organize and
create a kind of culture of what i call
collective self-defense you couldn't
have foreseen
the emergence of the tech giants who are
such a big part of the global news media
today
and their rise has made them unwieldy
purveyors of power
they've grown rich at the expense of
many media outlets has anyone come up
with useful ways of how and what to do
with them how to deal with them and what
to do with them well not really
remember that these are not the sources
of news
like facebook doesn't have
bureaus
around the world what these have created
is a
an array of social media
which
are double-edged sometimes they're used
for constructive purposes
but they have also become
major
uh
forces for undermining a democracy we
see that everywhere
right now in brazil for example with
scandals erupting correctly about
the fact that millions of dollars were
spent to
produce defamatory information on the
social media against the
pt the workers party to support the
literally neo-fascist candidate who won
the campaign it's only one example
these things are now happening over and
over and it's a very dangerous
phenomenon
you've written a great deal about latin
america and a few years back leaders
such as
chavez in venezuela morales in bolivia
the kirchners in argentina correa in
ecuador they were all pushing for
some form of media reform to spread
ownership out to limit the power of
conglomerates in latin america their
critics then accused them of basically
trying to usurp
the powers from the political right and
drag them off
to the left did the critics of those
leaders who were trying to reform media
and latin america actually have a point
in fact the problem of in all of the
countries you mentioned is they didn't
do anywhere or near enough to try to set
up
alternative independent public uh
publicly
controlled media that would counter the
high concentration of ultra-right media
in latin america which has been a
scandal for years manufacturing consent
is a considered a seminal work it's not
an easy read for people it's and it's a
difficult area to explore and dissect on
television in particular because of its
limitations and the limited attention
spans of some of the people who are
watching this program
in conveying some of these ideas have
you ever thought of taking some of those
media training courses that those
corporate executives take that train
them to speak in sound bites
probably not huh
i remember once there was a program
called the nightline on television abc
and they got a lot of criticism because
i was never on it
and the director
said
i'm not the kind of person they could
have on
because i don't understand concision
namely saying two sentences between ads
and that's a terrific form of propaganda
so for example if you're asked
is iran a terrorist state you can say
yes they do this and then the other
thing if you if you're asked is the
united states a terrorist state which is
of course way beyond iran you can't say
it in two minutes because first you have
to break down the prejudices and
assumptions and dogmas about the united
states being a force for freedom and
democracy you can't do that
between two ads so the very idea of
concision
is a
fine technique for imposing
the propaganda of the
power of those who are powerful they can
say anything they want against enemies
in two minutes
but they can't be exposed in two minutes
final question for you when you get up
in the morning
where do you go to get your news
first thing i look at is the new york
times
still it's still
with all of its flaws and they're real
it still has the broadest and most
comprehensive
coverage of i think any newspaper in the
world and then where do you go from
there then
many other places
washington post the business press
foreign press al jazeera
democracy now many other sources
noam chomsky thank you so much for
joining us the listening post thank you
one of the last points that chomsky made
about starting his news day with the new
york times we included that because we
found his response telling noam chomsky
is among the times's sharpest critics
but he doesn't simply dismiss the
newspaper he doesn't as so many people
suspicious of the mainstream media have
cut the cord and live in a world void of
conventional news outlets he goes there
but he considers the source he does the
diligence shops around gets other views
sometimes from outside the american news
bubble he co-wrote the book 30 years ago
but there's a lesson in there for news
consumers trying to make sense of the
media today
you've been watching a special edition
of our program we'll see you next time
here at the listening post
