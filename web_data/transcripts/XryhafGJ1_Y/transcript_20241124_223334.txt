well n Chomsky it is a really a great
pleasure and honor to welcome you to
darham Castle to the University of
darham and to the northeast of England
uh when I mentioned to people that you
were going to come here uh the
excitement was palpable the Twitter
feeds which I by the way I don't follow
were apparently very excited
and uh uh there's been a great buildup
really to your visit but I I I everyone
knows in a sense Nome chsky we know your
formidable scholarly achievements and
your activism but I thought it would be
quite interesting to spend 20 minutes
half an hour with you just talking about
how you got to to be a political figure
so I thought I might start by asking you
about where you came from about your
family how you grew up and whether you
were always a publicly engaged figure
we're always political as a young
person my parents were immigrants uh my
father uh fled from right near Kev from
the people who are now in power so uh in
1913 right before the first world war my
mother came as a baby a couple years
earlier uh it I grew up in U there a
Jewish family they lived in a kind of a
Jewish cultural ghetto not a physical
ghetto but they uh they were both Hebrew
teachers my father was a Hebrew scholar
and the environment in which they lived
was a essentially Jewish cultural ghetto
I don't think they had any non-jewish
friends for example uh the
uh they didn't know it but we we lived
in
a uh in a community that was mostly U
German and Irish and very anti-semitic
so I grew up on the streets in uh sort
of running away from the tough Irish
kids you know and uh I I remember beer
parties when Paris fell for example they
were quite
prazi
and my parents were oblivious to this
they had no conception that anything
like this was happening those days
children parents didn't talk to each
other uh I grew I grew up in the
depression the family was mostly uh
unemployed working class and um earliest
memories are childhood memories
are people coming to the door trying to
sell rags and riding on a trolley with
my mother and watching passing a textile
strike where the police are beating
people bloody uh
talking with my relatives about their
lives an uncle one uncle was a had a new
stand which he he himself had never gone
past about fourth grade but very
self-educate uh self-educated and very
cultivated person his news stand became
a kind of a center of discussion and
debate a lot of imigra and I sell papers
there and listen and so on and U by the
time I was about uh 11 or 12 my parents
would we lived in
Philadelphia um but my parents would
allow me to go to New York by myself
stay with my
relatives I spent a lot of time
and in well in those days Union Square
in New York used to be a center for
radical offices FR AR you know other
Anarchist Jewish anch do as others and
the street going down below at Fourth
Avenue now all gentrified used to have a
lot of small
bookstores uh many of them run by recent
igr some of them the ones I happen to be
attracted to by um immigrates from Spain
and I very quickly got quite interested
in the Spanish Civil War and in
particular in the anarchist movement in
Spain uh in fact the first U article I
remember writing was which I can date
precisely was right after the fall of
Barcelona so it was February 1939 and it
was kind of a lament about the spread of
fascism over Europe I'm sure it was not
very profound I hope it's disappeared
forever but that was the topic at least
but and from then on it was more or less
the same when the
uh the second world war broke out right
after that so that became a big issue I
was rather very anti-fascist but quite
critical of u a lot of the way in which
the war was framed and
fought as I'm sure you know in the
United States there was a differentiated
attitude towards the Germans and the
Japanese the Germans were
bad people you know that's what the
propaganda was but they were not unlike
us the Japanese which is a verman they
had to be destroyed and
crushed uh and then the racism was just
incredible you know it's and number of
us were quite critical of that in fact U
the high school where I was happened to
be right next to a prisoner of war camp
barbed wire separating them and uh
there was the students in the school
would during recess would go out and
sort of mock the prisoners you know
could talk to them across and a number
of us tried to were quite opposed to
that tried to stop it they look they're
human beings like us they were drafted
they didn't have any choice yeah U and
then went on when the British
U it took invaded
Greece it was very violent brutal it was
strongly opposed to that with tiny group
of students and uh it just went on from
there if I could just clarify a little
bit but it sounds like your parents you
you make it very clear actually your
parents were not were not political they
were had little awareness of what was
going on around them so was this
something about the values of your
background that you know you you you you
were an immigrant who came from an
immigrant family you were something of
an outsider so you were both of the US
but outside the US at the same time do
you think that tension in a young person
helped illuminate things that you might
not some others may not have seen CU it
sounds like from the beginning you had a
critical Edge that is to say a critical
awareness of the circumstances of your
life well my parents were conventional
Roosevelt Democrats um there were splits
in the Jewish community at the time
there was a hebraic and a yiddishist my
parents for both of them their native
language was Yiddish but I never heard a
word of Yiddish they wouldn't talk it
because they were on the Hebrew side of
the cultur comp and the Revival of
Hebrew my father was a dedicated Zionist
but in a sense that's not considered
Zionism today he was a follower of a
hadam who wanted to create a cultural
center in Palestine that would be the
revive the diaspora culture and so on
and uh Revival of Hebrew was a central
part of it his own uh he himself was a
Hebrew scholar did a worked on medieval
Hebrew grammar actually Ah that's an
interesting connection when I was a kid
I read his PhD
thesis but uh and that was their world
and I was part of that of course with my
father from childhood Friday night that
we'd read Hebrew together Hebrew
literature from the yes 19th century and
studied the Bible and so on and so forth
but the other side of my life was
uh the my own political interests which
came from elsewhere by the time you a
young man at University H how would you
characterize your your your kind of
political engagement I mean you
obviously we're steeped in a diversity
of radical backgrounds uh you've already
described being drawn to the Spanish
anarchists but I wonder as your
political views develop whether you
whether you understood yourself to be
working within a framework within a
tradition or were you carving something
out that was distinctive from the more
or less from the beginning well I was it
was a very Lively period remember the
late 1930s early 40s but not not like
the subsequent period at all and there
was every I mean I I would spend U
Saturday afternoons in the Philadelphia
Public Library which for some reason had
every imaginable radical
publication i' just be working through
these every conceivable cult yes had
some and by the time I was say 12 or 13
I was uh an antie Bolshevik leftist Andy
bolik from the left uh and U so I was I
was a lot of my own personal commitments
actually were involved with what was
then called Zionism what would now be
called anti Zionism right a commitment
to uh working for uh Arab Jewish
cooperation in a bational Palestine
based on uh working class institutions
and cooperations of a kind of quaz
anarchist kind which is not as exotic as
it may sound today then it was maybe not
realistic but not off the planet you
know and uh but I could and there was a
one of the uh Zionist groups was pretty
close to this and some respect
Sasha but I could never join them
because they were split
between trite and stalinist and I was
opposed to both of them so I kind of
hovered around the fringes but than that
it was U there were I wasn't alone there
were people but not a lot look Looking
Back Now from where you are today and
your
extraordinary um uh history both as an
academic but as a public intellectual
and critic critic of um American
engagements imperialism the war machines
the uh uh American uh self-interest
Outreach and so on how would you say
your views today are different from you
know they were when you were a young man
I mean what are the big changes that you
that you would register as you know
formative of the Chomsky today looking
back
now uh odly enough not not much in
principle of course I know a lot more
than I didn't know then yeah I mean for
example at the time Second World War I
was and I had a kind of skeptical
attitude toward the Pacific War yeah but
it was only later that I learned about
the intricacies of the background and
what drove Japan to become a brutal
violent imperialist power the West had
plenty of considerable role in that the
British and the Americans and uh so and
the same in other domains so but um kind
of
fundamental principles other than kind
of sharpening modifying to some extent I
wouldn't say
so there weren't any trigger points like
the Vietnam War which was CU I was in
the US of course during the last part of
the Vietnam War I remember in 1974 the
sense of celebrations when was seeing
that the war was coming to an end you
wouldn't describe the Vietnam War or uh
uh any successive events as as critical
in in changing your kinds of engagements
and the way you stood out
changes for example U August 6th 1945
yeah was a change I was a a counselor in
the summer camp a Hebrew speaking camp
and uh the news one morning was
announced
that hirosa had been bombed by an atom
bomb
and uh I was shocked and even more
shocked by the fact that nobody
cared uh people listened and went on to
the next activity in fact I was so
shocked I just took off by myself walked
off into the woods and sat there for a
couple hours and disappeared and that I
mean I realized at that time I think
nobody could fail to realize that we're
now facing the possibility and the
likelihood of destroying ourselves that
was a significant change uh the Vietnam
War I I mean I followed it in the late
40s and early 50s which was the crucial
period could didn't really know then
what we know now about the internal
deliberations they've been revealed
later but in uh by about 1961 or so when
in 1961 Kennedy sharply escalated the
War uh the it was barely reported but
there was enough there were enough
tidbits coming through so you could see
what was happening uh he sent the
American Air Force to uh carry out
bombing in South Vietnam under South
Vietnam's cover
initiated chemical warfare to destroy
crops and ground cover and began the
programs of rounding people up and into
what am out of the Concentration Camp
strategic hamlets was clear that a
substantial escalation was going on and
um I kind of debated with myself as to
how deeply to become involved I had
enough political experience to know that
you just can't put one foot in if you
start involvement it's going to take
over yeah and I had a pretty comfortable
life I
had a young family um I had a I was a
professor at MIT kind of job that I
liked to do the research I wanted and I
knew perfectly well that if I get
involved in this this is going to change
yeah and I thought about it for a while
but I did become involved at the time it
was a very lonely Commitment if you
wanted to give a talk on
the Vietnam War say in
1963 it would be in somebody's living
room or the church with four
people just to illust you came later 74
but uh the
first there was an international day of
protest against the war in October
1965 and our we we had an anti-war group
at the time and we decided to have have
a demonstration on the Boston Common you
know the standard place for political
action uh there was a demonstration but
it was completely broken up by um uh
counter demonstrators in fact we were I
was supposed to be one of the speakers
nobody could be heard we were rescued
actually by a big State Police
contingent didn't like us but didn't
want people to be killed on the Boston
baham you take a look at the Boston
Globe the next day liberal newspaper
bitterly denouncing the demonstrators
how dare you raise a question about you
know the bombing of North Vietnam uh the
next International Day of protest was uh
March
1966 and we realized we couldn't have a
public demonstration so we arranged it
in a church Arlington Street Church
which is one of the centers of anti-war
activity church was attacked you know
it's that's what the mood was like then
yeah by 1965 I was organizing one of the
people organizing National Tax
resistance and in 1966 we began to
organize a a group called resist still
exists which was uh involved in a
variety of forms of anti-war
resistance in fact we came up for trial
in
1968 I was probably going to face a long
jour sentence but the Ted offensive came
along and the government called off the
trials but it was a pretty serious
involvement for years I was was taking
up a large part of my time and effort I
jack rolls who you yes studied with was
one of the people who supported the
resistance quietly he wasn't wasn't a
person who was much engaged but he did
support
it I I'm mindful that we have limited
time so I've I've got really two
questions I want to ask you really the
first one is um given that you are a
very formed well formed figure in almost
by the time we get to the late 60s what
was your how did you appraise the rise
of the not just the Civil Rights
Movement the 68ers the explosion of
political engagement in the US and
Europe at that time and now looking back
at that you know was how would you
characterize the 68 period and its
impact in your political life well by 68
my feeling it was declining right I was
not overwhelmed At All by the 68 events
I thought they were mostly negative the
Civil Rights movements a different
different case yeah uh it um and its
history is very revealing actually I
went down to the South for
demonstrations and so on but U when you
um say if you listen to the orations on
Martin Luther King
day if you you'll notice that they stop
with his I Have a Dream speech in
Washington uh that's not where Martin
Luther King stopped he then moved on to
class issues and to the north to racism
in the north and to U develop he was
when he was assassinated he was
um he was supporting
a sanitation worker strike and he was
about to organize a Poor People's
movement not on the basis of race Just A
Poor People's movement there was to be a
March on Washington that took place
after his assassination they set up a
tent city in Washington and tried to
appeal for
legislation tent city was smashed up by
the police and they were driven out of
Washington Martin Luther King lost his
liberal support when he turned to class
issues and that part of his life has
kind of disappeared you know it's there
but it's not what's recognized and
that's quite a revealing fact the
northern liberals were perfectly happy
to have him condemn racist sheriffs in
Alabama but not to deal with the issues
of class in the north indeed and this is
in the mid this was shifting in the
mid-60s the anti-war movement had a
different trajectory it was building up
and it did peak in about
6869 uh and uh became a quite a
significant movement in that uh surely
affected the course of the war but by
the' 68 it was being a split yeah and
the move and uh the anti-war movement
itself the student movement was breaking
up
into a maest uh
element U PL you know the progressive of
Labor and u u weathermen which were you
know kind of let's overcome the state by
breaking up wank back windows and so on
and a lot of sectarianism and it was
a it was kind of dissolving in a way
that I thought was
dangerous actually one of the main
movements that developed and the one
that had in the long term the Great
impact on the society was the women's
movement which was just barely beginning
to take off in the late 60s as an
organized movement of course Origins go
way back and then by the 70s was a major
Force yeah I I I make a distinction um
in thinking about the impact of social
movements between those social movements
which are on the one hand egalitarian
but on the other hand they are seeking
in a sense equal access into the system
itself so you could say the civil rights
movement and partly some BR elements of
the women's movement were engaged in
winning equal rights and equal
opportunities and one reason we might
say they were successful and have been
successful in in in certain profound
ways uh is that um you can appeal to the
system to live up to its principles to
ensure as it were equal opportunity to
allow space for the civil rights
movement and the women's movement to to
flourish in contrast with social
movements that come let's say later like
occupy which seek to change the agenda
and the structure as it were of global
financial markets Financial capitalism
American hemony and so on so forth and
there the issue is not access on equal
terms as it were but the transformation
of the organizational principles of the
system and there it's much harder to
have an impact it's harder to change
that agenda an occupy today has is not
the force it it was so I wanted to ask
you now I mean I mean looking back on
your time in public engagement and so on
would you say that was a valid
distinction or not and would you say
looking back that in the
sense um is it it's would you agree that
that the transformation of you know
Western capitalism as we know it and the
structure of financial capitalism is a
much tougher nut to crack then as it
were winning equal opportunities however
important that is as it were within the
structure well I I think the the women's
movement goes beyond seeking equal
opportunities it was also breaking down
uh attitudes deep-seated attitudes that
justified oppression and domination yeah
I agre internalized by the victims
indeed a large part of the women's move
movement was overcoming the
internalization of the sense that you
must be repressed and dominated indeed
so if you ask my grandmother say whether
she was repressed she would not have
known what you're talking about that's
like asking do I breathe you know if you
asked my mother she would know but
didn't think there was anything you
could do about it yes if you asked my
daughter they throw you out of the house
that's a big change that's a huge change
it's a major change women and also in
men's right I think it's it's more than
just equal access as far as the Civil
Rights Movement is concerned it's a it's
it's it's a much more complex issue you
take a look at AF African-American
history there were slaves in
1620 it's a long period uh slavery
formally ended with the Civil War but
about 10 years later it was
reconstituted it was in a different form
it was reconstituted by a the post
reconstruction north south compact which
essentially granted the South the
authority to do what they liked so what
they did was criminalize black life
right
uh if a black man is standing on a
corner he could get a he'd beine $10 for
vagrancy which he couldn't pay' be in
prison forever and so on it created a
new slave labor force a large part of
the American Industrial Revolution was
based on slave labor coming out of the
prisons uh and that lasted U it was not
a small component it was U you know
we're familiar with the chain gangs
that's the agricultural part but it was
mining
steel significant part of uh the
industrial revolution of the late 19th
early 20th century uh it changed at the
time when the second world war came
uh the uh there were there were jobs
there was an immigration to the north
there was plenty of Labor you had then
about 20 or 30 years in which blacks had
relative Freedom a black man could get a
job in the Auto industry um it was
unionized then so you have a fairly
decent job by a home s just kid to
college that sort of thing and the Civil
Rights Movement uh encapsulated that and
formalized some of those rights and
expanded them did give equal rights but
after that it started to return again uh
by now take a look at the by the method
that what what actually happened since
about
19 late 70s primarily since Reagan is uh
re criminalizing black life right uh you
take a look at the incarceration system
uh up until so about 1980 the percentage
of the population that was imprisoned in
the United States is pretty much like
the Western World little on the high end
uh but after that it just zooms up yes
mostly black men by now Hispanic men
some women and it's essentially um
recreating the system that was
constructed in the from in the late 19th
century so so access to free access is
it's true for a small sector but not for
the mass of the black population I mean
these are very important points but
let's take go to occupy yeah let's take
I I I think occupy was a reformist
movement right they were not saying
let's dissolve the financial sector they
were saying things like let's impose a
financial transaction tax right that's
easily accommodated within the existing
institutions in fact it exists in
England uh but but U and occupy was
really a tactic not a movement yeah it
was important but we yeah but it is a
tactic that you can't carry out a tactic
Beyond a certain point well let me put
the question differently to you we we've
just you know lived through one of the
biggest Financial calamities which
nearly push the system off the edge
certainly one of the the biggest since
the Great Depression in a many sense the
burdens of this crisis have been
absorbed taken off the private sector
and absorbed into the public sector and
pushed back onto the relatively immobile
population and higher
taxes um if you ask City Traders today
in London what's changed they will say
very little in other words somewhat as
Mark said the state is a committee for
managing the Affairs of the bourjois and
if there huge cost to Bear they are
passed on to the the movements the the
middle classes and working classes the
labor movement did today is weaker than
it's been for some time the system of
industrial and financial capitalism is
global the rise of Asia as partly their
success in engaging with this economic
system China brings together the you
know two of the greatest ideologies of
the 20th century nationalism and
capitalism into a successful re-entry
into the global order where is the the
spirit of what carries the spir the
spirit of criticism today what carries
the spirit of criticism today of that
complex system that now global system of
capitalism labor movements certainly in
relation to this seem weaker than and
more disorganized than ever before would
you agree with that or not the labor
movement is weaker than it has been but
um you know this is a cyclic pattern
take the United States again there was
quite a powerful labor movement in the
late 19th century early very powerful
was taking over was running cities in
western Pennsylvania and so on very
substantial it was pretty much smashed
by woodro Wilson and the Red Scare in
the postwar postf war period 1920s labor
was essentially Dead uh one of the great
Labor historians David Montgomery has a
book called The I think it's called The
Fall of the House of Labor he's talking
about the
1920s was serious decline 1930s it
revived and it was the uh vital force
that
basically spurred the New Deal
legislation uh CIO organizing sitdown
strikes which are very frightening to
management because they're just a step
before taking over the factory and that
did lead to welfare state legislation of
a significant kind immediately
afterwards there was a business reaction
by the late 1930 it began that's when
you had the movement for scientific
methods of strike breaking and so on it
was put on hold during the war after the
war it started in
force uh strong Taft heartly
1947 huge propaganda efforts to which
are quite astonishing in scale to try to
turn the population against labor labor
made its own mistakes the American labor
movement tried to make uh a compact with
capital will'll work together you know
uh and that compact will be called off
by business as soon as they want to and
the labor movement began its decline at
that point by now in the United States
it's maybe 7% less than 7% of the
private uh of the private
Workforce public sector unions are still
still more protected but they're under
attack but that's happened before and it
could revive again and in fact it is
Reviving again in an interesting way so
if you go to uh there's
a in the old Rust Belt say Northern Ohio
Indiana uh there's a Revival of
something new a worker owned
Enterprises uh so take youngst take
Youngstown Ohio major steel town uh in
1977 or so the uh us steel decided to
close down the its Youngstown
Enterprises this is a town that was
built by the labor movement all
surrounding the steel with all the
everything that proliferates from it and
so on uh the union wanted to buy the
steel company and take it over the steel
Executives didn't want to do it went to
the courts Union lost but they didn't
give up they move towards smallscale
worker-owned Enterprises which are now
proliferating in Northern Ohio that's a
possible germ of an alternative form of
U
uh of organization and activism which
actually has a re revolutionary
potential it changes the structure of
the system if it can succeed that's one
kind of development uh if you look
around say the 's take say college
students that sector of the population
uh they're much more politically engaged
now than they ever have
been except for there was a very brief
period late
1960s when there was a lot of student
activism of a mixed kind but now it's
much broader environmental issues
women's issues solidarity movements
they're not uh there's nothing kind of
coordinated you know there's no movement
you can point to but uh a lot of ferment
uh a lot of opposition to the
corporatization of the universities the
uh many things happening it could
coalescent to something let me finish by
asking you this question we one way to
put it would be what keeps you awake at
night you know what keeps you awake at
night would be one way to put the my
last question to you but another way to
put it would be how would you
characterize today the dimensions of
your engagements in the public domain
what are your
priorities and uh how would you sketch
that I mean there are plenty of problems
but there are two that are absolutely
overwhelming one of them goes back to
August 6th
1945 we're still living under the shadow
of potential
self-destruction and if you take a look
at that record it is
horrendous it's a miracle that we've
survived anyone who looks closely at the
record of near nuclear war very near
minutes is
shocking uh and that's still there in
fact it's it's growing but the other
which
U we weren't really aware of until the
1970s is is the threat of environmental
disaster which is an overwhelming threat
I'm really at a point in human history
where we have to decide are we going to
destroy the prospects for decent
existence that's never happened before
indeed and it's very close uh everything
else kind of Fades into the background
uh in the face of these two kind of
overwhelming dangers are there grounds
for optimism
well
I I like to think of my favorite comment
from the analects
confucious there's a definition there of
the exemplary person presumably the
master himself it's the person who keeps
on trying even though he knows there is
no hope I don't think it's quite that
bad there isn't much hope there's some
we have to keep on trying n jsky thank
you very
much
