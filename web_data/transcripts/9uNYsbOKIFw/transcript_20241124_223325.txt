well again I want to say a few things
about uh two crucially important
Concepts uh capitalism
democracy uh which are have interesting
relations uh notably the relation of
contradiction and I want to talk a
little about their
prospects uh actually I'm not going to
talk about capitalism democracy
contrary to what I just said but rather
about what we might call really existing
capitalist democracy which is something
quite different it's different from
capitalism different from
democracy uh Rec
[Music]
CD is the
acronym pronounced wrecked for short
which is a good name for it uh so let me
talk about those and about their
prospects uh the first of all the
difference
between capitalist democracy and really
existing capitalist democracy goes back
to the first days of the founding of the
Republic uh as uh the colonies were
moving towards independence they did get
advice from the leading economists of
the day from Adam Smith in fact about
the policies that they should pursue and
Adam Smith's advice was should be
familiar to us it's approximately the
same advice that's handed out today uh
it's uh the principle they should he
advised that the colonies should follow
what's called sound
economics uh they should have free
market principles which means that the
colonies should produce uh do what
they're good at uh was an agricultural
country they should uh produce
agricultural Goods later that was called
their comparative advantage uh cotton
fur fish send them to the industrial
centers in England and they should
import industrial goods from England
which are much more
advanced uh and then the argument is
everybody uh
benefits uh the colonies were
independent and therefore they could
make choices and they CH there was
actually a division like Thomas
Jefferson would have agreed to this he
was a slave owning
Aristocrat luxurious lifestyle based on
uh agricultural production with slaves
he probably would have accepted it but
American Economic Policy was actually
formulated by Alexander Hamilton came
from a different background uh poor
background in fact and he uh made the
decis a fateful decision he decided to
reject sound economics reject capitalism
and to follow the path that England had
followed uh which was not free markets
and not capitalism rather to introduce a
developmental State extensive State
intervention so we immediately moved
towards establishing very high
protective tariffs to keep out Superior
British goods that just as Britain had
instituted High tariffs and other means
to keep out Superior Indian uh Goods
goods from the low countries and so on
uh the United States in fact became what
one leading Economist economic historian
calls the mother country and Bastion of
protectionism and stayed that way until
the second world war very high tariffs
uh by the time we get to the second
world war the United States was so far
in advance of every other country uh
most of the world has been devastated by
the war the United States gained
enormously from it uh that it seemed
that free trade might be a possible idea
that followed England's policy in a
century earlier England had about twice
the per capita capitalization of other
countries so they figured okay maybe
we'll have a little experiment with li
fair if you're way ahead of everyone
else then free market sound like a good
idea because you're going to win in the
competition but just like England the
United States imposed very severe
restrictions after the second world war
as Britain had done but there was a move
for the first up until then there was
not much pretense of being a market
Society uh the uh protective tariffs
enabled the United States to and other
measures to set up a textile industry
that was the first stage in
industrialization later in the century a
steel industry barring Superior British
Goods just as Britain had barred
Superior Indian steel uh and uh Andrew
Carnegie developed the first billion
doll
Corporation around 1900 thanks to first
of all very high protective tariffs
which uh kept out Superior British goods
uh uh uh procurement by the state it's a
major form of public subsidy it was a
great pass IST got huge contracts from
the Navy uh which was a great subsidy
and also just by Straight violence so he
uh the
major What's called the biggest strike
in American history at Homestead
Pennsylvania was a strike by the Iron
and steel workers which was smashed by
uh the Carnegie Corporation first they
called in Pinkerton later the National
Guard which destroyed it wasn't actually
a strike it was a lockout the Carnegie
Corporation announced that no union
worker would be permitted to have a job
so if workers wanted to have a job that
to apply individually that led to a a
walk out and then the violence which not
only destroyed the union but also the
town and the region which was work
around and worker run it was kind of a
workers Republic it was a major event
almost that strike lock out uh and and
uh at the same time uh of course the
there were other major Market
interventions aren't called that by
economists but uh cotton
was which was like oil the oil of the it
was the oil of the 19th century fueled
the Industrial Revolution now that was
not based on Market principles it was
based on slavery is kind of a pretty
severe interference with the market
Market uh extermination of the native
population was pretty remote from Market
principles but was a prerequisite for
developing an advanced economy those are
the two major features of American
history and it's worth remembering that
uh slavery almost never ended uh slavery
was officially ended after the second
first after the Civil War and it lasted
for about 10 years after that there was
a north south compact which permitted um
the former slave states to uh
criminalize black life which is
essentially what they did and like if a
black man was standing on a street
corner he could be charged with vagrancy
if he looked the wrong way somebody's
claimed that a white woman he could be
charged with attempted rape and uh
pretty soon they had most of the black
male population back in jail perfect
labor force much better than slavery in
the case of slavery you have you own the
capital and you have to maintain it in
the case of
criminalization uh the state maintains
the capital you just get it free and a
large part of the American Industrial
Revolution was based on that that
actually lasted until the second world
war when there was a need for what was
called Free Labor then you had a couple
of Decades of relative opportunities for
African-Americans that ended around
1980 with Reagan's racist drug war aimed
at the black population mainly black
male population by now we're back to
criminalization of the uh
of black life you take a look at the 500
years since the first slaves came
there've been about three or four
Decades of relative opportunities for
African-American Americans it's interest
crucial part of our history just as
virtual extermination of the indigenous
population is very severe Market uh
restrictions won't go through the rest
of the story but uh continues without a
break uh after the second world war
there was a huge increase in state
intervention in the economy most of the
modern economy the Hightech economy was
developed in places like MIT under
government uh funding mostly Pentagon
funding
uh by the time you get to the Reagan
years about a third of research and
development was uh Pentagon funded and
of about 2third of the research and
development that were risky and creative
were Pentagon funded the way the the
whole I Revolution is based on that
computers internet
microelectronics
satellites almost without exception
comes from Decades of research and
development primarily in the state
sector uh the way the system works is
the public pays the costs usually under
some pretext like we're defending
ourselves from the Russians or the
Martians or someone uh the public pays
the costs for decades r risky creative
work and when something comes out of it
it's handed over to private Enterprise
for marketing and profit and notice this
is radically anti capitalist in a
capitalist system if you make a an
investment especially a risky and
long-term investment and after maybe 30
years something comes out that can make
a profit you're supposed to make the
profit but that's not the way our system
works the public pays the costs for the
risky difficult creative partk and Bill
Gates and Steve Jobs Market it and make
the profit that you can hardly imagine
anything more radically anti- capitalist
in the modern period it's gotten even
more extreme since the 1970s as you know
the economy's become very increasingly
uh uh dependent on financial
institutions by right before the last
crash almost half of corporate profits
were coming from financial
institutions and when I say they're
profits you have to add a
qualification the international monetary
fund recently did a study of the six
major US Banks you know JP Morgan Chase
Bank of America and so on and uh try to
estimate where their profits come from
they concluded that virtually all their
profits come from a government insurance
policy
it's called informally too big to fail
that includes not only the bailouts
which are famous but much more so they
get cheap credit uh they get ad they get
credit ratings from the Credit Agencies
which are inflated because the agencies
know that if they get into trouble The
public's going to bail them out uh the
business press Bloomberg News tried to
estimate the total amount of this and
they came up with a figure of about $83
billion a year of public subsidy to the
big Banks that's just the biggest banks
extended over the whole financial system
it's even more I mean again it's hard to
think of more extreme uh uh extreme
uh attacks on essential uh basic
principles of capitalism now there are
alternatives possible and they're
interesting and important ones quite
alive in fact so for example I'm talked
about us steel billion dollar
Corporation by the late 70s the American
steel industry was was moving towards
financialization offshoring and so on
and they began to shut down facilities
the biggest one of the biggest ones is
Youngstown
Pennsylvania major steel Town Ohio major
steel town the town was built by the
union and this the workers in the steel
industry and uh the US steel decided to
shut it down uh the uh workers and the
community made an effort to buy the
plant have it worker owned uh which
probably would have been profitable for
the
corporation but the standard procedure
is for big multinationals to reject
profitable initiatives for worker take
over for class for reasons of class
Consciousness it's dangerous to allow
working people to take over the plant
you go back to Homestead when uh
Carnegie called in the National Guard to
smash up the workers movement one of the
one of the charges against the workers
was that workers were running the plant
and not taking orders for management and
that's dangerous might be profitable but
it's very dangerous for pretty obvious
reasons that's why uh during s CIO
organizing in the 30s when the CIA
started moving to sit down strikes uh
the corporations really got worried and
you know New Deal reform started getting
instituted sitdown strikes are just one
step before taking over the factory
kicking out the managers and saying
goodbye we'll run it ourselves that's
serious and we have a very high uh class
cont ious business Community different
from any other country in the world it's
one of the reasons why there's been such
a violent and severe anti- labor history
quite different from other countries
Britain Australia others uh the
uh when the Youngstown workers offered
to take over the to buy the Enterprises
us steel refused finally went to the
courts and U the steel companies
prevailed they were not permitted to buy
it the industries were destroyed uh but
they didn't give up at that point uh the
working the workers in Youngstown and
the communities began to look for
Alternatives and they began to
develop what's by now a fairly
substantial network of worker owned
Enterprises around Cleveland Northern
Ohio that some of them are fairly
substantial uh working into the uh
public sector institutions that were
around like universities and research
institutes and so on that's an option
which is possible and it could be a
major option so for example you remember
a couple of years ago uh Obama basically
took over the Auto industry it was
collapsing so the public rescued it the
usual technique uh but the public really
pretty much owned the industry at one
point and there were options the option
that was taken was to essentially re pay
the costs turn it back to the original
owners maybe some different faces but
basically the class of the original
owners uh and have it continue to
produce what it had been producing uh
automobiles there were Alternatives one
alternative was to turn it over to the
workforce uh have them run it the way
they run the homestead plan back in
1890 uh and have it produce the things
that the country needs like highspeed
rail which is much more important than
uh
more cars in the street if any of you
drove here this evening you know the
reason why uh but uh that option was not
taken was not considered and that's
basically our fault uh to that option
could be considered if you had something
like the mood and attitudes or around
Youngtown in the late' 70s or around
Homestead Pennsylvania in the late '90s
period of the most uh
extreme steps towards democracy in
American history were right about that
time the farm it was mostly an
agricultural country the farmers
Alliance based in Texas and spreading to
Kansas other such places was a movement
of radical Farmers with very uh
far-reaching
goals uh take over eliminate the banks
the northeastern Banks run them
themselves cooperatives marketing
cooperatives and so on they were finally
smashed by force by force that's crucial
part of American History they were
trying to link up with the Knights of
Labor major huge labor organization
which had again pretty radical
objectives one of their slogans was that
those who own the Mills ought to run
usual undercurrent sometimes major
current of Labor struggles why should we
have managers we can run it by ourselves
why have owners why not take it over
that's the great fear of uh really
existing capitalism that the work class
might take over the uh uh industrial
system the general system and run it
themselves Farmers Alliance was
destroyed by force uh the Knights of
Labor were destroyed by force there was
a uh uh by the there was a during the
Progressive period early 20th century
they were sort of reforms but they were
constrained they were not going to
permit labor
organization by the 1920s labor movement
had been virtually
smashed a major work by uh one of the
leading labor historians David
Montgomery called the The Fall of the
House House of Labor he's talking about
the 1920s did resurrect in the 30s but
then the Counterattack started right
away and you know what the situation is
now well that uh is the D part of wreck
what about democracy it's uh the public
is not sufficiently organized and active
to permit these things to happen the
existing alternatives to be implemented
on a large scale and that can change uh
the
[Music]
late 19th century is an example the
1930s the resurrection of the labor
movement which spearheaded the New Deal
reforms as an example and it uh can
happen again but these things don't
happen by themselves well a couple of
words about the prospects uh what are
the prospects for
wrecked uh pretty dim actually it's
predictable that the existing
institutions the existing institutional
structure of really existing capitalist
democracy are going to
self-destruct almost inevitable there
are two major uh factors that should be
right at the Forefront of our attention
uh which uh uh indicate why that's going
to happen one of them is environmental
catastrophe uh environmental catastrophe
is a predict able consequence of
existing
institutions uh so
say anyone who's literate knows at this
point or should know that uh unless most
of the fossil fuels maybe 80% are left
in the ground we're essentially
doomed uh at the same time the energy
corporations are doing everything they
can to extract every last drop of oil
from the ground Exxon Mobile the major
one recently announced that uh it's
going to focus uh laser like the word
that the business press used for it
Focus laser like on maximizing fossil
fuel use because it's so profitable
Chevron another major energy corporation
had a small sustainable energy program
probably mostly for PR reasons they
recently announced that they're closing
it down even though it's profitable the
reason is that fossil fuels are much
more profitable and so it is across the
board you can't criticize the CEOs of
the energy corporations for doing this
this is actually their legal obligation
their legal obligation is to maximize
profit for shareholders and of course
huge bonuses for themselves which is
designed by state power but that's
something on the side uh if they don't
do it they'll be replaced by someone
else who will do it it's institutional
logic uh that to the extent that we have
to an extent there is a capitalist
market system and to that extent it's
sufficient to drive the society towards
destruction and you don't have to look
for to see it take this morning's
newspapers if you had a chance to look
at them uh the New York York Times this
morning has a front page story on the
Australian heat wave a huge heat wave in
Australia last summer uh it's been
carefully studied by uh climate
scientists uh pursuing various models of
climate change there was a report today
showing that all of the models no matter
what how they were based came with the
same conclusion that there's no possible
way for this heat wve to have develop V
except through global warming it's one
of the first cases where a specific uh
climate disaster can be traced very
clearly to what's plainly happening uh
that's the New York Times the Boston
Globe had a front page story their lead
story on the fact that Boston is
predicted to be under seven or eight
feet of water by the end of the
century couple of feet maybe two or
three 3 ft in 20 years or so and they're
very discussed various plans to do
something about it so like turning
downtown Boston and some like Venice
replacing the streets by canals so you
can replace your cars by canoes or
something and uh uh it pointed out that
the process is irreversible so we might
as well be trying to face it somehow
well that is and of course that's the
north when you go to uh say Bangladesh
Coastal plan that means tens of millions
of people get wiped out uh this is it's
clearly coming everyone can see it it's
based on the logic of our
institutions uh and uh unless there's
significant change uh and not in the
distant future the prospects look pretty
dim well all of that should be pretty
obvious to everyone on fortunately it
isn't but it should be and major efforts
have to be made to make it obvious but
there's something else which is equally
dangerous maybe even more so which is
much less disgusted and that's the
threat of nuclear war uh if you look
over the
history of U nuclear interactions it's a
miracle that we've survived literally
there's been case after case where we
came within a hairs breadth of a nuclear
war that would have wiped
out organized life on Earth that's what
happens these if there's a major nuclear
war so just to mention one case which
leads right up to the present there's
many but uh in the early 1980s when the
Reagan Administration came in one of
their first policies was to try to probe
Russian air and Naval defenses by
simulated nuclear attacks to try to
elicit a response and to see what they
could learn about uh what you know what
the Russian preparations were so they
simulated attacks nuclear attacks on on
Russia by sea and by air well they were
designed so the Russians could pick them
up otherwise there's no point they
wanted to find out the reaction well
they did pick them up Russia happens to
be pretty vulnerable and they were wor
about it it was known this was remember
at a very tense period uh the Reagan
Administration was just placing ping two
missiles in Western Europe which have a
few minutes flight time to Moscow that's
kind of dangerous there nuclear missiles
of course uh and turn it was known at
the time that the Russians were kind of
worried recent Revelations from the
Russian archives have shown that they
were extremely concerned that they
thought that a major nuclear attack was
imminent and were reading themselves for
a an a preemptive response which would
have wiped out the United States
basically actually there are recent
Studies by the intelligence Community
warning saying that the war scare was
for real it wasn't a joke well right in
the midst of all of this uh the Russian
Auto we've recently learned the Russian
automated response systems they have
just like we do there's a much worse no
doubt and IRS make plenty of Errors
which are aborted by human intervention
uh the their systems provided warnings
of a certain a nuclear attack that was
underway the protocol is for the
automated
uh evidence to be handed over to the
military command who will then launch a
a preemptive or maybe at that point
reactive nuclear attack uh there was
it's handed over by a human being a man
whose name was stanislav Petr he just
decided not to turn it over that's why
we're here today to talk about it
literally one Russian technician decided
disobey
orders and we're alive to talk about it
that's one incident of many well a
couple years after that uh the Berlin
Wall fell Soviet Union collapsed
and a very critical period in American
history took place for 50 years uh NATO
had been established on the principle
that it had to defend Western Europe
from the Russian hordes okay now no more
Russian hordes so what happens to Nato
well if You' believed any of the
propaganda of the past 50 years NATO
should have dissolved it didn't it
expanded it expanded to become U
essentially the US intervention force it
has now an official mandate not to
protect us from the Russians an official
mandate to control the global Energy
System the sea lanes and pipelines and
to intervene wherever the master in
Washington orders it to intervene which
has happened over and over that's
native uh the uh the the Gorbachev
Russian leader at the time made an
astonishing offer he offered to allow
Germany to be
unified and to join a hostile military
Alliance NATO if you look at the history
of the recent years you can see how
astonishing that offer was I mean
Germany alone had virtually destroyed
Russia several times with tens of
millions of people killed huge casual
when Russia was more or less backed by
the West uh now he was saying Germany
can join a hostile military Alliance and
be
remilitarized there was a condition qu
proquo the condition was is the phrasing
was that NATO would not expand one inch
to the east that meant to East Germany
NATO would not move to East Germany that
was the condition there was an agreement
between gorbage and President Bush and
James Baker Secretary of State uh
immediately NATO was expanded to the
east to East Germany gorbachov was of
course infuriated but he was informed by
Washington that it was just a
gentleman's agreement there was nothing
on paper so we had no basis for
complaint they didn't say it but means
if you're stupid enough to accept our
word that's your problem uh then Clinton
comes in and expands NATO to the whole
Eastern European region bordering on
Russia Russians are a little unhappy
about that just as if say the Warsaw PCT
were to take over Canada and Mexico
might not like it in fact very quickly
be a nuclear war if there was even a
hint of that now uh NATO is threatening
to move to the Ukraine that's the
heartland of the Russian system
not only long historic connections but
from a strategic point of view
inconceivable that any Russian leader
would accept it certainly that's not
just my view you can read in the major
establishment Journal Foreign Affairs
their lead
article this this month is uh by
wellknown international relations
specialist John mimer the headline title
is something like the West is
responsible for the Ukraine crisis and
what he describes is essentially this
efforts to move Western power meaning us
power right to the heartland of Russian
strategic concerns is almost is
guaranteed to elicit a strong Russian
response just independently of who's
running the place is run by Gandhi
they'd have the same reaction well that
it's uh it's leading to the threat of a
nuclear
confrontation and uh to make it clearer
the not only the rhetoric but the
actions in the west are pressing in that
direction the Russians also so Obama who
came into office you remember if you
have can remember a couple of years ago
as a a peace candidate who was going to
move towards elimination of nuclear
weapons they recently announced that a
trillion dollar program trillion dollars
to upgrade and modernize uh US nuclear
weapons forces uh Russians notice that
notice that we're encroaching right into
the core strategic areas for them that's
playing with fire uh and uh you can't be
certain that there'll be a stanislav
Petro to save our skins next time well
those are the and all of this deres
directly from the logic of institutions
in really existing capitalist democracy
the state is dedicated to maximizing its
power and the power the welfare of its
primary constituents corporate sector
it's no secret uh you read international
relations Theory you learn a principle
that uh states are committed to
security what is not asked is security
for whom it's certainly not security for
the population as even these few
examples illustrate that's obviously the
case it is security it's security for
state power and for the primary
constituency of state power private
concentrated wealth and that logic is
driving us
towards situation where the destruction
is not unlikely and increasingly likely
well those are the prospects were
wrecked and they cannot be permitted to
uh persist just for the even for the
decent survival of the species stop
[Music]
there I think we
