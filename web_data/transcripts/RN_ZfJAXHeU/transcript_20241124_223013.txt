hi i'm paul jay welcome to the
analysis.news
very special edition of the
analysis.news coming up
noam chomsky and daniel ellsberg be back
in just a second
in my mind
two of the most important public
intellectuals in the world
noam chomsky and daniel ellsberg
join me today
in 1971 daniel ellsberg risked a
lifetime in jail when he leaked the
classified pentagon papers to the news
media exposing the lies of the u.s
government about the vietnam war has now
come out as the possible source of the
times pentagon document it is that of
daniel ellsberg the top policy analyst
for the defense and state department
prepared to answer to all the
consequences
of these decisions
at the time of ellsberg's prosecution
noam chomsky was asked to comment
dan ellsberg released to the american
people information historical
information
about
how a series of presidents enmeshed them
in a vicious and costly war of
aggression now 51 years later chomsky
and ellsberg both in their 90s are still
tirelessly fighting to warn the people
of the world about the existential
dangers of nuclear war and climate
change then join me today on the
analysis dot news um i asked both
gentlemen if they might have a question
for each other and gnome has a question
for dan so go ahead no
well my question to dan
is
one i've
had in mind for a long time
how can you look so cheerful
when you know so much about
the horrible things that are going on in
the world
well actually
it's almost a tick of mine
it's a very long
when i'm in a situation which i have
been not infrequently whether in vietnam
or in dc or rant here
when the is really coming down
i laugh i don't know and i can't explain
it and it's very uh
very puzzling to a lot of people how can
you be laughing at this time and the
more horrible things are uh it's just a
reaction that i have so that's the uh
that's the answer to you i
it's not that i don't uh smile at all
when things are going all right but uh
when i'm looking this cheerful
it's kind of a barometer
[Music]
it's not entirely it shouldn't be
reassuring to people who know me
how about you i know there's not a lot
to be optimistic about gnome
uh but you don't stop fighting you're
doing it seems to me you're doing more
interviews these days than than even a
year ago it's like you're upping your
game
what what keeps you going gnome
the situation
becomes
more serious
more dire
more urgent
there are lots of people mostly young
people
who are doing
courageous important work i
unfortunately just can't join them
anymore i'm
not up to it physically
the least i can do is
try to do what i can talk about it
you've been uh doing wonderful work uh
gnome these interviews you do regularly
with cj polychroniol i learned a lot
from them i just read another one today
on the uh the challenge that our empire
sees from china the alleged rise of
china extremely good interview but
they're all uh they're all good and i'm
very impressed that you keep turning
those out so so fast just when they're
needed that's wonderful
so so no
in terms of where we're at right now
there's a negotiations going on now for
the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty in new
york
um it looks like not much is going to
come out of that if if anything in fact
there seems to be no real negotiations
going on at all
about any kind of uh reduction in
nuclear weapons
uh
what what's your knowing what's your
take on just how dire this moment is you
use the word dire so explain dire
well i don't think there should be much
need to
elaborate on the
dire situation
uh right now
in ukraine
uh
a nuclear power plant has has just been
shut down today
but its situ situation is very dangerous
there's three or four others
they could easily be attacked by
rockets by terrorbird could lead to a
horrendous disaster
furthermore it's all too easy to
think of scenarios
that would lead us up the escalation
ladder
as dan has
made very clear long ago we should all
understand
there's no stopping no sensible stopping
point you step on the ladder you keep
going up to the doom state clock
i don't think i even have to run through
them i see inadvertently
one was mentioned incidentally in the
long washington post
article a couple of days ago
giving discussing in detail the
us version of the background for the
ukraine war
and in it they happened to mention
incidentally
quoted a british military official
who said the u.s and britain were kind
of surprised at the russian attack
they didn't attack using the u.s british
methods
namely total war in which you destroy
everything
destroy the communication system the
energy system
uh
shock and awe how come the russians
aren't doing that well
we're going to kiev is functioning
we can ask why they're not doing it but
they certainly can
if the war goes on
they're very likely to
that could
quickly lead a lot of other things
fortunately the pentagon has been which
seems to be the one
peacekeeping force in the u.s government
at this point
has been vetoing
some of the more
extreme proposals
like a no-fly zone
which means
destroying
russian
anti-aircraft facilities which are in
russia
what happens then
escalate to
more attacks on
i mean there are actually proposals in
the wall street journal and elsewhere
even in
peace journals that we should be
accompanying uh ships naval vessels
should be accompanying ships that break
the
russian blockade well what does that
mean
it means you get into
an attack
then where do you go
i mean it takes no imagination to think
of
how this could escalate
and the most important thing
about that washington long washington
post article
is there it's all about how to conduct
the war
nothing about how to end the war which
is of course the most important issue
not a word
like not a word
saying that a couple of weeks before the
war
the russian foreign minister lavrov said
the sole issue
is
uh ukraine joining nato
well
did he mean it
the only one way to find out
take him up on it
let's try and see if there's a
possibility
uh actually that's been what
high u.s officials with
any familiarity with the sewage soviet
union have been saying for 30 years it's
just it's
too risky and provocative to expand nato
to the russian border and certainly not
to move to ukraine which
every high official you can think of
cia director
robert gates
hawkish defense secretary of bush said
that's just going to lead the ward
no surprise you know
keep doing it
let's see
maybe we'll be lucky i mean take a look
at the official u.s policy
official policy
we have to fight the war in order to
weaken russia
so severely
that it will never be able to undertake
aggression again
i mean think for
30 seconds
what does that mean
means we have to weaken
russia
beyond
what germany was weakened
with how germany was weakened at the
very side treaty because that wasn't
enough to stop them from carrying out
aggression
so what does it mean that we turn russia
into an agrarian society
something like the morgenthal plan
meanwhile the russians kind of stand by
and say
this is kind of fun let's uh let's see
how far it goes
i mean
it's a lunatic world
lunatic
this and now let's go to the npt
conference
probably get barely recorded
will anybody report the fact that the
nuclear powers including the united
states are violating it all the time
i mean
we all know what it says
article six
nuclear powers will take good faith
measures to uh
end
the scourge of nuclear weapons in the
world see anybody doing
actually you
circulated force an article
interesting article
with guardian which pointed out that the
arms control regime is is
languishing
it's not exactly correct
the arms control regime has been
virtually destroyed
by the republican party
first george w bush
eliminating the
apm treaty very serious
serious threat to russia among other
things then you get to trump who's
wielding his wrecking ball attacking
everything you can see
inf treaty
reagan gorbachev treaty which
didn't
lead to a reduction of serious tensions
in europe
get rid of that
get rid of the open skies treaty goes
back to eisenhower
uh it's not just languishing
i mean he came very close
trump
to eliminating the last serious treaty
the new start treaty
fortunately he
biden came into office
able to
accept the russian offers to continue it
by a couple of days
so it's not just languishing it's being
determined shreds it goes beyond
today for example
the
head of mossad israeli muslim
had a
major talk in which she said
the iran treaty is totally unacceptable
we're going to use whatever means
we have to undermine it
what does that mean
we talk about
how iran
did not live up to the
treaty which happens to be true
after the united states eliminated it
and totally disregarded them
okay after that they began to do the
same
uh is that an argument against renewing
the treaty
in fact
i don't want to talk too long but let me
just go on one step
everybody knows
how to deal with the alleged threat
of iranian nuclear weapons
impose a nuclear weapons piece of free
zone in the middle east
with inspections now we know that they
work
u.s intelligence confirmed that iran was
living up to the
joint agreement the jcpoa
so there's a simple solution
why not institute
who's against it
he ran strongly in favor of it
regional states been pressing forward
for 25 years
the whole global south is strongly in
favor of it now europe isn't imposing
any objections
one country is vetoing it
the united states do you see that in the
headlines
of course israel supposed
well we can go into why the united
states is blocking it but everybody
knows even though they don't say
it would jeopardize
us aid israel
if the united states doesn't even
recognize that israel has nuclear
weapons
of course it has
if you recognize it
u.s law comes into play
which raised to serious questions about
whether any usaid israel is even legal
under u.s law
well nobody wants to open that door so
we don't do what we can easily do
to
end any alleged threat of iran written
instead of that we talk about iranian
violations iranian terror
one thing or another
there is an
international treaty now
treaty for again prohibition of
production of nuclear weapons well the
nuclear states haven't signed
about 100 others said
could we make a first step
and saying well let's move towards
thinking about signing in no we couldn't
that would be a step forward
lots of possibilities which is not being
discussed just as negotiations to end
the war in iraq and ukraine only
sensible policy
not even discussed
no effort to try just war war
violence let's see how far we can go and
maybe by some miracle we won't destroy
ourselves
dan
paul i'm
i'm glad that you asked the question
earlier or no is the question why am i
smiling through all this i i see that i
am smiling i can see it on the screen
uh i explained
that when things look
just impossible to get through when it's
things are terrible when there's a
shitstorm total shitstorm i have this
reflexive tick of laughing and smiling
and what we've just heard from gnome i
think explains why
that perhaps it's a hysterical reaction
why that's sitting in right now
gnome has described the situation very
well he mentioned by the way that uh
just an hour ago today as we speak
the japarizia plant
uh nuclear plant artists in europe
has been disconnected from the european
grid for the first time in its history
because of fires that uh the russians
say were set by ukrainian artillery uh
with the ukrainians uh whether they they
they are or are not firing on japanese
uh not surprising since they're
if they were
given that they are human and they act
like other uh nation states have acted
they're being fired on uh as i
understand it from japarizia so both
sides in other words are playing this
nuclear chicken in effect um of uh
gambling with the future of in the case
of jacaritzia the whole region
enormously subject to radioactivity
worse than chernobyl or three mile
island
and uh
both sides by the way say oh yeah we
welcome inspection by the iaea but
there's still negotiated on as far as i
know it hasn't happened yet
to get people out of there i signed a
petition the other day uh
literally
uh to
for the u.n for the npt conference to
call on
all nuclear radio reactor sites to be
free zones in effect no
uh stationing of troops nearby no firing
nearby no combat for 30 kilometers they
say and so forth uh yes the npt
conference could speak on that but as i
understand it they're not proposing to
address the ukrainian situation at all
despite their nuclear threats they're
being made directly in that and they
could even look forward
to taiwan uh as an issue uh
when they're uh but they're not going to
address these actual threats at all
uh i understand that the speaking of the
npt conference that gnome did
a non-proliferation treaty review
conference
which ends tomorrow i believe for the
first time
in the review conferences
there has been a draft proposal
uh in line with what the u.n secretary
gutierrez has called for during this
conference and that is that the nuclear
states
commit themselves not to initiate
nuclear war and no first use commitment
and uh this draft proposal or just about
a week ago which i read actually
incorporates that i mean
some people were celebrating that as the
first time that it happened i didn't
celebrate excellent because i think the
chance that the final documents will
incorporate that commitment or even call
on the nuclear states never to initiate
nuclear war never first use
the chance of that being in the final
document i see
is zero
now in a way
nothing is zero when i think things are
certain uh they happen sometimes
sometimes that's very fortunate
and we were miracles happen like the
berlin wall coming down or nelson
mandela uh coming to power without a
violent revolution in south africa and
so miracles happen and that's what we
need in effect is a miracle of that sort
but i don't think it's we're going to
see it tomorrow the usefulness of saying
i'm certain
they will not uh commit themselves to no
first use tomorrow
is that if they do it
i'm clearly wrong
and that's useful i can then say my
whole framework here is wrong i've got
to reconsider it and actually i i
welcome that when it happens and i learn
from it
nevertheless
it's bad news uh unless unless it does
happen the reason i'm sure that it won't
uh is that
our foreign policy
since nato uh began
in the late 40s
say 47 it began but in particular since
its doctrine evolved in the early 50s
has been based on the threat or the
insurance to our allies
of initiating nuclear war
against what was a nuclear state since
1949 uh the soviet union so from its
very beginning
then nato has been founded in u.s
foreign policy beyond nato
has been foreign policy has been on our
threat
carried out by our
preparations our readiness our
deployment our exercises our
development of weapons
to initiate nuclear war against the
nuclear weapons state which
even
in the smallest aspect which could arise
uh any time now in ukraine
uh portland is actually threatening that
if nato becomes more directly involved
obviously nato is involved
but could be
could be more
people have been pressing for u.s air
to be directly uh in a no-fly zone for
example zielinski was calling for that
early on
and others
that would mean nato direct combat with
uh with russia
and pokemon is and which by the way
could confront the russians with a
clear-cut military defeat
locally in
ukraine
and if they're pushing them back even
before the february 24th
control zone that they haven't done
before it's here
in that case putin has definitely
indicated that nuclear war is possible
he has more than a thousand tactical
nuclear weapons small nuclear weapons of
the kind we've been uh moving forward
uh
renewing uh for some time
yes there could be even a small one then
would be virtual extermination of
ukraine of ukrainians but it would also
be highly likely to escalate and that
means
not extinction actually
but near extinction
not even so near let's remove that word
the latest report
uh on this uh publicized i think it was
a nature magazine a peer-reviewed
article by uh i'm a robot a number of
others
the first time i think gives a lower
figure
or what would come from nuclear winter
from a next full large exchange between
the us and russia
uh we haven't seen i don't think uh
figures like that before and the figure
is more than five billion people more
than five billion people
now
that's you could say good news say it's
six billion
well that leaves two billion people uh
edward teller would say well that's the
glass uh a quarter full
uh to bringing people around but um
it would be murder on a scale
for simply we don't have any words any
concepts for it and language and that's
what
we are budgeting
preparing for
and russia also and other countries
modernizing their abilities and trigger
this sort of thing
preparing it exercising to kill
let's say three quarters of the human
population on earth
right now now
no one is saying really
what gives any power what gives the
united states
or russia
or ever has the right
to make hostages
of billions of people
remember what this is more than five
billion
i looked up the other day the number of
armed forces in all the world right now
it's 1 billion
and 100 million actually pretty much
a billion
so three quarters or more of those
people killed would be civilians women
chill infants
uh yes they would be left
people in a ravaged world
um as for the climate change but uh
this murder of as i say uh
mostly civilians
no war now with nuclear weapons even the
smallest
will be contained within the territory
victims will not be contained within the
territory of the adversaries
aside from the fact that most of the
adversarial people will be civilians uh
anything but no such wall will be
contained within that territory most of
the people most of the people in a
nuclear war
will be outside the territorial
boundaries of the um
adversarial states
and that includes with nuclear winter
the southern hemisphere even without a
single warhead landing down there
unlike radioactivity which is pretty
much confined by winds equatorial winds
into the hemisphere where the warheads
land
the smoke from the burning cities would
be lofted into the high stratosphere
where it would
not rain out and go around the globe
very quickly within days and destroy
separate out
that has blocked
most of the sunlight perhaps 70 of the
sunlight for years up to a decade
killing all harvests worldwide all
hemispheres everywhere
so that within months
or a year or two at the most
nearly everyone would starve to tear
i come back to the point we have a
non-proliferation treaty renewal
conference now
somewhat discussing
and rejecting
the idea
that it should be a rule
of international original
human
survival that no one should trigger
and that really means no one should
threaten it and prepare for it which is
what we're doing
people take some heart from the fact
that uh even donald trump uh i think
under trump but at any rate under biden
certainly and putin
have renewed the commitment or the
assertion that reagan and gorbachev made
40 years ago
that nuclear war cannot be won
and must not be fought
but since in the 40 years since they
said that of course
here we are building up or preparing for
nuclear war and making it on an air
trigger on both sides by the way the
icbms that are vulnerable to the others
icbms are on a 10-minute alert on both
sides and subject to false alarms which
confront the leaders with using them or
losing them within minutes only the
icbms do that
and yet we have just in this country uh
budgeted
for a whole new set of icbms projecting
this series the sequence into the future
which should have ended 50 years ago
even from a cold war point of view where
nuclear submarines came into both sides
sufficient to cause nuclear wear by
themselves
and the icbms the vulnerable icbms which
pose this 10-minute hair trigger problem
uh were anachronistic and dangerous
since that point and yet we're budgeting
them so
what are there are two sort of big
reasons why this situation persists
one is
very simple
northrop grumman
uh makes a lot of profits right now from
building these new icbms as boeing did
in the past they lost out in the bidding
on this one so go through grumman and
lockheed
and jobs even unions political campaign
donations campaigns president
you'll make money from preparing
for her strike
uh and for a preemptive attack even
though that people understand that
actually to carry it out to use these
weapons would kill
nearly everyone that's one reason the
other reason is to come back to
building those weapons
makes it more plausible
that we will in the event of a small
nuclear war we will we will go first as
we promise to do and still promise to do
to nato and which backs up by the way
our
biden's growing support
or defending quote
taiwan 100 miles off mainland china
where they have conventional superiority
built up over the last 20 years
so that that threat when he talks about
when when pelosi goes to
taiwan
and
what amounts to an official visit
forbidden by the 1979 agreement with
china
is moving very much toward calling
taiwan
staffer
which has been described as a red line
for over half a century by china it's
saying secession
uh they're no more ready to see
succession of taiwan which they regard
as part of china
than lincoln was for good or bad
uh in the civil war
they're prepared they say that's a vital
issue for them and then we'll go to war
over just as putin talks about uh
the use of nuclear weapons in an
existential threat
to russia
only he regards ukraine as part of
russia and he's about it seems in
probably a month or so to our next part
of ukraine in the donbas
so what should we make of this fact that
any threat uh the only thing that would
call forth nuclear weapons
is a threat to russia yeah russia is a
same thing goes for taiwan we know that
china and chinese people
regard and demand of their leader
that taiwan be regarded as part of china
so if we
move as we are as biden is moving it
started under trump
to recognize instead a secessionist
taiwan as independent don't leave them
free as we put it
to have us spaces and to have offensive
weapons and to sell them offensive
weapons which you can be sure
that raytheon and northrop grumman and
boeing and general dynamics
are anxious
to sell taiwan in violation of the
constraints we accepted in 1979
so i come back to the point
our
we don't have a full alliance with
taiwan yet fortunately so that's the
direction we're moving in
we should be in a position to be able to
say to putin right now the world
everyone in the world should be able to
say to putin
you're talking about the risk of a
nuclear war over ukraine which we would
not
start in this case
it used to be that we were
conventionally inferior to the warsaw
pact including the soviet union and that
was the rationale for threatening to
blow up the world
if they went into west berlin
or germany but that has shifted the
warsaw pact except for russia
shifted sides and they're now all in
nato
so now
they have we have if you want to put a
conventional superiority there and it's
putin that is making the threats now
that's happening right now so putin is
using his nuclear weapons
the way we've used them for 70 years the
way you use a weapon where you pointed
at somebody's head pistol
in a confrontation you're using the
weapon you couldn't make the threat and
if you get your way without pulling the
trigger that's why you have the weapon
potent is saying now
nato don't come directly with your air
power or troops
into this conflict
or you're risking that i pull my trigger
okay so everybody should be willing to
say in the world you don't have any
right to do that that's outrageous
it's terrible it's risky it's reckless
in a way that the human language can't
even comprehend
but we can't say that and we're not
saying it
because that's our policy it always has
been
it needn't be in europe anymore
we could easily say
we will not use nuclear weapons first
in europe how about that or against
russia
or at all as guterres is rightly asking
us to do latin isn't going to say that
even though by the way he did say it in
his campaign he couldn't conceive of a
circumstance in which it would be
advantageous for the us to initiate
nuclear war mine that was his position
not as president any more than any of
his predecessors since 1945
because on the one hand it would change
our relation to europe we would no
longer be the protector of europe uh
have it as a protectorate that gives us
economic leverage and
as if we were european participate in
european arrangements
and second he can't do it because he
would be accused of inviting the chinese
into taiwan
by getting rid of a threat that is
implicit in american foreign policy all
the time he's not going to do that
so um
here we are in this situation that i
would say
first
led me into hysterical laughter at the
beginning of his uh discussion um and
really
known finally the cheerfulness here if
any uh was also the prospect of having a
discussion with you that doesn't happen
every day here
at all and uh i really enjoy it in fact
just the other day i'll show you
something i'm sending stuff to my
archive at umass amherst and uh sending
it up i came across
in my files this this paper which i read
terrific paper by noam chowsky u.s
involvement in vietnam uh written just
after
uh the war had ended finally in 1975.
remember you probably don't remember
this paper but i can recommend you by
the way there's one problem with it this
version of it doesn't have the footnotes
so i'm working on uh an academic friend
to get me the full thing with the
footnotes because they all look much but
of course it reminded me
[Music]
we had been in 75 you and i
uh on the same side
for eight years since about 67 when i
came back from vietnam
working together with the greatest
respect uh you'd been on the right side
much longer than that
all your life as far as i know
uh
before those eight years
i had been participating
as part of
the wrong side but anyway we've been in
for more than half a century working on
this
i've learned
i have not learned more from any person
on earth
from you know no one has contributed
more
you know just go back to 67 when i read
your your book on the american mandarins
and whatnot
the sentence in it which actually was
just indirect it said
the us acts as if it had a right
to do these things to be demolishing
vietnam
and you know threatening the world
and i as somebody who'd worked for the
government for more than a decade
thought to myself
a new idea
right
right i never heard it discussed never
heard the thought rate do you have a
right to do this or not a right to do
that and that was a very seminal thought
as far as i was concerned he'll help
change my life
so thank you
let me just add that
the fact that
dan was
right at the heart of it for many years
has been of extraordinary value
more than anyone else he's been able to
bring to us an understanding
of how things work on the inside
what the planning is like what the
thinking is like
how to understand what's happening now
because nothing much has changed
it's an invaluable contribution
quite apart from his
50 years of
direct
engagement courageous significant
engagement with all the material he's
brought forth now on the background of
nuclear planning first on the background
of the vietnam war
and it's been an incomparable
contribution
to
moving forward to try to achieve some
measure of
peace and justice in the world i'd also
like to mention another point that dan's
been making for about
i don't know how long i've heard it from
him for many years
he's pointed out
that nuclear weapons are used
it's not that they
might be used they are used
the analogy
he gave was something like
maybe the three of us
walking into a grocery store
say i have a gun
and i tell the
shopkeeper
open the cash register i'll blow you
away
he opens the cash register gives the
money away
i didn't shoot the gun and but i used it
and that's
the way things have been working for
decades
in fact that's official u.s policy
a very important document
confirming this barely discussed
1995 clinton years
what's called the essentials of
post-cold war deterrence stratcom
strategic command
asks
how do we deal this is not the post-cold
war how do we carry out what's called
deterrence
everybody's written war will
deterrence means aggression or
invasion or something like that
so how do we do it
well what they say straight out
is
nuclear weapons are always
prominent in the background
they offer
space
in which we can carry out
our
regular
uh
efforts in what's called defense like
overthrowing another government or a
subversion or whatever it may be
exactly dan's point
straight tongue
furthermore they say
that we must project a national persona
i'm virtually quoting now the national
persona of irrationality and
vindictiveness
we must present a picture to the world
of some elements being out of control
can't we'll never be able to stop them
they'll go crazy cursed lamenting
somebody else
and the world has to understand that
about us
it's what's called the madman theory
it's attributed to nixon
on the basis of pretty thin evidence
diary entries
but it's right in major documents
right in front of your eyes
straight comm document 1995
we must project
a national persona of
irrationality and vindictiveness
some elements out of control
we must waive the nuclear threat
constantly because it provides space
for
regular activities
dan's point
using nuclear weapons constantly
well
that's worth thinking about not keeping
in the shadows
and
sure that remains today dan can tell us
a lot more than i can
you remind me of that stratcom
no document
very good
the tools of a madman theory has been
associated with
nixon
when in fact he was ready to use nuclear
weapons in 1969 his first his first year
in indochina against by the way a
non-nuclear weapon state but one that
had allies of nuclear weapon states
china and russia
and uh he didn't carry that out
for one reason
in november or october of 1969 in
october there were two million people in
the streets
all over the country on one day it was
called the
moratorium they avoided the word that
they originally thought of general
strike because it sounded too radical
and too uh provocative so they called it
a moratorium you know a
a stopping of business as usual
and uh people took off from college and
from business and even the major major
businesses financial institutions
uh on the same day
in cities all over the country
300 here 10 000 there
and they and more than ten thousand in
some of the cities and they added them
all up on the same day and it came to
two million
and um nixon were by the way
counted in part by youtubes you know
high-flying planes that we used over
russia
to count the number of people in various
big demonstrations
and it wasn't a good time for nixon to
carry out his explicit threats and plans
plans to initiate nuclear war at that
time uh roger moore saw nuclear target
folders for hitting uh
north vietnam near the chinese border
it's in the chinese elections so we
found we got a moratorium
on pulling the trigger
for uh 15 years they're
worthwhile by people demonstrating in
that case but now many other cases have
arisen since then notice that that
struck come in 1995
was during the clinton administration
does that mean that clinton wasn't mad
enough to uh make these threats credible
well that happened to be a year in which
they weren't needed very much because
the soviet union just dissolved and were
so packed and dissolved and clinton was
starting the process disastrous process
of uh
getting
poland hungary and czechoslovakia
into nato uh you know
breaking as you i think you said
the clear-cut commitments that had been
made to gorbachev earlier that nato
would not expand and it's beyond
germany
and uh ukraine understood from that very
time on
by even people who had
started the cold war i mean been on the
creation as it's so-called
uh kennen was a disastrous
expansion and the the effects it was
likely to have
on the right wing in russia to change
politics in russia and to be regarded as
in
impinging on vital interests of russia
for that time
our policy ever since then from clinton
and reagan and all the others
i'm sorry clinton and george w bush and
later
and from
has been so
directed toward carrying out cannons
ominous warnings
which were echoed by the way by jack
matlock
the republican uh put in by the
republicans as ambassador to russia real
expert who had been saying don't do this
and many others many academics were once
on the right side were saying don't do
this and yet
we've moved into carrying out george w
bush's pronouncement in 2008
russia i'm sorry ukraine
and georgia will be part of nato this
was against the strong internal
objections
of germany and france and others
uh against this as a reckless act but
they didn't come out they went along
with this
under armed twisting by the u.s it was
2008. well
doing that ever since leads me
to a very
ominous
influence
that the us was certainly willing to
risk
what's happening now in ukraine with all
its attendant risks on escalation
to the world
i'm inclined to think or at least it's
uh equally possible
that they wanted it that our
establishment has wanted precisely this
not more
they don't want a nuclear war
but they're willing to risk it and
gamble with it and what is happening
right now
is perfect
better than
let's say
complaints by russia or whatever it has
restored the supposed necessity
of nato
with the us at its helm
with u.s nuclear threats on it
it has added to nato sweden and finland
who have properly kept out of it
since its inception now they're now
their ends expanded nato exactly what
putin presumably did not want
but it is it's a bonanza for the
military industrial complex
specifically for the firms and let me
name them again
uh northrop grumman
raytheon general dynamics boeing
lockheed
uh
their stock has all gone up and rightly
so
if you have no scruples
about where you invest your money
then those firms are a good bit
from now on
and they have gone up and they're going
to stay there up because their their
their
sales
prospects now have enormously increased
is that enough to be
an element in what's happened yes it is
the
t.p thompson said uh long ago before
they break up when they were still in
soviet union he said it's wrong to say
that the us and the soviet union
have military industrial complexes
it is more realistic to say
they are military industrial complexes
and you know in the strategic
role of these in research and
development
businesses and engineers and budgeting
and everything else so
these two aspects of restoring nato
leadership and a so-called atlanticist
and instead of a european
community from uh portugal to
vladivostok which gorbachev called for
in which others uh endorsed
that's not what the u.s ordered
they needed russia
as an enemy
otherwise
why do you need nato at all
if russia is as it was
trying to be
in the last years of gorbachev even
under yeltsin
uh corrupt and weak as he was trying to
be a friend
to the united states
every partner they even talked about
joining nato
that wouldn't make any sense
uh what would those weapons be for that
for selling them or that they're making
themselves
if russia is a friend that doesn't make
any sense why would us be needed
to protect europe
from a friendly russia no that was not
in other words moving as kennedy said to
make russia and see russia
and to make russia
an adversary
was essential the us
and that's what we've got
when do we want that to end
no you were i totally agree with the
punctuation earlier
this
killing
field in ukraine right now
must
come to a stop
and how is that possible only with
negotiations which are showing no
interest
and putin isn't showing much interest
but
we definitely we're making as you said
we're describing aims
that can never be achieved
weakening russia so it can't attack its
neighbors weakening russia so it can't
invade georgia
when will that happen uh never
so or mold diamond so
or others
the whole goal is you know to speak up
to think of uh
continuing killing in order to or you
know whatever sanctions to weaken
another country especially dangerously a
nuclear weapon state
so
or to let's say restore crimea now being
attacked but to restore crimea
to ukraine which kristoff uh gave it to
ukraine
some time ago kind of arbitrarily
when is that gonna happen
not very likely at all when are russian
troops going to leave entirely the known
bus where they've been for the last
eight years
this is a recipe we're announcing for an
indefinite war and why not it's good for
the military industry it's good for the
u.s foreign policy establishment
with uh our current
secretary of state lincoln uh and austin
and the others being in no way
better than the foreign policy team of
trump
or obama or anybody else
so
the same goes back to taiwan i keep
coming back
no you're the person who has connected
things consistently for the last half
century uh
and the
one thing that you're very unusual
unfortunately
is to see two
existential risks
not just climate which is an existential
risk but also nuclear which a lot of
environmentalists unfortunately
don't see
so you've been pressing on both these
points as i say you've really
illuminated my world
steadily
with your global perspective on these
things
anyway
if we don't change our
policy which is also
russian policy
uh on both climate and
nuclear weapons
then
you know
the world is headed
again what is the word catastrophe
doesn't encompass it
and uh
mass murder
multi-genocide omnicide near homicide
none of these we don't have words for it
so
thank you again for what you're doing
but the
at least the discussion
is possible uh the notion of no first
use has at least been discussed and even
that's not enough
in the non-proficient treaty and uh in
nato but uh and and it's it's one of
your recent articles pointed out
the idea of a europe
unified from
portugal to vladivostok
doesn't look in the cards now thanks to
the fact that we have
and i'm sorry to say i believe
successfully provoked
aggression crime
murder
from russia
uh but nevertheless we have acted to
increase the likelihood of that now for
at least a quarter of a century and
we've got it so voices like yours and
others to change that policy
and make it uh
not acceptable
that we won't negotiate or or the people
we support ukraine
that our support is unconditional
for an endless war
uh
that has to change or we won't
the forces
playing chicken
[Music]
have the world in their back seats
okay so noam for you want to do a final
kind of response to what daniel was
saying
i'll try to be brief
dan brought up something
of extreme importance the
framework and the overall framework of
global policy
within which all of this is taking place
through just keep
to europe uh over the uh
since the cold war began
uh there have been two
possible visions of the direction in
which europe might go
one is what's called the atlanticist
division
basically nato
u.s runs it
u.s sets the rules
we have what's called a
rule-based international order in which
the united states sets the rules and
europe obeys
europe doesn't like it they obey anyway
so for example europe is strongly
opposed to the u.s sanctions on iran
unto the
withdrawal from the iran treaty but they
obey
that's the atlanticist division
there's another vision
the gorbachev vision which goes back to
the goal
europe is an independent third force in
international affairs
uh independent of the united states has
a bigger economy in the united states
intellectual resources others call for
resources can be an independent force
in gorbachev's version
common your european home from us and
said from
portugal to that of us that
uh
that's the other vision
well the use u.s of course has
always been in favor of the atlanta's
this division in which it calls the
shots which means a military alliance
the gorbachev vision meant no military
alliances
co-equals
no victor no loser co-equals we work
together
on both sides we transform our societies
towards more effective social
democracies it's basically the gorbachev
vision
u.s vision is
atlanticist nato
military alliance
we expand to the russian borders in
violation of
people like
matlock kissinger almost anybody who
knew anything
about the russian affairs
well
putin's war aggression was certainly
provoked but it was certainly not
justified no aggression ever is so it's
a criminal act
like the u.s invasion of iraq like the
hitler stalin invasion of poland
criminalized
could have possibly been prevented
by paying attention to russia's
crucial demand
that you reiterated right before the
invasion
that nato that ukraine being neutralized
time like austria or like mexico for
that matter mexico can't join a hostile
chinese military alliance country being
blown away you know so yeah neutral
status
could have been avoided
well
putin by invading there were
opportunities that might have been
pursued
by
emmanuel macron
french prime minister
troops and germany they just dismissed
them flat out no response
if it pursued them
maybe something would have worked the
u.s of course opposed them
but might have moved forward
might have actually moved towards an
accommodation
which could lead to something like the
common european home
well instead he handed the united states
on a silver platter
exactly what it wants subservient europe
just following u.s orders and demands
i don't know if that's going to last
europe
is the this is going to suffer severely
from this conflict
not the united states
as dan pointed out the
military system is just
exalting as are the fossil fuel
industries couldn't be happier
but a germ the german-based european
system
is suffering they can't survive this way
in fact they can't even move to
renewable energy without russian
resources there's a natural
interaction between
russia and europe which is
basically unbreakable
they furthermore can't have access
to the vast china-based uh eurasian
program by now reaching already into
europe
uh in china's establishing the biggest
uh
battery
company in the world in europe and
hungary they're moving the
germany and the rest are going to have
to deal with this somehow i don't think
this atlanta system
is going to be able to survive
that we'll see but that's been the
conflict well what about china
there's supposed to be a china threat
there is
china doesn't follow orders
it's not like europe
you tell europe
we want you to observe
sanctions that you hate they say okay we
hate them but we'll observe them
china doesn't listen
they go their own way
that's intolerable
that's what in internal documents are
called
successful defiance
of u.s policies
can't allow that
that's why we
that's kind of interesting as dan
pointed out
correctly these
escalating tensions with taiwan
is sheer insanity
there is a policy the one china policy
has been in place for 50 years has
strategic ambiguity it's been working
why upset it
why have
huge
naval operations rim back
in the pacific with dozens of countries
participating aiming in china
why have as biden established
going beyond trump
a row of what he calls sentinel states
heavily armed with
u.s precision weapons
south korea and japan and
taiwan and australia
they try to get indeed in
india isn't really participating uh
all aimed at china to counter the china
threat
it's not that china's a nice place there
are a lot of rotten things
but the threat is
there are obey orders
we're not going to accept that
that's
old policy
this very successful defiance
incidentally is
from
1960s
policy about cuba
state department declared that the
threat of cuba
is its successful defiance of u.s policy
going back to the monroe doctrine which
declared our right to control the
hemisphere
no threats
just can't accept that
can't accept it from a small island like
cuba which we can torture and attack for
60 years
certainly can accept it from china so
we'll face the
we'll have a
strategic posture
established by trump continued by biden
of being ready to fight
two wars simultaneously
with
china and russia
i mean as dan pointed out there's no
there's no words in the language for
this
lunacy doesn't work and catastrophe
doesn't work they have to invent
something new
that's where we are
you know if i may say just on that last
point i know which say very well
the what i was trying to say earlier
was
our policy has been nothing other than a
madman policy from its beginning and it
remains that
and to define it when you say
is it lunatic
it's a threat
of an unequivocally insane action an
evil action it's a threat it's a
preparation it's a risk
unfortunately
it's not either leaders
but a large part of the follower a large
part of the public
readily humans
accept the idea
that uh to threaten
a massively unprecedentedly evil action
is not necessarily evil in itself we can
use it instrumentally to risk it
uh is not necessarily mad and it has its
successes
actually west berlin
200 kilometers inside east germany
surrounded by soviet divisions which we
couldn't penetrate at that time
was kept out of the warsaw pact out of
the soviet union
by our threat to blow the world up
it worked i don't think any other way
could have kept burling and very
successful
uh as you say it was at like a
7-11 on the very you know other extreme
of the spectrum
where the cashier handed over the money
they got we got what we wanted from that
but at the risk
of maintaining
uh this apparatus to blow up the world
so
trying to change public attitudes to
recognize that there is insanity even to
the risk and to the threat and the
preparation not just to carrying it out
uh you know just this last week
what seems to be the major
now the major um
rival
to succeed boris johnson in england
has changed a little it's now i think
liz truss
and she was asked on a program just i i
just saw it yesterday on youtube
uh
are you ready
to press the button
on trident submarines and to initiate
nuclear war
and uh and and the interviewer
spelled it out he said which would lead
to you know the destruction of humanity
and civilization and so forth are you
ready to do it theresa may when she was
a woman uh premiere i had to had to
answer the same question
when she on her first
meeting in parliament her first answer
question they both gave the same answer
of course uh let me amazing yes um
[Music]
liz trust said the other day yes it's a
principal duty of the prime minister
uh
she just she could have said more
precisely
to to
under some circumstances you know
she just said it's a principal duty
uh to be ready to press that button yes
i am ready to do it you know the guy
pressed her in it uh he said you know if
i were in that position i would feel
sick at that i would be sick to my
stomach the thought of doing that
and uh
she said i'm ready to do it.
now
a what else could she say that she's
she's vying to be the prime minister of
the british nuclear force
and so forth could she would she be a
candidate if she said no i couldn't do
that under any circumstances so
politically but people uh she more or
less had to do it but politically
um
people did point out
that she did this very unemotionally
uh
you know matter of fact yes yes i would
fire trident which as i said would lead
to a nuclear winter essential trigger to
it
and so she's saying
you know i would do this
insane lunatic
action which the words
well that should make her a candidate
not for tin downing street
but for a padded cell
in which
she would have a lot of company it would
not be isolation
there would be a large wing
of the uh
institution for the criminally insane
that would be populated by most of our
leadership
and her officials but that's not the way
it is
and the public so far accepts that there
would be people who vote for for that in
all in all the nuclear weapons states
and
remember we've got a country here
there's nobody voted out with a
republican party
that not only for years as you've been
saying
is the most dangerous party in its
absolute determination to stop any
stealing any restraint on the emission
of co2
but now
denies
that biden is president
showing that just no limits to human
denial and that's something i've learned
in my old age it's taken a long time but
there it is uh
there are no limits left or right really
any human is capable of doing this uh i
haven't actually seen you know
but i have to say my generalization is
very strict i think any human
without exception i haven't seen would
be you may not have a demonstration of
it
is capable of participating in group
activities that do harm and denying them
and turning their eyes from them
and that's a human characteristic
we have to find a way to transcend
thank you so much gnome thank you so
much dan
i don't think i can end with any form of
laughter hysterical or otherwise but
i'll try
we're going to pick this up in another
segment we're going to do next week so
look forward everyone can look forward
to that thanks again
