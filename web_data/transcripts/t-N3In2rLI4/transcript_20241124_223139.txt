Welcome to another 'World After Corona
Virus'. I am really happy and honoured for
this special episode, because there is a
special guest, joining us today.
And that special guest is, not only mine
but a hero of many generations.
Both of us are unfortunately in self-
isolation, so this is also very a special
occasion, but without further introduction
I think most of you, who are watching this
know who is Noam Chomsky and I am
so glad that Noam is joining us today.
Hello Noam, could you just tell us,
where are you, are you already in self-
isolation and for how long?
Well, I am in Tucson, Arizona in
self-isolation.
So, you wrote, you were born in 1928
And you wrote your first essay, as far as
I know, when you were only ten years old,
which was an essay on the Spanish
civil war. Actually just after the fall
of Barcelona and so that was 1938,
which looks very far away, for
my generation. You survived the second
world war, Hiroshima, you were a witness
to Hiroshima, you were a witness to many
very big important political, historic
events, from the Vietnam War, to the oil
crisis, to the fall of the Berlin wall.
Before that, you where a witness
to Chernobyl, after that in the 90s,
you where a witness to a historical moment
which was leading to 9/11, which was also
a global event and most recently, I mean
I am trying to really shorten a long
history of a lifetime of someone like you,
but the most recent event was the
financial crash of 2007 and 2008.
So in this background, of such a rich life
and being a witness and also an actor in
this major historical processes, 'how do
you look at the current corona virus
crisis? Is it an unprecedented historical
event, is it something which surprised
you? How do you look at it? That would
be my question.
I should say that my earliest memories
which are haunting me now, are from the
1930s, the article that you mentioned
on the fall of Barcelona was acting mainly
about the, apparently, inexorable spread
of the fascist plague all over the,
all over Europe and how it was gonna end.
I later, did much later discovered, when
internal documents came out, that the
analyst of the U.S government, at the time
and the following years expected, that the
war would end with, the end of the war
was coming, that the war would end with,
the world divided into U.S dominated air
regions and a German dominated region.
So my childhood fears were not entirely
out of place. And these memories come back
now. I can recall, when I was a child, a
young child listening to Hitler's Nuremberg
rallies over the radio, I couldn't
understand the words but you could easily
understand the mood and the threat and
so on, and I have to say when I listen to
Donald Trump's rallies today, it resonates.
It's not that he's a fascist, he doesn't
have that much of an ideology,
he's just a sociopath, but an individual
concerned with himself, but the mood and
the fears is similar and the idea that the
fate of the country and the world is in
the hands of a sociopathic buffoon, is
shocking. The coronavirus is serious enough
but it's worth recalling that there is a
much greater horror approaching, we are
racing to the edge of disaster, far worse
then anything that's happened in human
history. And Donald Trump and his minions
are in the lead, in racing to the abyss.
In fact there are two immense threats that
we are facing. One is the growing threat
of nuclear war, which has exacerbated it by
the tearing what's left of the arms
control regime and the other of course is
the growing threat of global warming.
Both threats can be dealt, but there isn't
a lot of time and the corona virus is a
horrible can have terrifying consequences
But there will be recovery, while the
others won't be recovered, it's finished.
If we don't deal with them, we're done.
And so the childhood memories are coming
back to haunt me, but a different
dimension. The threat of nuclear war
didn't get a sense of where the world
really is, by looking to early,
to this January, as may you know
every year the doomsday clock is set, set
with the minute-hand at certain distance
from midnight, which means termination.
But, ever since Trump was elected, the
minute hand has been moving closer and
closer to midnight. Last year it was two
minutes to midnight. The highest, matching
the highest it ever reached. This year the
analysts dispensed with minutes, started
moving to seconds, 100 seconds to midnight
That's the closest it's ever been.
Sighting three things: The threat of
nuclear war, threat of global warming and
the deterioration of democracy, which
doesn't quite belong into here
but it does, because that's the only,
hope that we have,
for overcoming the crisis
and in for [inaudible] public taking
control of their fate, if that
doesn't happen, we are doomed.
If we are leaving our fate to
sociopathic buffoons, we're finished.
And that's coming close, Trump
is the worst, that's because of
US Power, which is overwhelming.
We are talking about U.S decline,
but you just look at the world,
you don't see that when the U.S
imposes sanctions, murderers,
devastating sanctions, that's the
only country that can do that,
but everyone has to follow.
Europe may not like, in fact
hate actions on Iran, but
they have to follow, they
have to follow the master, or else they
get kicked out of the international
financial system. Thats not a law of
nature it's a decision in Europe to be
subordinate to the master in
Washington, other countries
don't even have a choice.
And back to the Coronavirus,
one of the most shocking,
harsh aspects of it, is the use of
sanctions, to maximize the pain,
perfectly consciously, Iran is
in a zone, enormous internal problems.
By the stranglehold of tightening
sanctions, which are consciously designed,
openly, to make the suffer and suffer
bitterly now. Cuba has been suffering
from it, from the moment, where it gained
independence, but it's astonishing,
that they survived but they stayed
resilient and one of the most ironic
elements of today's virus crisis, is that Cuba
is helping Europe. I mean this is so
shocking, that you don't know how
to describe it. That Germany can't help
Greece, but Cuba can help the European
countries. If you stop to think about
what that means, all the words fail,
just as when you see thousands of people
dying in the Mediterranean, fleeing
from a region, that has been devastated
for centuries and being sent to the deaths
in the Mediterranean, you don't know
what words to use.
The crisis, the civilizational crisis of
the West at this point is devastating,
to think of them and it does bring
up childhood memories of listening to
Hitler raving on the radio to raucous crowds
it makes you wonder if this species
is even viable.
You mentioned the crisis of democracy,
At this moment I think we find ourselves
also in a historically unpresedented
situation, in the sense that almost
2 billion people, that's a figure I found
today, are in one or the other way
confined at home, whether it is isolation,
self-isolation or quarantine.
Almost 2 billion people in the world are
at home, if they are lucky enough to have
a home. At the same time what we can
witness is that Europe, but also other
countries, closed their borders,
not only internal ones but outer borders.
There is an estate of exception in all the
countries we can think of, which means
curfew in many countries,
such as France, Serbia, Spain, Italy and
other countries, army on the streets
and what I want to ask you as a linguist,
Is the length language which is now,
circulating around. If you listen not just
to Donald Trump, if you listen to
Macron, also some other European
politicians, you will constantly hear that
they speak about, war.
And even the media speak about
doctors who are on the first "front
line" and the virus is called an enemy.
Which reminded me of course also,
not of childhood memories, luckily but
a book which was written at that time,
Victor Klemperer, "Lingua tertii imperii"
the book which, which is a book about
the language of the Third Reich and
in which way through the language,
the ideology was imposed, so from
your perspective, what does this discourse
about war, tell us and why do they present
a virus as an enemy, is it just to
legitimize the new state of exception or
is there something deeper in this
discourse?
protect the rhetoric, but I think it's
not exaggerated. It has some significance.
The meaning is, that if we want to deal
with the crisis, we have to move
to something like wartime mobilization.
So if you think of, take a rich country,
like United States, it has the resources
to overcome the immediate economic
The mobilization for the Second
World War, led the country into far
greater debt than is contemplated today
and was very a successful mobilization,
practically quadrupled the U.S
manufacturing, ended the depression, left
the country with [inaudible] instead, but a
capacity to grow. That's less than we need
probably, not on that scale it's not like
this in a world war, but we need the
mentality of the movement, of a social ???
is to try to overcome the short-run
crisis, which is severe. Also here we,
can recall the swine flue epedemic
in 2009, to originated in the U.S.
Couple hundreds thousand people,
at the first sight recovered from
worst, but it has to be dealt with,
That's a rich country like the States.
Now there's two biillion people,
the majority are in India. What happens
for Indian, they live from hand to mouth,
who's isolated, starves to death.
What's gonna happen?
In a civilized world, the rich countries
would be giving assistance, after those
who were in need, instead of strangling
them, which is what we are doing,
particularly in India but in much of the
world. The kind of crisis, you know
whether the crisis can be within a
country like India, I don't know, bear in
mind that the, with current tendencies
if they persist South Asia, is going to
be unlivable in a few decades.
The temperature reached a 50 degrees,
in Rajasthan this summer and it's
increasing. The waters right now,
could get even worse, there's two nuclear
powers, they're gonna be fighting over
restricting reduced water supplies.
I mean the corona virus is very serious,
we can't underestimate it, but we have to
remember that it's a fraction, small
fraction of major crisis, that are coming
along. They may not disrupt life to the
extent, that the corona virus does today,
but they will disrupt life to the point of
making the species unsurvivable and not
in the very distant future.
So we have many problems to deal with,
well, immediate ones, corona virus is
serious, has to be dealt with and
much larger ones, vastly larger ones,
they're looming. Now, there is the
civilizational crisis, we have to time
possibly good side of the corona virus,
as it may, might bring people to think
about what kind of a world do we want?
Do we want the kind of world that leads
to this? We should think about
the origins of this crisis, why is there a
corona virus crisis? Its a colossal market
failure, it goes right back to the essence
of markets, exacerbated by the neoliberal,
savage, neoliberal intensification of
deep social economic problems.
It was known for a long time,
that pandemics are very likely and it was
understood, very well understood, that
there likely to be corona virus pandemic
slight modifications of the SARS
epidemic, 15 years ago it was overcome,
the viruses were identified, sequenced,
vaccines were available, labs around the
world, could be working right then on
developing protection for potential
corona virus pandemics.
Why didn't they do it?
The market signals were wrong.
The drug companies, we have handed over
our fate to private tyrannies, hold
corporations, which are unaccountable
to the public, in this case, big Pharma
and for them they make new body creams,
it's more profitable, than that of finding
a vaccine that will protect people from
total destruction. It's impossible for the
government to step in, going back to
wartime mobilization, that's what happened
Polio, at the time, I can remember very
well was a terrifying threat, it was ended
by the discovery of the Salk vaccine, by
a government institution, set off by the
Roosevelt administration. No Patents,
available to everyone. That could have
been done this time, but the neoliberal
plague has blocked that.
We are living under an ideology, for which
economists have a good bit of
responsibility, so which comes from the
corporate sector. An ideology, which is
typified by that Ronald Reagan reading
the script haded to, by his corporate
masters with his sunny smile, saying
government is the problem. Let's get rid
of government, which means, let's hand
over decisions to private tyrannies,
that are unaccountable with the public.
On the other side of the Atlantic,
Thatcher was instructing us, that there is
a society, just individuals thrown into
the market to survive somehow and
furthermore, there is no alternative.
The world has been suffering under
the rich, years and it's now at the point
where things, that could be done,
like direct government intervention
on the scope the invention of the Salk
vaccine, but that's blocked for
ideological reasons, coming out of the
neoliberal plague and the point is that
this corona virus epidemic could have
been prevented, the information was there
to be read, in fact it was well known in
October 2019, just before the outbreak.
There was a large scale simulation,
by level simulation in the United States,
in the world of the possible pandemic of
this kind. Nothing was done, now the
crisis was then made worse by the
treachery of the political systems.
We did't pay attention to the information
that they were aware of, on December 31st,
China informed the World Health
Organisation of pneumonia, like symptoms
with unknown etiology. A week later,
they identified, some Chinese scientists,
identified it as a corona virus,
furthermore they sequenced it and gave
the information to the world, by then
virologists, others who were bothering
to read World Health Organization report
knew, that they were Corona Virus and
they knew how to deal with it.
Did they do anything, well yes, some did.
The countries in the area, China,
Soth Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, began to
do something and they have sort of
pretty much it seems contained, at least
the first surge of crisis.
In Europe to some extent, that's happened.
Germany which had, which hadn't
moved, just on time, it has the hospital
systems under the liberalism,
did have spare diagnostic capacity and
was able to act in a highly selfish
fashion, not helping others but for itself
at least, to have a reasonable containment
Other countries just ignored it, the worst
of them the United Kingdom and
the worst of all was the United States,
which happens to be led by [inaudible]
who says, you know one day there's no
crisis, it's just like flu, the next day
it's a terrible crisis, I knew it
all along, the next day we have to give it
for business, because I have to win the
election. The Idea that the world is in
these hands, is shocking, but the point is
that it started with it, again, a colossal
market failure by pointing to fundamental
problems the social economic order,
made much worse by the neoliberal
plague and it continues, because of the
collapse of the kinds of institutional
structures, that could deal with it, if
they were functioning.
These are topics that we ought to be
thinking about seriously and thinking
in more depth about, as I said,
what kind of world do we want to live in?
If we overcome somehow, there
will be options. The options range from
the installation of highly authoritarian
brutal States all the way over to radical
reconstruction to society and more
humane terms, concerned with human needs
of private profit. That we should bear in
mind, that highly authoritarian vicious
states are quite compatible with neo-
liberalism, in fact, the [inaudible] of
neo-liberalism from [inaudible] to Hayek
the rest, were perfectly happy with
massive state violence, as long as it
supported what they called sound
economics. Neo-liberalism has it's origins
in 1920s Vienna, from [inaudible]
could barely contain in his delight, in
the proto-fascist of the Austrian state
and smashed the labor unions and
Austrian social democracy and joined the
early proto-fascist government, praised
it. praised fascism, in fact, because of
his protecting sound economics.
When Pinochet installed a murderer's
brutal dictatorship in Chile, they all
loved it, they all fought there, [inaudible]
helped out of this marvelous
miracle, that was bringing sound
economics, great profit to it, for haness
up some small part of the population.
So, it's not out of line to think, of
a savage neoliberal system might be
reinstalled by self-proclaimed
libertarians with a powerful state
violence, imposing, that's one part,
one nightmare, that might come about.
But it's not necessary, there is the
possibility that people will organize,
become engaged, as many are doing,
and bringt about a much better world,
which will also confront the enormous
problems, that were facing right down
the road, the problems of nuclear war,
which is closer than it's ever been and
the problems of environmental
catastrophe from which there is no
recovery once we've gotten to that stage,
that it's not far in distance, unless we
act decisively.
So it's a critical moment of human
history, not just because of the corona
virus, but to bring us, should bring us to
awareness of the profound flaws the
world flawed not strong enough, the deep,
dysfunctional characteristics of
the whole socio-economic system,
which has to [inaudible], if
there's going to be a survivable future.
So this could be a warning sign and
a lesson to deal with it today or prevent
it from exploding, but thinking of it's
roots and how those roots are going to
lead to more crisis, worse ones than this,
extra pay right away.
And since we don't have much time,
I'll just pose one last question, yes, so,
I think many people are interested and
also us, who are active in social
movements and mobilization and
organized for decades, using physical and
social closeness between people, but
now suddenly we are all getting
accustomed to what is now being called
'Social-distancing', so my questions is,
how do you see the future of social
resistance, in times of social distance
and if this takes a few more months,
not to mention maybe a year to two,
and we are mainly in self isolation at
home, what would be your advise to
progressives around the world, activists,
also intellectuals, students, workers,
how to organize in this new situation?
And could you perhaps tell us wether you
see a hope , that instead of going into
a global authoritarianism, this open
historic situation might go in a radical
transformation of the world, which would
be green, equal, just and full
of solidarity?
First of all, we should bear in mind that,
in the past few years, there has been a
form of social isolation, which is very
damaging. Now you go into a
McDonalds and take a look at a bunch of
teenagers, sitting around the table,
having a hamburger, what you see is,
two conversations going. One sort of
shallow discussion among them,
another the one, that each one is having
on his cellphone, with some remote
individual, who with friend.
This has atomized and isolated people to
an extraordinary extent.
The Thatcher principle, there was no
society, has escalated, the misused
social media, that has turned people into
very isolated creatures, especially young
people. There are actually universities,
now in the United States, where the
sidewalk have plaques on them, saying,
look up. Because every kid is walking
around, is glued to itself. That's a form
of self induced social isolation, which
has been very harmful. We're now on a
situation of real social isolation. It has
to be overcome by recreating, social bonds
in whatever way can be done , who
need if whatever kind that can be helping
people in need. Contacting them,
developing organizations, expanding
analyzation, like before I'm getting them
to be functional and operative,
making plans for the future,
bringing people together as he can in the
internet age, to join, consult deliberate
to figure out answers to the problems
that they face and work on them,
which can be done, it's not face to-face
communication which for human beings is
essential. But it'll be deprived of it for
a while, you can put it on hold find other
ways and continue with the, and
in fact, extend and deepen the activities
carried out, can be done, it's not going
to be easy, but humans have faced problem
Can I pose a question, since we are both
in self-isolation?
My dog is trying to have a conversation?
Was that before a parrot? You have a
bird as well or a parrot? Or a bird,
there was a sound of a bird, yes?
Yes, a ????? Parrot, it can say:
Sovereignty to all the people in
Portuguese.
