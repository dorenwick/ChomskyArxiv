assalamu alaikum and welcome everyone to
another episode of danish tv's english
language channel
and today we are incredibly fortunate to
once again after roughly a year and two
months to have professor noam chomsky
world-renowned linguist and social
critic moral philosopher and one of the
world's leading public intellectuals for
at least half a century now it is an
extraordinary honor and privilege to
have you back on our show today
welcome professor chonsky thank you very
much
quickly my first question professor
chomsky
liberals and progressives in pakistan
tend to see the taliban as a pakistani
proxy force
with no social base or roots or
legitimacy in the country akin to the
american contra proxies in nicaragua do
you share such an assessment or do you
think a little more nuance is required
well like it or not
the taliban have a
fairly solid base in the community
they could not have taken over without
that
in fact they've extended their base
one of the few surprises
in my view in the
last several months
was how the taliban
quickly expanded their support
from their
traditional
pashtun base
to a much more
multi-ethnic
at least tolerance if not acceptance
the collapse of the
former of the warlords who
from other who based in other ethnic
groups
uh
except for the hazara
they mostly uh
that was
pretty much surprise i don't think
anyone
please die didn't anticipate that
whether this is support or tolerance
is another question
but
that they have
a base in the
rural community is
hard to deny
i mean after all when the
taliban decided
to disappear
after the u.s invasion
they mostly went back to their villages
well what does that mean
then
as the
uh and in fact it seems that at first
there was
some hope
that the american invasion might lead to
some sort of
development improvement in the
economic and social system
as soon as it turned out that the
american troops were just
fortifying the old warlords
uh
and relying on them
to carry out their own
uh
violent uh efforts at domination and
control
and we're smashing into houses and
midnight to arrest somebody and threw
them into a torture chamber
bombing uh
wedding parties and so on of course
taliban started emerging again all of it
is a taliban generating system
went on for has been well described by
anand gopal other few other journalists
who are very close on the scene all the
time
american intelligence surely knew it
uh
well then the taliban emerged gradually
expanded their base
uh when
trump told them take over anything you
like all they had to do was
wait their time
get ready when the time came
yes they took over
as i say the surprising part
to me at least was the expansion of
their base
to the other
tajik
uzbek
uh
areas
the areas around the hebrat also a bit
of a surprise
but
and again
to what extent this is support
to what extent it's
simply tolerance of what exists
is very hard to determine
but i don't see how one can
question that they are
in effect the governing authority at
this point
right
thank you professor chomsky just one
other question on afghanistan
particularly in light of the very
chaotic way in which the american
withdrawal
finally took place professor chomsky
with regards to that intervention many
progressives in the region still believe
that for all of its faults the
intervention could have possibly
improved the situation in terms of human
rights and women's rights in the country
and reduced the repression that was
experienced before uh under the taliban
so even though many ngos as you very
well know were against the initial
bombing many like amnesty international
as late as 2012
did want american forces to stay
genuinely believing that the occupation
will be beneficial for afghans what are
your thoughts on this professor chomsky
the american
when you say it might have been
beneficial sure
the russian intervention
in the 80s might have been beneficial
in fact in some ways it was
the horrible intervention killed maybe a
million people
but in the last couple of years
uh the situation the situation in
russian
controlled areas like in kabul
was quite significantly improving
the
there were
serious human rights activists there
uh maybe the most important was uh
russell bosu the
u.n
coordinator for women's rights
built well-known international feminist
figure
who was
writing describing at the end how
women's rights had greatly improved in
kabul uh not in the countryside where
the fighting was
and that women were
pretty free to do what they wanted
dresses they wanted go to the
universities have jobs
the main danger they were facing was
from the
u.s bacter
and pakistan-backed
mujahideen
people like the hekmatyar group who
would throw acid in the faces of women
who were dressed wrong and so on and so
forth
there was a
relatively
popular government the najibullah
government
actually held out for a couple of years
after the russians withdrew
these
reports are
pretty well supported by
other
specialists in the area
uh
roderick braithwaite the
british ambassador to russia who's a
specialist on afghanistan
he actually returned in
2006 and wrote in the
financial times the major business
journal
article in which he said that in
kabul
i said
checking
in many different sources including
the former mujahideen that found that
there was a lot of feeling that
najibullah was probably the best
prospect for
afghanistan
and that things
were better
in the last years of the russian
occupation
than they were at that time
under the american occupation in 2006.
but he says we can't be sure how much of
this is
uh opposition to
what's happening now under the american
occupation and how much is
realistic interpretation of what things
were like
but yes when you go back to your
question
under you could have said the russians
could have
improved things and in fact in some
respects did
in kabul at least in the last couple of
years
and it's true that the americans could
have acted very differently
but they didn't
and there was no reason to believe that
if they stayed on anything was going to
change
so one way or another
the
harsh and brutal american intervention
had to be
withdrawn i think it could have been
done quite differently
if trump hadn't sold everything out
and biden partially accepted his
policy
it would have been possible to
withdraw
in a more organized fashion to allow
local accommodations to take place
to give
higher
priority to the
afghan peace forces which did exist may
still exist
and we're organizing around the country
with
local arrangements accommodations and
quite decent policies could have been
possible to do that
whether it would have succeeded
nobody's any way of knowing
right or pakistan has a lot of
responsibility for this we don't have to
go into it you know it very well
but if pakistan had acted differently
if the united states had acted
differently
things might have been better
now we're
facing this situation
and
the life question now
is how to deal
with the catastrophe that has taken
place
here there are
basically two positions emerging
one of them is
essentially the
regional
uh powers
china being the dominant one
growing out of the
shanghai cooperation organization
which have taken the position that
they have to recognize the taliban as
the
governing authorities
work with them
try to get them to be more inclusive and
moderate but crucially
addressing the very serious humanitarian
crisis in the country
that means
bringing in
a aid development
trying to
shift the economy from the
heroin opium based economy to
more
constructive use of
afghans
quite considerable mineral resources and
to try to move in this direction over
time
that's one
approach
within the
within this group
basically the shanghai cooperation
organization
the only opponents
so far have been india
india wants to keep to the
u.s program
of uh
isolating the taliban breaking relations
with them refusing to deal with them
cutting off aid
even
even
keeping
the
afghan government resources that are
that had been kept in
uh
new york banks keep them there don't let
the government have them
pressure the international
financial institutions not to support
and give them aid
those are basically the two positions
that are
developing now
from the way i described them you can
see which one i think you can guess
which one i think is
preferential maybe
you would like to frame them differently
that's the way it looks to me
and i think that's the life question now
how to proceed
with these issues
professor chomsky you remain an
inspiration to generations old and new
to continue the work for justice and
peace
again an incredible privilege to spend
time with you and thank you so much for
joining us here on danish tv professor
chomsky thank you very much
take care goodbye
