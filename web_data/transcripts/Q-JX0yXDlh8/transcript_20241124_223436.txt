well let's take a look at the war of Dr
on drugs right I mean it's been declared
probably 20 times in the last 20 years
or so every couple years it's
declared uh it's declared against a
background of
understanding uh for example it was
studied Years Ago by the ran Corporation
the main government advisory Corporation
and the Army in which they investigated
uh just straight cost benefit an
analysis of various ways of treating the
drug problem drug problems here it's not
in Colombia uh so uh they said well you
know which ways of dealing with the
problem here are coste effective and
they found which will surprise no one
who's paid attention to the history that
the most coste effective way of doing it
uh is prevention and
treatment okay in fact if you think
about it that's the way one of the worst
drug problems has been handled I mean
there is a drug which is much worse than
cocaine it's called tobacco it kills far
more people uh than uh cocaine does and
it was handled pretty well by a cultural
change so if you look through the
1980s it's a class issue so people with
education and you know degree of
privilege simply adopted a more healthy
lifestyle they stopped smoking they
stopped eating red meat they didn't
drink as much coffee and so on there
were no police you know no nobody uh
carried out chemical warfare in North
Carolina and Kentucky to destroy tobacco
Fields this it was simply an educational
process a kind of cultural change that
led to a significant decline of the use
of by far the most dangerous drug uh
among people who were uh a part of that
uh cultural change that took place
thanks to their privilege okay now
that's exactly what the Rand and the
Army study years ago uh they were of
course discussing tobacco but that's
exactly what they concluded about the
hard drugs or marijuana they said the
best the cheapest and the most effective
way of dealing with it is prevention and
treatment well there's another way uh
use of police okay that's much less
effective and much more costly uh
there's a Third Way interdiction at the
border
that's still more expensive by quite a
large margin and far less and far more
costly and the worst way of all you know
way more costly than anything else and
totally ineffective is uh what we call
fumigation but what in fact is chemical
warfare I've been down to Southern
Colombia and seen some of it it's
chemical warfare which is driving uh
huge numbers of peasants off their land
destroying their crops Colombia has the
second biggest Refugee problem in the
world after Sudan uh and they're driven
into urban slums and multinational
corporations come in and start Mining
and so on and so forth that's the least
effective and the uh uh most costly and
you know the fact that we do it again if
you can kind of abstract yourself and
pretend you're a martian looking at this
it's just kind of unimaginable I mean
the number of people in Colombia killed
by us tobacco is Way Beyond the number
of Americans killed by Colombian cocaine
if you go to a country like China it's
astronomically more okay do they have a
right to come to the United States and
uh carry out chemical warfare in North
Carolina and Kentucky because uh uh they
have a tobacco problem and it's coming
from here yeah I mean you can't even
speak the words it's so outlandish but
we do it and we think it's just fine you
know even though it's known to be the
least effective uh the most costly and
totally immoral as we see right away if
we think of the situation reversed well
that's been going on for decades that's
the War on Drugs uh the use hasn't
affected the use of drugs here at all uh
in fact you know just take a look at the
cost of drugs and availability barely
changed well you know when people carry
out a so-called War for years and years
when they know what the consequences are
going to be and they have plenty of
evidence that that's exactly what the
consequences are it has no effect on
drugs a rational person will begin to
ask themselves is this a War on Drugs
okay I mean are they totally
insane uh is it a war on drugs or is it
a war to
uh in Colombia for example part of a war
of
counterinsurgency uh to clear peasants
off the land so that the multinational
corpor mining corporations and aggri
business can come in and so on and in
the United States is it a war on drugs
or is it an effort to get rid of uh what
are called the dangerous classes uh
people if you look at the history of
prohibition there's good work in legal
history on the history of prohibition
it's very typically aimed at what are
called the dangerous classes people who
are kind of getting in our hair so what
we call prohibition you know
uh Banning of alcohol wasn't aimed at uh
wealthy people in Westchester County New
York so on they could do whatever they
liked but it was aimed at workingclass
people and immigrants and you know the
bars and downtown
Manhattan uh marijuana if you look at
the prohibition of marijuana it was not
on medical grounds it was because it was
used by
Mexicans uh and then it was used in the
1920s by blacks and the Harlem
Renaissance and then of course in the
1930s the Bureau of Narcotics had a big
problem prohibition came came in and
they had this huge apparatus and what
are they going to do with it I they had
to find something so okay figure we'll
go after marijuana but the drug of the
dangerous classes if kind of if you look
at the whole in fact this goes back to
the 19th century I mean in 19th century
England uh Jin was uh prohibited but
whiskey wasn't well just take a look at
who was drinking them uh and that runs
right through history these are Wars to
control the dangerous classes uh in fact
the explosion of the War on Drugs here
was in the 1980s and since and during
that period uh us incarceration programs
just flew off the Spectrum I mean back
around
1980 the US was sort of slightly at the
high end of industrial societies and per
capita incarceration but within the
Spectrum and now it's five to 10 times
as high as comparable countries not
because there's more crime in fact
crimes remain kind of steady it's still
relative to other countries where it was
and if you take a look at who's in jail
yeah the PE the useless people black
males people who we can't incorporate in
our society this is the residue of
slavery of course in of different genes
uh so yeah they're the ones we get rid
of me in Latin America there's a name
for it it's called social cleansing uh
the dangerous classes you send out the
death squads and you know kill them and
leave them under the bridge we're more
Humane here so you put them in jail jail
forever uh and uh the the
imprisonment the it's not just the level
of incarceration but the savagery of it
is just unknown in comparable countries
like Amnesty International did a study a
couple of years ago of children in
prison without chance of parole so
permanently permanent uh imprisonment I
don't remember the exact numbers but
they didn't deal with countries that
don't have statistics you know like
Sudan but in the countries where you
know something about what's going on I
think they found something like maybe
2500 cases and about 2400 were in the
United States I mean this includes cases
of you know 12-year-old kid who happened
to be in a room where a a felony murder
was carried out okay he's in jail for
life actually I've seen cases like this
in prison which are well I say one case
just I don't know how prevalent it is
but during the Civil Rights years I was
down in Jackson Mississippi for
demonstration and uh I was with Howard's
in couple other people from up here and
we designated
ourselves proper self- congratulation as
a New England professor's delegation so
we were escorted through the prison by
the police chief and that sort of thing
and uh in the prison Jackson Mississippi
prison which is not bad by usual
standards I've been locked up myself in
worse prisons but uh as we were walking
down the Halls we passed one of these
huge cages you know lot of people in the
cages and uh they were all black black
men but as we walked past uh a child
tapped on the bars and asked happened to
be standing there asked me if I could
get him a drink of water so I turned to
the police chief and I said can I get
him a drink of water there's a fountain
down the hole so he said sure so he came
over and gave him a drink of water well
when we got back to the office to talk
to the chief we asked him what's that
kid doing in there so he asked some
clerk to look it up and it turned out
that they just found him in the streets
and they didn't know what to do with him
I so they put him in jail and he'll stay
there for the rest of his life now cases
like that are not counted you know but
they they're just part of the savagery
of imprisonment of the dangerous classes
and most you know very high percentage
of people in the prison are drug rated
offenses so you find a kid in rockbury
with a joint in his pocket you know
happens three times okay he's in jail
for who knows how many years has nothing
to do with reducing drugs you can see
that from the statistics but it does
have something to do with purifying the
Society of the people who we find
threatening the dangerous classes
usually people were crushing in one form
or another I don't see any other
rational interpretation of the so-called
War on
Drugs thank you Petra
