activism in the 60s did have a lasting
effect in generally civilizing the
society so women's rights gay rights
environmental concerns opposition to
aggression lots of things have changed
but it led to a reaction a very quick
reaction uh this is standard you take a
look back over history typically after
Wars and depression and so on there are
periods of crisis is you have activism
and then repression so after the first
world war you had woodro Wilson's
redcare the worst era of repression in
American history the depression in the
second world war led to a growth of
radical democracy all over the world and
it led to a serious repression it took
different forms in different places in
the United States it took the form of
the anti-communist Hysteria which is
called McCarthyism but it actually began
with the liberal Democrats McCarthy took
it to an extreme and we when he went too
far attacking powerful institutions he
was quickly destroyed but the general
anti-communist hysteria which is what it
was was used pretty much like Wilson's
Red Scare to undermine independent
thought to silence criticism to get
people back into line and so on the
Vietnam War had the same effect that by
the late 60s of the Vietnam War had
joined with other factors eliciting a
very substantial activism and protest
and it led to an immediate backlash the
activist movements were very bitterly
attacked the national political police
the
FBI were directed under four
administrations Kennedy and Johnson
through Nixon to attack and Destroy
independent activism they began of
course with the Communist party but that
was very marginal the American Indian
movement the Puerto Rican activism Civil
Rights Movement the anti-war movement
the early feminist movement the entire
new left the black nationalist movements
all were under severe attack by an
official government program of
repression co-intel Pro there's nothing
like that now and it went pretty far it
went as far as literal political
assassination and the crisis of
democracy that they saw was that there
was too much democracy too many people
were becoming active and engaged and
pressing their demands and interests in
the public Arena this posed a problem
because the state can't respond to all
of these and so we have a crisis of
democracy we have to have what they
called more moderation in democracy
people have to become passive more
apathetic they have to be spectators not
participants they were particularly
interested in what they call the failure
of the institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the schools
the universities churches are not
indoctrinating the young properly that's
why we have these demonstrations these
activisms these calls for rights and so
on so we have to introduce more
discipline and control in various ways
which um converged into what became the
the neoliberal economic and social
policies of the following generation so
in a way activism won major achievements
in cultural and social practices but
beaten back in the economic sphere today
opportunities and circumstances are much
greater because of the Legacy that was
won simply take women's rights the bare
beginnings of the feminist movement were
in the late 60s by now a lot of what was
regarded is something you had to
militantly fight about it's simply taken
for granted in the United States there
were anti-sodomy laws until a couple of
years ago and things have changed
substantially in those domains and that
makes a big difference there are plenty
of
opportunities what's necessary is will
that there's no single answer for
everyone no single this is the way to do
it for everyone it depends who you are
what your circumstances are are what
your concerns are uh uh where your
engagements are but the opportunities
are enormous and each individual just
has to answer that question how am I
going to use the opportunities available
to me to deal with the critical problems
of the world this coming generation is
facing questions that have never Arisen
in the history of the human species
there are threats to survival that are
very significant and that are imminent
the major ones are the threat of nuclear
war which is increasing it's kind of
almost a miracle that we've survived 70
years of this nuclear age and it's
getting worse and the other is the
Environmental catastrophe which is
looming and will come unless uh very
significant steps are taken to avert it
and reverse it these are decisions that
have to be made quickly and acted upon
so the respon responsibility of today's
generation is just colossal
extraordinary and can't be put
off what do you need to
survive water food clean air and shelter
and what about a job to pay for those
and the freedom of movement to find them
with the current state of divisive
politics growing corporate power and
escalating climate change these basic
needs face critical challenges so how
will that affect you how long will you
be able to access or afford these basic
human needs
