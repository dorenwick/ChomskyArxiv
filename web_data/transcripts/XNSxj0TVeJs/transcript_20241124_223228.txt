welcome Professor n Chomsky as our
distinguished visiting Humanities
lecturer this year this is the program
we began just a few years ago to bring
to our University some of the finest
Minds in the country in the spirit of
academic freedom in the spirit of
examining the great issues of the day
and it's hard to imagine a more
appropriate speaker uh than Nom
Chomsky um he has been in a
anyway a part of my life since I began
at Law School in
1971 I had at that time a very close
friend who had a PhD from MIT in
linguistics um and you may speculate why
she went bad and decided to go to law
school I can't answer that but I can say
I asked her who was the most impressive
professor of linguistics with whom she
had studied in mi
and in a nanc she said n
Chomsky he was a man whose
work in syntactic
structures uh has literally changed his
field he regarded as as one of the great
public intellectuals on that basis alone
but he has had a career as the
equivalent to our modern Socrates a
gadfly who has raised issues uh a across
a wide gut of topics always
uncompromising always Fearless always
willing to speak truth to power always
willing to raise sometimes uncomfortable
topics in uncomfortable ways um but
because of his
commitment a commitment
um as worthy of veneration as any to
proudly and sometimes defiantly speak
what he believes is the truth uh and to
try to advance all of
us in a recent work because we say so um
Henry jro in his forward stated and I
quote chomsky's role intellectually
educationally and politically is more
relevant now than ever given the need
for a display of Civic courage theoretic
riger and willingness to translate
oppression and suffering into public
concerns moreover he provides a model
for young people and others to
understand the importance of using ideas
and knowledge to intervene in Civic
political and cultural life making it
clear the democracy has to be struggled
over if it is going to
survive ladies and Gentlemen please join
me in welcoming n Chomsky
[Applause]
I'm too eager please please join me in
in in welcoming uh Professor William
Fitzpatrick who will
[Applause]
introduce boy was that a disappointment
for you right you're hoping for him you
get me well I know time is short so uh
and you're here to hear Professor
Chomsky not me so I'll be brief I
promise and we should have about a half
an hour for a Q&A at the end and there's
also a reception afterwards and I'll say
nearby at the Eisenberg rotunda and I'll
say more about that uh later so the
distinguished visiting humanist program
was established 5 years ago with a
generous commitment from uh president
Suman uh it's now a central feature of
our new Humanities Center which exists
uh in large part thanks to the
initiative and support of Dean Culver um
and I think this is a really wonderful
culmination of a rich and successful
first year for the center under Joanie
rubin's uh enlightened and energetic
leadership so many thanks to all of you
and to other people who uh helped
organize this and to the event staff uh
for making this
possible from the beginning the idea for
this program the distinguished visiting
humanist program was to find the very
most prominent and influential Scholars
um working on broadly humanistic
questions and to bring them to campus
for several days of talks and meetings
with various groups of Faculty students
and members of the Rochester Community
um we were told Reach for the Stars so
we did and boy did we get one gome
chomsky's commonly referred to is not
only the father of modern Linguistics uh
but is perhaps the most influential
public intellectual alive he's done Al
work in a variety of academic Fields And
as an equally uh well-known public
presence as an uncompromising social and
political critic over half a century
he's worked to expose the darker sides
of capitalism the hypocrisies of many
uses of political power and the
manipulations of information and
rhetoric that subvert meaningful
democracy his voice is at bottom I think
a distinctly and deeply moral one
insisting on the simple premise that
what really matters are human beings and
human development and
flourishing when it comes to powerful
human institutions and the policies that
govern them um they should always be
viewed uh through that lens the question
in every case being who is served by
them and how well and obviously we
should demand that they actually serve
Ordinary People and serve them well now
these may seem like truisms but as
Professor Chomsky has pointed out in
various contexts uh truisms are often
ignored or outright rejected in practice
and these are no
exception now the inspiration for
inviting Professor Chomsky as our
distinguished uh visiting humanist came
specifically from reading an account of
the recent Dewey lectures that he
delivered at Columbia University which
addressed uh some of the topics that
he'll be taking up today it's hard to
think of more fundamental and Central
humanistic questions than these what is
it that makes us distinctively human and
in particular what's the essence of
language which sets us so clearly apart
from other living
creatures how are the underlying
mechanisms of language related to human
creativity and what light might all of
this shed on the nature and potential
limits of human understanding as we
exercise our distinctive cognitive
capacities well this was exactly what we
were looking for right big questions at
the heart of humanistic inquiry explored
by one of the most prolific and
penetrating minds of our time
so it's my great pleasure now to give
you finally gome Chomsky who will speak
to us about language creativity and the
limits of understanding
[Applause]
in the uh early days of the modern
Scientific Revolution uh
Galileo and other leading 17th century
scientists
philosophers uh issued a critical
challenge for the study of language and
mind one that is still far from being
more than partially addressed
uh they were AED I'm now quoting by The
Marvelous invention of a means to
construct from 25 or 30 sounds an
infinite variety of Expressions which
although not having any resemblance in
themselves to that which passes through
our minds nevertheless do not fail to
reveal all of the secrets of the mind
and to make intelligible to others who
cannot penetrate into our minds all that
we conceive and all the diverse
movements of our
souls uh for decart this was a primary
difference between humans and any animal
or machine uh the Insight provided a
primary basis for his uh well-known Mind
Body
dualism facts that are still poor L
understood I'll actually return to that
uh later on the great uh humanist
linguist vilhelm Fon Hult conceived
language in his words to be a productive
activity that makes articulated sound
capable of expressing thought uh audible
signs for thought the words of William
Dwight Whitney a famous figure in 19th
century linguistics
uh for the last great representative of
this tradition uh Aro yerson about a
century ago uh the central question of
the study of language again his words is
how its structures come into existence
in the mind of a speaker on the basis of
limited finite experience yielding a
notion of structure that is definite
enough to guide him in framing sentences
of his own the crucially what he called
free Expressions that are typically new
to speaker and
hearer uh for convenience I'll refer to
this tradition as the Galilean challenge
taking a little bit of Liberty with
texts but uh not in a way that affects
the main
point uh the Galilean challenge is I
think of crucial significance for the
study of the nature and evolution of
language and the human mind uh one might
say I think without exaggeration uh that
it virtually defines the topic and that
any approach that doesn't at least try
to deal with the challenge is deeply
flawed and uh happens to cover a lot of
ground uh the Galilean challenge
concerns what has been sometimes called
the creative aspect ECT of language use
the distinctive human capacity to
construct in our minds an infinite
number of thoughts expressed in language
and to use them to reveal our thoughts
to others in ways that are appropriate
to
circumstances and we could add to bring
them to our own Consciousness sometimes
and our own understanding that's
actually crucial though very little
studied topic one for you students to
undertake direct new
directions uh human language and thought
are uh for this reason based on a
generative process which is my the
modern study of these topics uh
motivated by the Galilean challenge has
been called the generative Enterprise
it's an Enterprise which began to take
shape in the mid 20th century uh aided
by new theoretical understanding of the
nature of computational
systems the idea that uh human language
and human thought have a fundamental
creative aspect based on a generative
process was suggested as far as I know
for the first time by the 16th century
Spanish physician philosopher Juan HTE
who apparently influen
aart uh hate distinguished three kinds
of intelligence the lowest level is
shared by humans and animals and lacks
the creative
capacity the second level specific to
humans is based on a generative system
that underlies the normal use of
language in H's words people who have
this system can be seen inventing and
saying such things as they never heard
from their masters nor any
mouth that's the second level of
intelligence the third and highest level
is true creativity with aesthetic value
which He suggests might involve a
mixture of
Madness thoughts derived from Plato
originally uh in a recent discussion of
language and understanding ing the Dewey
lectures that bill mentioned I wrote
that uh honesty should lead us to
concede that we understand little more
about creativity than HTE did in the
16th century uh nor do we even know
whether the essential questions fall
within the scope of human understanding
or whether they are what uh David Hume
took to be Nature's ultimate secrets
consigned into that obscurity in which
they ever did and ever will remain uh
Hume was referring to the Newtonian
Scientific Revolution which had just
taken place based on invocation of
forces that Newton and his
contemporaries regarded as an absurdity
Newton's words for quite compelling
reasons which have only deepened in the
years since
quite interesting topic I'll put it
aside here uh relevant here is the
question to what extent the Galilean
challenge Falls within the reach of
potential human
intelligence uh I might add that it is
very commonly argued that there are no
limits to human intelligence uh there is
no ignorabimus as the great
mathematician philosopher David Hilbert
declared as he put it there are
absolutely no unsolvable problems
instead of the foolish ignorabimus our
answer is on the contrary we must know
we shall know words that are engraved on
his Tombstone and they're widely
accepted today particularly by those who
consider themselves to be scientific
naturalists that's always seemed to me
very strange not only for the reasons
that impelled John Lock David Hume Isaac
Newton himself to reject the conclusion
quite strong arguments but also because
more generally we are after all organic
creatures We're Not Angels so that all
of our capacities should be expected to
have limits which in fact are implicit
in the fact that they have scope so our
biological endowment uh permits us to
grow arms and legs but for exactly the
same reason it prevents us from growing
wings and the logic carries over to the
cognitive domain it's been discussed
significantly for one by one figure the
great 19th century philosopher logician
Charles Sanders Pur he argued
persuasively I think that our reasoning
in science and ordinary life is Guided
by what he called abductive principles
which crucially limit the range of the
hypotheses that we are capable of
entertaining otherwise he argues I think
again convincingly that learning and
Discovery would be impossible but these
very same principles render other
hypotheses either inaccessible or so
remote in some accessibility hierarchy
that they can't be entertained in fact
there's little reason to believe that we
have even the intellectual resources to
pose the correct questions a let alone
to find the answers and this being the
case as I think it is our Sciences can
be regarded as a domain of convergence
between our innate intellectual
capacities and the truths about the
world a convergence that might well be
partial apart from some biological
miracle and I think the close study of
language uh sheds uh some further light
on these matters one of its interests I
think well returning to the Galilean
challenge it's important to determine
which parts are amable to study and
which Parts lie Beyond reach quite
possibly for reasons that have to do
with limits of human understanding uh as
formulated the Galilean challenge
identifies thought with linguistically
formulable thought again the words of
the
challenge say that these 25 to 30 sounds
can reveal all that we conceive and all
the diverse movements of our Souls
that's an identification of thought with
linguistically expressable thought that
idea runs through a long tradition finds
expression today I think it's too
extreme there seems good evidence for
thought that's not linguistically
articulated or
articulable uh nevertheless what can in
principle be formulated in language is
surely a core component of what's
Loosely described as thought
and restricting ourselves to that we ask
what kind of mental structure would
satisfy the Galilean criteria and the
challenge for science is to discover
what this entity is how it functions and
if possible how it evolved how we happen
to have it uh on the latter Topic in uh
in recent years there's been a huge and
virgin
literature on evolution of language
there regular International conferences
uh numer many
Publications however it's rarely noted
that the topic doesn't exist uh
languages change but they don't evolve
and what evolved is something different
namely the capacity for language which
is part of the human biological
endowment each language is in
instantiation of the language capacity
just as each visual system individual
visual system is an instantiation of the
shared human visual capacity it's the
capacity that evolved and not its
instantiations uh you might think that
this is just a terminological point but
actually if you look further the problem
goes considerably deeper soon we see
that as soon as you look into the
literature on the topic and much of it
denies that there is a linguistic
capacity it adopts a principle which was
famously announced by prominent
psychologist linguist Michael thomaso
that the language capacity is dead there
is no such thing his actual words were
ug is dead which is exactly the same
thing ug Universal grammar is nothing
other than the theory of the language
capacity so if that's dead there's no
language capacity so in short much of
the field I think uh probably most of it
is based on the assumption that the
topic doesn't exist that may seem
uncharitable uh wor some thought uh
merits further discussion you might want
to look into it I'll put the question
aside here discussed it elsewhere uh the
Galilean challenge presupposes what's
been called in recent years the
biolinguistic program uh it assumes that
the language capacity is a real
biological entity it's a component of
the mind brain kind of parallel to the
visual capacity in others uh that that
was quite a departure from the
prevailing approaches of the uh
structuralist
Behavioral Science period 1940s and 50s
and also recent reincarnations of the
same conceptions but nevertheless if we
adopt this program the biolinguistic
program we at once face two Central
questions the question of
learnability as jerson emphasized and
since Darwin uh the question of
evolvability uh the study of
learnability and evolvability was given
quite solid grounding by Eric lenberg
old TR in his classic text biological
foundations of language uh came out in
1967 and among his many
contributions several are of particular
significance in the present
context uh lenberg reviewed the sharp
Divergence between human language and
the symbolic systems of other animals
and he also presented the first serious
comprehensive account of uh is this
working of the uh is this
working
loost Magic Touch why don't
youe we were just commenting that this
illustrates the limits of human
understanding
actually at uh I'm at MIT great
technological institution and at least
once during in commencement the whole
public addressing system breaks down
so and in fact the most interesting case
in my experience when I was giving uh
Memorial lectures for berand Russell at
Trinity College in Cambridge England and
in the middle um somebody ran up and
said we have to clear the whole room
there's a bomb threat so everybody went
outside came back a little later and
picked up where we where we had
left uh so this is kind of
mild well going back to Eric lenberg uh
to repeat he discussed the sharp
Divergence between human language and uh
any animal communication system and a
second topic the quite Sharp Divergence
between the human language capacity and
other human cognitive capacities many
cases some of which he discovered in
which one of them functions and the
other fails both directions these
discoveries and insights have been uh
considerably extended and deepened since
Leber's work uh he also discussed uh the
biological
plausibility of disc continuity in
evolution what's sometimes called
saltation uh was a radical idea at that
time it's a conclusion that's much
better grounded today and uh it's
actually a logical necessity to account
for the de emergence of systems like
human language which is a system of
discrete
Infinity uh as the Galilean challenge
recognized and that can't be uh can't
emerge in steps can't get from a small
number to Infinity by small steps and
this capacity this system of discrete
Infinity it may actually be unique uh
perhaps even in the biological world and
the root of others that are known such
as knowledge of arithmetic for for
example problem that very much bothered
Darwin uh the language capacity appears
to be a true species capacity unique to
humans in Essentials and invariant among
human groups uh the evidence is quite
persuasive that the language capacity
has not has undergone little probably no
evolutionary change at least since our
ancestors left Africa so estimated about
some 60,000 years ago and they're very
recent genomic studies last few months
in fact studies of African groups that
separated much earlier and these
indicate that there has been little or
no evolutionary change in the language
capacity for over a 100,000 years uh now
the human Homo sapiens emerged about
200,000 years ago and that Gap is
virtually nothing in evolutionary time
uh there's no evidence that uh anything
like the language capacity existed prior
to Homo sapiens so what what the
evidence indicates is that the language
capacity emerged pretty much with Homo
sapiens maybe simultaneous with it and
it hasn't changed since uh these facts
bear directly on the fundamental nature
of the language capacity the very
strongly suggest that the language
capacity whatever it is must be quite
simple at its core both because of its
apparently rapid emergence in The
evolutionary record and its resistance
to modification ever since now it's
because of the apparent universality and
stability of the language capacity that
the theory of the language capacity has
been called Universal grammar ug for
short it's recent decades that's
actually adapting a traditional notion
which had a different interpretation
adapting it to a new biological context
in current literature
unfortunately the universal grammar ug
is often confused with something
different namely generalizations that
are generally correct about surface
properties of languages it's quite an
interesting topic but a different one uh
another common
misunderstanding is that the argument
for particular thesis of ug is that they
hold
universally that could not be a very
good argument there could be many
reasons for universality for example
common origin uh the basic Arguments for
thesis of ug uh lie in the study of
learnability what's called Poverty of
stimulus in the study of language a
problem that arises in all forms of
growth and development the complexity of
the system that arises is not traceable
to properties of the data that
are that that that are the basis for it
so for example you can't derive the fact
that humans have a
Maman uh visual system not an insect
visual system them from uh looking at
the nutritional environment of the
embryo for example nobody believes that
and the same is true in the cognitive
domain uh well returning to the Galilean
challenge uh until mid 20th century the
challenge had been pretty much ignored
uh there's occasional notice of the kind
I mentioned and in fact doesn't go much
beyond that it's very occasional and
there was a good reason for it tools
were not available for even formulating
the challenge clearly uh that problem
was overcome by mid 20th century as a
result of great mathematical work by
girdle touring Church others which
established the theory of
computability on very firm grounds and
made it very clear how a finite system
can generate an infinite array of
objects
uh these discoveries made it possible
for the first time to capture precisely
some of the ideas that animated the
tradition and again I stress some of
them and I'll get back to that and to
pursue them effectively For the First
Time The Language capacity that has
evolved is a generative system that
yields an infinite array of structured
expression
that constitute thoughts linguistically
expressed and that can be externalized
into one or another sensory modality uh
typically that's
sound uh not necessarily as you can see
uh I'll keep the sound for convenience
but it's uh just one of possible
modalities the language doesn't seem to
care which modality use in the uh stand
standard terminology technical
terminology the generative system yields
representations at two interfaces with
other internal systems What's called the
conceptual intentional interface
provides linguistically formulated
thought kind of language of thought
sometimes it's called and the sensory
motor interfaces one or another modality
that provides modes for external izing
thought uh well let's start looking more
closely at the Galilean challenge
separating out those components that are
amable to study and those that are
beyond the realm of careful
inquiry now at least possibly
forever uh the first distinction is
between the generative system and the
use of the system familiar terms for
that are competence and performance
perance there is a legitimate
controversy about how competence and
performance interact in accounting for
particular phenomena but the distinction
itself is not in question it's an
elementary conceptual distinction it's
familiar in such simple areas as say
arithmetic so you and your laptop have
an internal generative system for
arithmetic
that's intrinsic competence uh you and
your laptop can access this system for
various actions say producing uh the
product of two numbers and in carrying
out multiplication or other arithmetical
operations there may be many deviations
from what the internal system determines
the reason is that all sorts of other
factors enter into actual performance
both for you and your laptop uh that
distinction between generation and
production is fundamental and quite
important to keep in
mind it's worth noting that the Galilean
tradition Challenge and the tradition
that followed from it didn't make the
distinction and they could not lacking
the 20th century clarification of the
nature of computability
the Galilean challenge as you can see
from the wording I quoted was formulated
in terms of production not generation
two very different
Notions
uh production is one of two aspects of
performance performance includes uh
input systems and output systems the
input systems are perception in case of
language parsing a technique for
determining the structure of the
sentence and the meaning of the sentence
from its physical character uh there's a
stand the output systems are production
a standard view uh is that the input
system uh parsing perception is uh
basically a reflex that's uh the phrase
of psycholinguist Merl Garrett Jerry
foder important philosopher described
this as the deepest observation he ever
heard about the mechanisms underlying
perception of speech it's the
inspiration for his influential
modularity theories which some of you
may know about which incidentally are
restricted to input systems if that's
accurate as it seems to be we can put it
aside here it's a very interesting topic
has quite far-reaching results but it's
unrelated to the Galilean challenge it's
a ref
and in fact the topic seems to have been
ignored in the tradition to which I
referred probably for this reason uh so
the Galilean challenge then reduces to
generation intrinsic competence and to
production well let's take production
the other aspect of performance uh we
can stare at the problem but there's
nothing much of interest to say about it
uh at least those aspects of production
that have been at the Heart That
animated the Galilean challenge through
the centuries what I call the creative
aspect of language use the use of
language that is appropriate to
circumstances but not determined by them
fundamental distinction so in cartisian
terms we may be in incited or inclined
to speak in certain ways but we are not
compelled to do so fundamental
distinction and that is true more
generally of voluntary action actually
the problem is expressed graphically in
a recent review of the state-of-the-art
by two leading neuroscientists who work
on voluntary action Milo bitti Robert
aaman they write I'm quoting them we
have some idea as to the intricate
design of the puppet and the puppet
strings but we lack insight into the
mind of the Puppeteer what's making it
happen they're concerned with very
simple cases like say the decision to
lift your finger to shift your eye gaze
uh and it's dramatically true in the
vastly more complex case of production
of language so if you consider a an
aphorism of v f humble now sometimes
quoted that Lang language involves
infinite use of finite means we now have
some idea about the means that are used
the internal language the puppet and the
strings uh but uh it's the generative
process but not the infinite use not the
Puppeteer as in the case of voluntary
motion generally fundamental questions
about the use of the means by the
Puppeteer remain shrouded in
mystery uh the matter is often
misinterpreted in current scientific
work for example there's good deal of
work comparing speech and uh
organization of actual speech and
organization of other actions uh
contrary to what's assumed in this work
that would tell us virtually nothing
about language it would tell us
something about the organization of the
particular Act of speaking which of
course is going a share properties with
other acts but tells us nothing about
the fundamental the generative system
the creative aspect of language use
actually there are serious
misinterpretations even in the finest
academic
scholarship happens to be a case in
point in an article that just appeared
on decart by one of the leading Scholars
of early modern philosophy John
Cottingham Cottingham actually is
unusual in that he recognizes that the
creative aspect of language use provided
uh a basis for decart's mind body
dualism and he also recognizes and this
is rare that it was an empirical
argument concerning the limitations of
any machine all of which is correct but
the way he puts it is interestingly
incorrect I'll quote it the way he puts
it is that deart believed that a machine
could not possibly generate the
indefinitely large range of responses
needed for genuine thought or language
but he goes on to say that a touring
machine which is basically your laptop
can run an in indefinite number of
programs and Tackle an indefinite number
of tax tasks and thus has new technology
refuted old arguments so cutting ham
concludes but it doesn't uh deart could
easily have handled the fact would not
have been surprised by the fact that a
machine can uh generate uh infinitely
many uh responses he was interested in
something else quite different the
limits of a machine are that they cannot
and de cart's words respond
appropriately to
circumstances not that it was finitely
bounded that was not a concern in the
17th century uh he was concerned with
the difference between being incited or
inclined to speak in certain ways and
being compelled to do so the machine is
compelled the person is only incited or
inclined and somehow chooses the
Puppeteer somehow chooses to act
appropriately that's the mystery the
problem that's the question that
animated the Galilean Challenge from the
beginning still does and the Puppeteer
still escapes our intellectual grasp in
fact it's not even clear that we know
how to formulate the questions properly
uh simple cases of voluntary motion like
say raising your finger deciding to
raise your finger those are mysterious
enough but there's something almost
magical about production of a sentence
or an internal thought which you don't
bother
externalizing uh if you think about it
for a minute this uh if you produce a
sentence
sorry oh oh okay how's that yeah okay uh
well go back a sentence uh the simple
voluntary actions like um shifting your
eye gaze or lifting your finger the
decision to carry them out are totally
mysterious uh but the question becomes
vastly more complex in fact uh kind of
almost magical when you think about
construct producing in your mind a
complex sentence sometimes externalizing
it if you think about it the sentence
that you produce emerges instantaneously
in all of its complexity with no
awareness of any acts of composing it in
your mind and if in fact we by now know
a good deal about the intricacies of
what's going on when it's composed in
the mind but no one can become conscious
of this uh can't become conscious of
these internal mental acts and the only
plausible conclusion is that the act of
formulating
thoughts sometimes externalizing them in
sound uh these acts are unconscious uh
inaccessible to
Consciousness uh nonetheless the
Puppeteer appears to be acting freely
and independently and somehow
appropriately here the Mysteries just
abound well we're led to conclude from
all of this that performance actually
does not bear on the Galilean challenge
in the case of production because it's
Out Of Reach and its interesting aspects
in the case of parsing and perception
because it's well within reach and an
important topic but not relevant to the
challenge so we're therefore left with
competence on the generative system the
internal language computational system
that generates something like a language
of thought at the conceptual intentional
interface and instructions for artic
culation or other actions at the sensory
motor
interface that's where we are left in
trying to deal with the Galilean
challenge well take a look at that uh
any computational system has consists of
atomic elements that are unanalyzed for
the purposes of the computation and a
procedure so-called recursive procedure
that forms more complex objects so let's
take a look at the atoms constituting
what's technically called the Lexicon uh
the atoms include the minimal meaning
bearing elements of language and here
again we Face fundamental perhaps
insuperable problems the terms and
concepts of human thought and human
language appear to have no counterpart
in animal communic iation systems in all
animal systems there's invariably a
direct correlation between the symbol
say an animal call and some identifiable
mind external event uh say the cries of
a monkey can be elicited by uh
fluttering of Leaves we take that to be
a predator warning call monkeys start
running away or say by some hormonal
change that we take that to mean I'm
hungry or something like that uh and so
on that generalizes without known an
exception including the B complicated B
Communication System but all that's
radically false for human language
that's a matter that becomes quite
evident when you consider the simplest
most fundamental elements that are used
to talk about the world to refer to
relate thoughts to the non-linguistic
world these elements simply do not
conform to What's called the
representationalist doctrine the
doctrine that there's a direct relation
between the symbols of thought and
language and some mind external thing
that's a Doctrine that's almost
universally adopted in the related
disciplines captured in the titles of
classic modern works such as U WV quin's
Worden object Roger Brown's Worden
things and the doctrine does apparently
hold for animal systems but it fails
completely for human systems for the
elements of human thought and language
uh they just don't pick out mind
independent objects no time to go into
it but it's quite striking and in fact
it was understood long ago it was
understood and discussed in Classical
Greece
was explored in the 17th and 18th
century British philosophical Classics
Lo Hume and others but it's been largely
forgotten in the modern period and
because of the force of the
representationalist doctrine I think we
could say Dogma because of the force of
that Dogma the uh inquiry into these
elements has really not been seriously
uh undertaken
the nature of the elementary terms and
Concepts has barely been explored and as
far as their evolutionary origin is
concerned that's a complete mystery
interesting important topic but I'll put
that one aside too lack of time uh
carving away what is irrelevant to the
Galilean challenge or what is beyond
reach what's left to investigate is the
nature and evolutionary origin of the
recursive procedure that generates the
two interface
representations and that in fact has
been the major topic of inquiry since
the Galilean challenge was undertaken
first addressed in the mid 20th century
well in the uh prevailing structuralist
Behavioral Science environment uh it was
generally assumed at the time 40s and
50s that the nature of language was
quite well understood and that was what
remained was sort of to fill in the
details for the various language of the
world which it was assumed could vary
limitlessly in
character as soon as the first attempts
were made to describe languages in ways
that satisfy the Galilean criteria with
what are called generative of grammars
it was very quickly discovered that the
opposite was more nearly true almost
nothing was understood and serious
puzzles abounded everywhere the first
attempts to deal with the problem to
construct generative grammars were
extremely complex simply in order to try
to capture newly discovered and quite
surprising data but it was always
understood that this cannot be correct
because of the problems of learnability
and evolvability that are always lurking
in the background well over the years
considerable simplification has been
carried out while the empirical range of
inquiry has been greatly extended both
in depth and scope I won't run through
the history but it seems that now we're
Maybe able for the first time to address
the Galilean Challenge in a more
principled way to ask how far can we go
with the simplest possible assumptions
so we therefore explore what has been
called the strong minimalist thesis
smt which suggests as an ideal that the
system that emerged pretty much along
with Homo sapiens was close to perfect
satisfying general principles of
computational efficiency basically laws
of nature but with no selectional
pressures which would introduce
complexities so it'd be basically kind
of like a snowflake which assumes its
complex structure just because of laws
of nature doesn't evolve to become like
that well in pursuing this course we're
actually following the standard model of
the Sciences which is based on the
recognition that greater Simplicity
translates into deeper explanation uh
we're also following the Galilean Maxim
which is driven modern science that
nature is basically simple and it's the
task of the scientist to show that and
if the scientist hasn't shown that
something's wrong uh there's a relevant
comment by the late uh Prince physicist
John Wheeler who points out that by
pushing a theory to its extremes we also
find where the cracks in its structure
must be hiding uh that's the Viewpoint
that guides current astronomy according
to astrophysicist Pedro Ferrera and in
the case of language this stance is
independently motivated by what's known
about the evolution of the language
capacity it's apparently
quite sudden emergence in evolutionary
history essentially simultaneous with
Homo sapiens and its stability since as
I already mentioned so turning to the
simplest recursive operation which is
buried somewhere in every computational
system what it does is take objects that
are already constructed uh to in the
simplest case and it forms a new one at
adding no additional structure not
changing either that's the core of
computation basically binary set
formations what's called merge in recent
literature so the question we can ask is
how far can we go in explaining basic
properties of language with just this
operation the core operation of any
computational system and the answer turn
out is pretty far
surprisingly uh I won't run through the
details it's rather technical but I'll
just mention some of the consequences of
adopting a simplest assumption for the
computational system of internal
language I'm not try to demonstrate this
here that's done elsewhere but just talk
about what the results are uh one
consequence is a solution to a
longstanding puzzle called uh the puzzle
of structure dependence of rules which
is a highly puzzling phenomenon which
was never noticed until the first
efforts were made to construct
generative grammars uh back around the
1950s uh the puzzle is that linguistic
operations universally ignore the very
simple computation of linear distance
and they use instead the much more more
complex computation of structural
distance those of you who saw Michelle
gondry's film last night the title was
is the man who is tall happy which is
one illustration of this extremely
puzzling property take an even simpler
example uh consider the sentence birds
that fly instinctively swim it's
ambiguous could mean fly instinctively
or or instinctively swim now suppose you
extract the adverb put it in the front
and you get int instinctively birds that
fly swim that's unambiguous it means
instinctively swim not instinctively fly
which means that the adverb is ignoring
the linearly closest verb fly and it's
selecting the structurally closest verb
swim which is a much more comp Le Lex
computation uh that holds for all
languages all relevant constructions
there happens to be uh interesting
supporting evidence in this case from
neuroscience and psycholinguistics could
mention if you like there's only one
known explanation for these quite
striking facts the explanation is that
ug satisfies the strong minimalist
thesis from that assumption it just
follows
it follows that linear order is just
never entertained by the child learning
a language never choose never considers
that option in Computing the uh language
of thought the conceptual intentional
interface in fact linear order and other
arrangements appear to be properties
that are imposed by the sensory motor
system so we can't talk in parallel
uh we can't uh articulate structures so
the internal computations that yield the
linguistically expressable thoughts the
language of thought they have to be
externalized in a way that passes
through the sensory motor filter sensory
meet sensory motor conditions these are
quite independent of language have
nothing to do with language they were in
place in The evolutionary record long
before language emerged sign language as
you can see uh involves somewhat
different Arrangements because the
medium simply allows other
options uh another consequence of the
strong minimalist thesis is an
explanation for the ubiquitous property
of what's called
displacement phrases appear in one place
but they're interpreted both there and
somewhere else so for example in the
sentence which books did John read we
interpret the phrase which books where
we hear it and also as the object of
read so the meaning of the sentence is
something like for which books X John
read the books X interpret it in both
positions and these results can become
quite intricate when you take sentences
of any minimal complexity well this has
always been assumed to be a strange
imperfection of human language it's a
property you would never build into
artificial systems like computer
languages or metamathematical systems uh
so why is it there well there are
various notations for expressing it one
can discuss their advantages and
disadvantages but that's kind of beside
the point the real question is why is it
there in the first place that's rarely
addressed but it does turn out to follow
directly from this strong minimalist
thesis another quite surprising result
and as a side benefit it happens to give
the correct forms for semantic
interpretation as in the example that I
just gave which books did he read if you
take a look at what's generated it's
which books did John read which books
which is directly interpreted that's for
linguists the so so-called copy theory
of movement uh phenomenon called
reconstruction in the technical
literature and it all fall falls out
immediately from the uh uh from the
strong minimalist thesis and another
rather related consequence of the thesis
is a very striking disparity between
what's generated at the thought
interface and the sensory motor
interface informally what reaches the
mind and what reaches the ear
what reaches the mind are the forms
appropriate for semantic
interpretation for reasoning for
inference for planning thought language
of thought again that what reaches the
ear causes severe problems for parsing
and perception for one reason because of
the deletion of copies which happens to
be in Conformity with a minimal
computation
strong minimalist thesis again so again
in the simple example I gave what
reaches the mind is which books John
read which books directly interpretable
what reaches the ear is which books John
read that has a gap in it and the Gap
has to be filled in by the hearer or the
automatic parser and that task becomes
quite intricate when you go beyond the
simplest examples in fact these
so-called filler Gap problems are among
the most complex problems for automatic
parsing and uh also for perception uh
more generally turns out that whenever
there's a conflict between computational
efficiency and communicative
efficiency uh communicative efficiency
is sacrificed it's just nobody pays any
language doesn't pay any attention to it
uh to put it a bit metaphorically
language seems to be designed for
internal thought not for
use uh and uh the internal
linguistically constructed thought need
not appear consciously in externalized
form it's another matter that deserves
more explanation more exploration I'll
put it aside here uh these conclusions
lead directly uh to to another another
conclusion namely that uh a widely held
Doctrine is incorrect namely that the
prime function of language is
communication and that language evolved
as an animall likee communication system
that appears to be quite
incorrect rather it seems increasingly
clear that language is primarily an
instrument of of thought with such uses
as communication a kind of secondary
ancillary phenomenon that is yet another
striking dissociation between human
language and animal symbolic systems and
more generally there's mounting evidence
that there's a fundamental asymmetry
between the two interfaces a generation
of the thoughts is the core of language
and the mapping of the core uh language
to the sensory motor system is ancillary
its properties are substantially a
reflex of the sensory motor system which
again evolved long before language
emerged and probably has little or
nothing to do with language well what we
would expect then is that
externalization to the sensory motor
system would be complex
why because it's relating to unrelated
systems core internal language which is
maybe kind of a snowflake and the
sensory motor systems which are around
for a long time before language and it
does seem correct it seems that the
complexity the diversity the easy
mutability of language resides largely
and perhaps will discover someday
completely in ex externalization so when
you learn a second language or for that
matter when a child acquires the first
language the task is to to acquire the
externalization that includes the
arbitrary assignment of sound to lexical
items word order morphological patterns
peculiarities irregular verbs and so on
there's no way to learn the principle of
structure to dependence or the Curious
phenomena of say quantifier variable
interaction and reconstruction or the
properties of expressions of more than
the minimal con complexity or for that
matter even the meanings of Words which
are incomparably more intricate than
what than the hints that you find in
even the most uh extensive dictionary
say the OED Oxford uh the the biggest of
the
dictionaries all of this is uh simply
unlearnable uh it appears that the core
system of the uh uh that yields the
language of thought is probably uniform
among languages or virtually so perhaps
even satisfying something like the
strong minimalist thesis and that
conclusion if it turns out to be true
should not be too surprising since the
child who's learning a language has
virtually no evidence about any of this
often literally none so it has to derive
from what uh David Hume called the
original hand of nature in our terms
some rewiring of the brain probably
simultaneous with the emergence of homo
sapiens tracing ultimately to some
genetic endowment uh just what this
biological endowment is remains unknown
and that too is not surprising
biologists have observed that even for
far simpler traits finding their genetic
basis must can be
fishlyn
book uh but in this case it's perhaps at
least potentially within the range of
inquiry well in General to conclude uh
the strong minimalist thesis yields
quite Rich consequences there a vast
range still unexplored in anything like
these terms which means that there's a
vast range of work compelling
challenging work within the range of
inquiry and deep Mysteries that lie
beyond the Galan challenge can be
partially met and in revealing ways but
we're very far from addressing the
concerns of the suggestive though often
obscure tradition and there's no
guarantee that they're even within the
potential reach of human inquiry in part
because the evidence may be unattainable
but in part because of our intrinsic
limitations as organic creatures that
roughly seems to me the general lay of
the land today thank
[Applause]
[Applause]
you good so we have about 20 minutes
q and a microphone there one there and
one there so a few people would like to
line up I would ask you to please keep
the questions brief so we can get in as
many uh as we
can okay start
with I am
intrigued by the statement that our
biological endowment does not give us
the ability to grow
wings and the observation that it does
give us us the ability through a lengthy
process of bootstrapping to build a
machine that has wings that has a
machine that has wings an airplane we
build tools with which we build more
complex tools with which we build yet
more complex tools that eventually allow
us to build an airplane and I'm left
wondering how much of that process
applies in the cognitive domain to what
extent may we be able to build machines
that help us conceive new machines that
help us conceive new machines and
eventually understand things that as
biological organisms alone we cannot
understand good question uh and in fact
that's uh the question I'm sorry is is
this can you hear me yeah I'll be a
little closer uh what you're describing
is in fact what interested early modern
science so Leonardo da Vinci conceived
of an airplane couldn't build it at that
time but he could conceive of it uh the
thinking of the early modern Revolution
Galileo up through Newton uh which is
the foundations of modern science was
based on what was called the mechanical
philosophy the idea that the world is a
machine the universe is a machine the
kind of thing that could be constructed
by a master Craftsman and in fact was
constructed by the ultimately skilled
master
Craftsman now that was what uh L that
was the fundamental idea of the modern
Scientific Revolution so Galileo for
example argued that if you can't
construct a machine and machine means
just what you're describing gears levers
you things pushing and pulling each
other and so on if you can't construct
the machine to explain some natural
phenomenon you
failed and in fact he felt at the end of
his life
that his scientific career was a failure
because he was not able to construct a
machine to account for the tides or the
motion of the heavenly bodies and so on
and that goes right through up to Newton
and Newton's great discovery was the
world isn't a
machine it's not a machine it has what
we're called
occult uh
elements forces like action at a
distance or repulsion at a distance and
that's not part the machines can't do
that so the amazing Discovery is the
world simply isn't a machine Newton as I
mentioned regard this as a complete
absurdity he never accepted it spent the
rest of his life trying to disprove it
uh other great scientists of the day
regard it as ridiculous livets hyans and
so on and uh for a long time afterwards
the scientist did did try to show
somehow that the mechanical science
could account for the world ultimately
Newton's proofs were just became
scientific common sense that people gave
up the Enterprise and science changed
radically from trying to show that the
world is intelligible to us which was
given up to trying to show that we can
construct theories that are intelligible
to us and that's something quite
different it's a radical change in the
nature of science that took place it was
understood by lock and Hume now that's
why Hume in his if you read his history
of England where has a chapter on Newton
you know the greatest genius who ever
appeared he points out that his great
achievement to was to lift the veil from
some of the mysteries of nature but to
show that there are other Mysteries
which we will never penetrate
which turns out to be correct uh science
has just changed its objectives it's
lowered them and when you come to your
question we just don't know uh can it
there's every reason to suppose I think
that cognitive capacities are like all
other capacities they're biological
capacities and it's just part of the
logic of a biological capacity that if
it has any scope at all it's going to
have have limits the reason it has scope
is because of some of its intrinsic
properties so we have intrinsic genetic
properties that determine that from the
nutrition of the cell of the embryo we
end up with the Maman visual system but
by that same token these same properties
tell us that no matter what the
nutrition of the embryo we're not going
to get an insect visual System Scope and
limits are logically related and that
actually was P's Insight that I quoted
about abductive principles he's often
misunderstood so in modern contemporary
philosophy a p's argument philosophers
among you will know is often interpreted
as uh what's called inference to the
best explanation but that's not what he
said at all what he discussed was the
idea which I think is plausible that you
can't learn or discover anything unless
there's some initial limitation of the
hypothesis space you have there it has
to somehow be limited to particular
hypotheses and in support of this he
discussed the history of Science and he
points out that if you look at
scientific
revolutions uh quite typically when
particular circumstances exist a
particular level of understanding
particular problems being formulated
there often many people who come to
pretty much the same conclusion some of
them get their first and we attribute it
to them but others are pretty near and
the reason he argued is that these
conditions are uh are somehow putting in
operation our internal abductive
principles you didn't know what they
were and we don't know what they are
that limit the hypothesis space so you
explore certain hypotheses and not an
infinite number of others that are
consistent with evidence and the same
has to be true of learning just couldn't
get off the ground unless the child's
hypothesis space is highly limited and
in fact we're coming to understand very
limited so that gets to your question
how far can our abductive principles
reach and put a cbor reach farther thank
you we'll move over here next question
yes uh Professor chsky uh I'm wondering
about um the concept of when we feel
that we understand or grasp or make
sense of something that we've been told
or observe and if I understood you
correctly you said that there is
evidence that there is thought without
language and I'm wondering if that
process would fit into that if you could
just say a little bit more about thought
without language and and if how that
relates to our feeling if that's the
right word it may not be the right word
of when we understand or grasp something
I'm I didn't what what's the Rel ation
between language and the feelings that
we have when we when we understand
somethings to be done without it can be
done without language it appears I'm
wondering if that relates to your point
that there is some evidence that we
can't think without the use of language
we can sorry we can we can have uh we
can think without the use of language
think can think without the use of
language well I mean just take say
ordinary circumstances so uh suppose I'm
trying to figure out how to get to work
in the morning uh I live in Boston and
like other cities in the United States
everything's collapsing uh
infrastructure is disappearing it's
beginning to look like the third world
so there's going to be a lot of detours
you know construction here this is going
to be blocked and kind of
instantaneously in your mind you work
out various images of possible ways to
get through this maze you just can't
articulate that in words
but I think that's thought and I think
there are a lot of things like that the
idea that language is strictly thought
though it is the traditional View and
it's still articulated it just doesn't
seem to me to conform to simple
introspection thank you
um hi um so there's recently been a
program developed to try to change U
machine learning from a set of rules to
to basically probabilistic guessing um
do you think this type of program could
be used to teach uh computer language
and if not what aspects of language do
you think would fail to be replicated
through probabilistic models yes I mean
there's there's a place for
probabilistic models in the study of
language or study of anything but but it
doesn't carry very far uh the the
fundamental problems remain the same so
probabilistic models just tell you
nothing nothing about the creative
aspect of language use about the Gap the
fundamental gap between incited and
inclined and compelled now there is a
place for them and in fact there's
interesting work on it so some of the
most interesting work on language
acquisition by Charles Yang in this case
linguist psychologist at the University
of Pennsylvania
uh he it it's pretty clear that a child
uh approaches the problem of language
acquisition by having all possible
languages in its head it doesn't know
which language it's U it's being exposed
to and as data comes along that class of
possible languages reduces so certain
data comes along and the mind
automatically says okay it's not that
language it's some other language and
effect we find in the children's in
literature on child acquisition and
experiments with child acquisition it's
been discovered that at various stages
Lang children are imitating possible
languages that they've never heard so at
some stage a child May English-speaking
child can be producing sentences of the
kind that appear say in Italian or in
German because it just doesn't know yet
it's never heard any data saying that
that's the way it ought to be but that
hasn't been ruled out yet so the child
is producing things that are never uh
never experiences in the local language
but they remain uh still not ruled out
now if you work out the method of ruling
out languages you do introduce
probabilistic inference and it can lead
to some interesting results as in Yang's
work so there there's nothing wrong
statistical INF just doesn't carry it
very far thank
you Professor chsky this is going to
seem like a selfish departure from the
topic at hand but I wanted to follow up
on a question I was asking you yesterday
I made the connection between uh
crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter
and the uh Bernie Sanders campaign and
the way they're financing it it's not
about that uh I wanted to ask you to
connect it to your work I was reading
your book Power Systems the other day
and you were talking about
workers uh actually taking back
factories in their area that have been
abandoned by corporations that have gone
to other countries and I wanted to
because when I asked you the question
you said The more important power is
like the force of a political revolution
and that's true but I wonder whether the
Bernie Sanders campaign would have had
the success that it did if people didn't
feel first of all that they could click
a button and feel that they were
contributing money and that they were
participating in an organization that
they had a stake in because it was a
monetary stake so I'm asking about the
Absurd notion of a Kickstarter campaign
to say buy back abandoned factories like
what you were mentioning in the book is
happening in Spain or something this is
a very real issue yeah it happens over
and over that uh some multinational will
close down an operation which happens to
be profit making but not at the level
which satisfies the bookkeeping needs of
the
multinational and very often uh worker
unions or organized workers have said
okay we'll buy the factory and keep
running it ourselves and it'll make
enough profit for us to live on we'll be
fine and uh what happens typically is
the multinational
refuses I think for class reasons they
would actually make money
if they sold the factory to the workers
but that introduces the idea that
working people can just take over the
factories and run them by themselves and
that's a dangerous idea actually that's
an idea that comes straight out of
Classical liberalism so John Stewart
Mill for example you know leading figure
of Classical liberalism advocated that
uh in a good Society properly run
libertarian society that working people
ought to run their own Industries and uh
there are examples that are working in
the old Rust Belt in the United States
you know Indiana Ohio a lot of
abandoned one of the reactions to the
abandonment of factories has been to
begin worker-owned
Enterprises that uh relate to the
growing Services economy so let's say a
Cooperative laundry to fun and uh
universities and other institutions in
the Cleveland area and things like that
it's proliferating there's interesting
work on it by garl peritz and others so
it's certainly possible in fact it could
have been possible with the Auto
industry if you look back a couple of
years ago uh the Auto industry was
collapsing and the government basically
took it over there were a couple of
choices possible at that point one
choice which was the one that was was
made was for the taxpayer to fund it and
hand it back essentially to the old
management different names but basically
the same and have them continue to
produce what they'd been producing
before namely
automobiles uh a different alternative
would have been to hand the Auto
industry over to the workforce and have
them produce something that the country
desperately needs which is high-speed
transportation
United States is way Bey behind most of
the rest of the world even countries
like China in lacking efficient
high-speed transportation systems that
would be good for the population be good
for the workforce be good for the
environment but it violates class
interests and since there was no public
support for it what was done was just to
restore the old system at taxpayer
expense but it didn't have to be that
way at the depends on how people like
you will respond to the
situation have for one last
question hi um I want to bring it back
to Linguistics um I'm interested in the
atoms or the items that are related by
merge for a language like English that's
reasonably things like words but what
about in a language like Navajo where
the words are massive conglomerations of
all sorts of very idiosyncratically
combined bined pieces of meaning what
what are the atoms for merge in a
language like that uh probably the same
there is U as you may know there's there
is study of this one of the uh most
interesting books is by Mark Baker
Princeton linguist it's called the atoms
of language and he's concerned Mark
former student is uh has been very much
concerned all of his academic career
with languages that have huge words what
are called polysynthetic languages and
uh what he's what he's argued is that
there's a basic
core option of choice that languages
have what's called a parameter which is
called the polysynthesis parameter and
language can pick one or the other
either way they use merge they put
things together by taking pieces and
making bigger Theses in the
polysynthetic languages
which give the Imp superficial
impression of free word order what
actually is happening is something
different the complex word actually has
in it the elements the meaning bearing
elements so what looks like a word is
actually a complex sentence and those
meaning bearing elements are keyed to
things on the
outside which could be a big phrase
let's say and they're linked by formal
means to the element inside that's
performing the sematic function and what
they tell you is this big thing out here
is what's performing the sematic
function and that gives you the
impression of free what's called free
word order because these things could
appear all over the place but they're
linked to things that have very definite
structure hierarchical structure so
essentially the basic structure is in
this big thing called the poos synthetic
word and there are linkages to Pieces
floating around on the outside which
fulfill the functions that are
determined by what they're linked to by
some formal element so it turns out to
be pretty much like English type
languages with this slight difference
and Mark's argument is universal grammar
is basically fixed so with that let's
thank our speaker
[Applause]
