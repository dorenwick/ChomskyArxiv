okay
good morning though
hi so
uh
talking about uh things just getting
straight to it uh Sunrise movement is
going into a phase of what I would call
renewal in terms of uh
recruiting in schools and recruiting in
communities
uh
the fight for what we call climate
Justice is uh
something quite urgent as you know
um and I'm wondering what you say uh
what what is the state of where we're at
in this fight what do you see when
you're looking
well I should perhaps Begin by saying
that the person who really ought to be
talking to I think is my daughter
Aviva who is just doing a lot of work on
climate Justice Just as an important
book on it
uh
I mean as she and others point out it's
not just a matter of
science
I mean
you can think of ways of cutting back
eating the atmosphere the question is
how it's going to be done that
will allow people to
survive in a decent way even move to a
better world
so one thing
it surely has to be done actually my
colleague Bob pollen has been doing a
lot of work on this is ensuring
transition programs for people who are
going to be
losing
their jobs as
fossil fuels are reduced so we hope
unfortunately they're not being reduced
but we have to get to the point where
we're cutting back sharply on
fossil fuels and that will of course
mean
potential hardships for communities
and have to work with them to overcome
that as I say Bob has been quite
successful on that even getting the um
Mine Workers Union and
West Virginia number of unions in
Californian
[Music]
so higher to
Advocate transition programs which will
train workers for
different than in fact better jobs
that's crucial for getting first of all
it's just necessary on human grounds but
even tactically it's necessary to
overcome
natural kinds of opposition to
taking the steps that have to be taken
uh
there's also a huge problem I don't know
how to overcome this of getting the rich
countries to agree to provide
substantial funding for the poor
countries of the world to deal with the
critical problems
uh if they aren't we all die
it's not just altruism uh but uh you
know substantial part of the
emissions are coming from poorer
countries trying to deal with
impossibly difficult problems unless
they have
uh significant Aid they're not going to
be able to do it and they could do it
like Africa which is the fastest growing
continent
could uh
simply leap over the fossil fuel stage
just as many countries have done with
the communications you don't have to go
through all the stages that the West
went through you can go immediately to
more advanced stages like
iPhones instead of electric instead of
wires overground
and similarly
solar energy instead of the whole fossil
fuel infrastructure
there's of course
a very powerful interests opposed to
that
the fossil fuel Industries and
everything
around them but
it's just got it can be done and it's
just got to be done or else not only
they will be a disaster for them but
we'll all be gone
and unfortunately it's going right in
the opposite direction now we haven't
got a lot of time
there's also a major problem problem
of
simply disinformation which is part of
something much broader
The General
breakdown of the whole social order
is so extreme that
people just distrust everything
uh I mean by now it's to the point where
people are refusing to give their
children measles vaccines
because who knows what those scientists
in the Deep state are up to
and you know you can really destroy the
society that way in fact the death toll
is going way up
Sunrise movement is
currently focusing on recruit against
schools
um from what I've understood about
student activism there are certain
problems we could talk about those but
the history of student activism can be
quite serious as far as I know
um and I think about SDS and I think
about Snick as well and I'm wondering if
um expectations or conditions like that
could be replicated today
not only could be but it's being
replicated now you look around the world
it's young people students who are out
there
in the global climate strike and
Extinction rebellion and the protests at
the
the cup meetings and so on uh they're
the ones who are out in front
uh in the schools you're going to run
into a problem in the United States
and that is with the strong
anti-education programs of the G of the
Republicans they want to destroy the
schools
make sure that the schools don't do
anything except teach
patriotism and reading and writing you
know but and you've got these
AstroTurf organizations like the moms
for schools that prevent The Grooming of
children all this kind of stuff it's
it's unfortunately it's not a joke
in the uh and it's not just the United
States
like we happen to spend some time in
Brazil where the right wing is very much
like the GOP here
and the minister of families in the uh
bolsonaro Administration was giving
speeches to
Evangelical churches
about how the
Workers Party is training children for
oral sex
that's uh and
you know talking to these huge groups of
evangelicals who just believe what their
Pastor tells them
well that's a general phenomenon it's
bad in the United States not alone
and it's getting worse with the uh
basically with the whole social
breakdown
that was kind of striking in the last
election
that the Democrats lost even more of the
working class than they had already
uh there's it's not the
SE people just don't see anything there
for them Democrats are over nothing the
Republicans at least offered guns and
that's going to be a huge problem
huge but uh not insurmountable I imagine
um in the past better not be interested
but we should recognize that it's not
just climate change
it's across the board
sure
when uh you talk about student movement
and you talk about the climate strength
it makes me
turn perhaps there's more hope in
thinking globally for Sunrise and that
maybe some some sort of bottom up
internationalist Alliance of some kind
could be built around the pursuit of
climate Justice
um I don't know
I know Earth strike has aimed towards
something like that but do you know much
more about that
well there was
the global climate strike which was a
move in the right direction
I don't know
how much
has developed from it but you're quite
right there should be an international
movement of young people reaching to the
poorer countries to Africa to Asia uh
I mean parts of the world are really
facing a
desperate situation
I'm in South Asia it's just going to be
unlivable
the large parts of Africa are going to
be unlivable
I'm at one of the worst which is
apparently I just happen to be giving
talks and
Egypt and Israel recently the
virtual Talks Of course and
so I was talking about the eastern
Mediterranean
which is heating up much more rapidly
than other parts of the world
and predictions now are that unless
radical changes are made by the end of
the century the Eastern Mediterranean
the sea level will have risen
two to two and a half meters
correctly wipes out the countries
the populations they're all along the
shore
it's not very far off that's the
lifetime of young people today
how would we go about formalizing some
kind of International Alliance
yeah
personal contacts
now a lot easier with
social mediately I can give talks in
Cairo and Tel Aviv like I did last week
and people who are organizing can do the
same
and
a major International
uh
Global
strike kind of
uh activity couldn't
shake things up I think
young people just take
Greta thunderbergs formula you have
betrayed us
that's all you have to say
captures it all
if you want to destroy all of us admit
what you're doing don't pretend to be
anything else
thinking about the context of the United
States uh
within the within uh Sunrise we've had
kind of contradictory reception of the
inflation reduction act I know it's
better than nothing
but how can we use this to our advantage
you think
um and could this somehow
end up playing to the advantage of
anybody who wants the Green New Deal or
anything beyond that
well well there's only one way to
proceed
that is to expose
and condemn the parts of things like the
inflation reduction act that were gifts
to the fossil fuel industry and which
exposed the way they're using them which
brings out the essence of capitalist
savagery in a dramatic way which I've
really never seen before I mean I don't
have to go through it with you but you
know the idea that say Exxon Mobil can
use the credits
given for decarbonization
to
exploit Fields into Wyoming that are too
carbon heavy for oil
so it can dig into them pull out the
carbon bury it get credits under the
inflation reduction Act then you then
dig for more fossil fuels
um if you ever want to expose the nature
of capitalism
couldn't be more dramatic
um they're giving it to you in a silver
platter so expose that show what it
means
so we have to have deep social change
same time make use of the positive
elements and there were some positive
elements and develop and exploit them
it's a double-edged policy but we know
what has to be done
and I think it's very educational
you can go to people in say look
you want to put your fate in the hands
of people who are going to use the money
we give them in order to dig up more
carbon so they can bury it and get more
money
I mean is that the world you want to
live in
right yeah
of
you've mentioned capitalism now and I
I'm personally relieved I'm sure I'm not
the only one
um I can also foresee even on the left
the left liberal end of things that
um
putting the issue of capitalism on the
table maybe there's no time for it maybe
it's not the right time or even it's not
politically feasible at this time but I
think that the consensus about
um the harms done by capitalism is
something that we can now talk about but
what do you think about moving this
consensus
I don't think it's an either or
you're right it's a fact that the time
skills require that the Practical
measures to overcome the crisis be
undertaken Within
a basically State capitalist framework
the time skill for getting rid of that
is much deeper and longer but that
doesn't mean we have to stop exposing it
you can do it right away and that has
immediate practical consequences we can
say look it's this ridiculous rotten
system of transferring decision making
to the super wealthy that is causing
things like uh not having a
authentic renewed deal but only green
washing so if you wanna
take out practical measures right now
you have to understand the fundamentally
Savage and suicidal nature of the system
let's work on changing them both
I see I see a both and not an either or
I don't remember that
hmm
there are
some things that come to mind when I
think about uh the limitations of the
green New Deal or how people have talked
about the limitations of the great New
Deal uh one of the things that comes up
is the military
and the military's use of fossil fuels
and carbon and everything else and the
other one has to do with uh
environmental destruction of you know
say building uh solar panels you're
going to exploit the by the environment
over here
um and both of these aspects I haven't
found
answers to this question of whether
these elements of the green New Deal can
be sold
right
um well let's take the second
environmental destruction with solar
panels
I just saw
a study of England somewhere
turns out that the land used for golf
courses is about five times the amount
used for solar panels
so if we're worried about destruction of
the environment we could start with golf
courses for Donald Trump and his friends
I mean right where I live in Arizona
there's a serious water shortage
but this golf course is all over the
place being irrigated
Plus
Alfalfa being planted to enrich
agribusiness by selling it to South
Saudi Arabia and using up all the water
in Arizona so people can't have things
to drink I mean everywhere you look you
can see the savagery and absurdity of
the reigning system and what it's doing
to our plans and needs yes
solar panels wind turbines anything
that's going to have a downside there's
no no possibility of anything pure
but it's a question of comparative costs
and benefits
if you're worried about land use which
you should be
get rid of the golf courses
or just take the
I mean the environmental issues outside
of global warming are very serious
just a couple days ago the
a biodiversity convention was signed in
Montreal
200 countries
one country missing
the usual one well I didn't see any
headlines about that but that's worked
for the sunrise movement why is the
United States the only country in the
world that will not sign the
biodiversity convention
which is critical for saving land and
resources
take the military
I mean they just passed the military
budget which is almost a trillion
dollars it's a totally grit disc has
nothing to do with any defensive
purposes way beyond all other countries
put together and it's part of aggressive
actions that are being taken in the Far
East
China
U.S virtually declared war on China a
couple of weeks ago with this Biden plan
to block any advanced technology going
to China first
well
then you that's buttressed by
encircling China with uh
heavily armed ring of States yeah and
let's have a war with China that's uh
the support of the military budget
planning for destruction
devoting resources or just then go back
to Ukraine I mean unless
the longer that work continues the more
Ukraine is going to be destroyed and the
more resources are wasted in destruction
that are desperately needed for dealing
with climate so everywhere you look it's
all interconnected
one of the things that comes to mind
um
is
the the uh say the the finite
capacity that people have to stay
motivated
um I remember personally from Occupy
Wall Street days you know there's this
huge explosion public at brilliant
tactic of public attention and then
everything kind of uh wilts you know
um Sunrise movement of course has the
historic help of AOC right and then
there's this huge lifting of uh
motivation to get involved and to
participate
um and we've dealt with uh pretty severe
moments of discouragement but I'm
wondering if you've seen or know about
movement uh history moments where things
were able to evolve uh into more serious
programs and sustain a long-term
momentum for years for years
yeah I'm old enough to remember the days
when there was a lively Communist Party
in the United States
and most of my family were involved in
it back in the 30s there were a lot of
things wrong with it but there were some
things that were right
they were in it for the Long Haul
they didn't it wasn't a tactics oriented
movement
like occupy occupy was a tactic not a
movement you can't keep it up very long
by its very nature uh Communist party
was
and all the craziness whatever you want
to talk about nevertheless they were in
there for the Long Haul they were going
to be defeats but they were going to
stick around and if you needed somebody
to run the mimeograph machine
it was going to be there
okay that's the kind of movement you
need
socialist movement was like that as well
and the capitalist class understands it
that's why there has been such brutal
and vicious attack against any
moderately left movement
into the first World War uh Woodrow
Wilson
destroyed the Socialist Party totally
destroyed it with violence uh
after the second World War
communist socialists were destroyed with
what's misleadingly called McCarthyism
point was to get the militant activists
out of the unions out of any other part
of life demonize them
turned them into objects of hatred same
right now
of the rosophobia now is beyond anything
I've ever seen and it's used just to
immediately demonize anyone
Henry Kissinger attacked as a Putin
lover because he said maybe we should
have think about peace or something I
mean it's this is a deep
long-standing feature of
the American
social
economic system with a highly class
conscious business class
constantly fighting a vicious class war
never relenting and you just don't get
permanent movements every movement that
comes like Sunrise has the beginning for
begin from scratch
doesn't pick up from a long-lasting
tradition
like say the Communist Party
well that's something same with SDS
grew out of nowhere there was no
background
I had to invent everything for
themselves
uh
that's uh
long-standing feature it's one of the
it's connected with the fact that the
United States is soon
backward in Social and economic issues
I mean you take somebody like Bernie
Sanders
who's considered radical left here
I mean in Europe he'd be Centrist
politician you know calling for
Universal Health Care how radical you
know
and it's it's funny because uh when he
there's a really nice clip of him in
front of a Fox News audience and he asks
them is expecting Universal Health Care
radical and they all say this is a Fox
News audience they all say no
and he uh he he really put his faith in
the common sense of of people to kind of
transcend these ideological barriers
that's right it worked
um instead of the slogans talk about the
idea the policies
Democrats were
had any intention of becoming a popular
party they could have saved the build
back better uh legislation by doing
something they refused to do
go to the people with the individual
programs and say do you want this
program
everybody says yes you want that program
everybody said yes you want build back
better no because that's the government
taking over well you can overcome that
by not accepting the terrain at the
right wing establishes
one of the
um more recent books about climate
change is by a guy named Matt Huber I
believe is how you pronounce it uh
his book is called climate change as
class war
and in Sunrise movement uh class war may
be operating in the background right
amidst uh let's say race and gender
politics alongside it
um I talked to when I talked to uh
Starbucks Workers Union member named
Lynn Harris I told her that I thought it
was peculiar and I think this is part of
the success of that wave that when you
put class Consciousness out front it
seems to get past a lot of these uh more
divisive areas which are nevertheless
important
um and I'm wondering where how you see
uh let's say a class first style of
analysis playing into the climate
Justice movement
I think it's the right movement
that's what happens when you organize
Mine Workers in West Virginia
to say yes we're going to work for a
transition program
we want our lives they can even go on
and say we want to work for a transition
program in which we take over the energy
system not hand it to some rich Bankers
in New York I can do that too
I mean it's worth remembering
Tony mazaki not that long ago
the
it was one of the militants activists in
the uh
oil
Atomic work oil Atomic workers
chemical workers union
and he was a
radical anti-capitalist and a militant
environmentalist
and in fact that Union was right on the
Forefront back in the early 70s of
environmental regulations
now they're the people who see it
firsthand
you're a chemical worker you don't be
told about pollution you know if they
read a book about it you know and
he tried to
organize a labor party
back in the 90s but couldn't get enough
traction but that's the kind of thing
that should be done
uh working people on the front line
ought to be right in the front of the
climate change movement they're the ones
who suffer their Community suffer their
families suffered their children are
going to be wiped down
they can be mobilized to work on it but
on class issues not by asking them what
pronouns he used
appreciate that
do you see prospects for victory in this
very long and unlikely struggle
do you see uh do you see
a light at the end of the tunnel here
this is a very long night
we don't know so we have to assume that
there is
uh
I don't know if you've ever
read the analects
confusion analytes it's interesting
one of my favorite lines in it is uh
they describe
the most honorable
elevated person
the master himself
he's the person who keeps on struggling
even though he knows there is no hope
well we don't have to go quite that far
but
[Music]
there are a million questions here and
I'm trying to pick out some
I think of uh interconnections with
other moments of the left right we
ventured occupy now uh this one comes
from a friend of mine I imagine that he
sees a linkage between the water is life
uh you know Keystone Pipeline struggle
for indigenous rights as connected with
uh the climate movement and I
I wonder how how you can form a coherent
agenda out of all of these different
moving parts and what does it mean to
um
to have a serious program come out of
this all of these out of all of these
differences
take indigenous people
a very striking fact that all over the
world
the indigenous populations are in the
lead in struggling against destruction
of the climate
through first nations in Canada
tribal groups in the United States like
Keystone Pipeline Aboriginal people in
Australia
in Brazil it's the indigenous
populations that are out in the front to
try to save the Amazon
in India tribal people I mean there
way out in the future we're
so-called civilization is way behind
and we had to listen to them at a very
eloquent they're doing things we can
move forward with them
you look at indigenous people young
people
that's where the hope is and
they can perfectly well be talking to
minors in California and saying look
we're all in this together
there isn't going to be any California
if we keep this up
that makes me think of uh
you know there for moments where popular
where a struggle goes popular like with
George Floyd's murder black lives matter
takes off
or Masa amini in Iran right
um there's a social tragedy there's a
travesty that seems to strike at people
it gets to their empathy with each other
they come together very quickly
um
when Jackson Mississippi is flooded and
when New York has Subway stuff been
flooded I kind of wonder why there's not
a similar point where we go stop we need
to come together around this and I'm
wondering uh
does does is there is is it just a
different uh process you think what do
you think is going on there
well I think what you're what you think
about the examples you gave
those are individual events that led to
a tactic
will a movement that's ongoing
uh long term
established goals can make use of
particular moments and tactics but if
that's all the movement is it's going to
die
you can't have a movement based on
tactics
and if you do use tactics you have to
think them through
so take the black lives matter
oh the the slogan that came out of it
right away it was defund the police
well
it's not a bad idea if you think about
it seriously
turn there's plenty of police functions
that should be handed over to Social
Services
and police salaries can be raised so
that they have a decent training and so
on
that's the way Bernie Sanders AOC a
couple others formulated defund the
police
it's not what lasted the right wing took
it over and turned it into the lit
criminals running the streets
well
you go to think about that when you
formulate slogans
the right wing is there ready to pounce
anytime you make a slight mistake and
they're gonna leap on it you have to be
ready for it you want to talk about
defund the police
don't produce that slogan produce the
actual program you're proposing
let's
remove police from work they shouldn't
be doing and that social workers should
be doing as well or better let police
concentrate on police work be better
paid better trained
and if there's a family disputes and
then social workers
if somebody's has an overdose you don't
think they're a lost dog you don't need
the police
I mean I've had that we have
we leave out on the suburbs there's a
you see a dog roaming around that's
obviously lost
what can you do you call the police it's
ridiculous right
any thoughts on d-growth
well what does it mean
I mean if we
if we're going to have solar panels
if we're going to have mass
transportation
they have to be built
so that's growth
uh if you want to get rid of too many
cars on the road that's the growth
I mean you need something you want to
grow in some areas and decline in other
areas
I don't think degrowth itself
is this Logan does it mean we should
stop it trying to get
efficient mass transportation and it's
ridiculous but that takes a lot of
development
so
um you can see the point where there's a
lot of very wasteful over consumption
which has in fact uh you know the
business world devotes hundreds of
billions of dollars a year to try to
elicit useless consumptions
that's what the advertising industry is
about okay that's something that should
be people should be educated about
uh and turned to more useful and more
healthy better things
but
there's going to have to be growth if we
want to get out of the
dangerous climate crisis everybody
agrees Within
[Music]
hang on there's one coming
uh
I appreciate this hang on
when I'm thinking about
uh
International like say for example China
phobia along with russophobia right the
prospect of serious International
cooperation seems like we're getting
further and further from it so is there
a linkage a necessary linkage let's say
between anti-war politics and climate
Justice politics
yeah
let's go back to the 1945 not that long
back long ago
you asked people is there any hope of
France and Germany cooperating
inconceivable
right now they're close allies
uh
yes it's possible not only possible but
necessary
there has to be has to be accommodation
with Russia China
for us to escape our joint problems
none of the major problems we Face have
borders
those are common problems we either work
together on solving them or we'll go
down to destruction together
and it can happen I mean the
Germany France cases a recent example
you go back to 1945 it seemed
inconceivable
when I hear this uh and in fact if you
look back over a longer stretch of
History
uh
I mean
you you can find just how this works
so take the Napoleonic Wars
France was
rampaging all over Europe uh
finally Napoleon was defeated
the
conservative right-wing Statesman
the Tsar medernick
uh organized what was called a concert
of Europe
in which there were no Victors and no
defeated
France was brought in France which had
been destroying the whole continent was
brought in as a common member
it led to about a century of relative
peace
well that statesmanship
happened to be the far right he did it
but we're going to have to have the same
thing now
when I hear the
when I hear what it takes it makes me
think
how does how can local organizing going
door to door in a neighborhood affect an
expectation that that's Global you know
oh you go door to door
and you ask
do you want your tax money to go to new
kinds of uh
missiles that'll destroy us and everyone
else or would you like to have them
a decent health and education system
that's local organizing
do you see that this is kind of a split
hair question
but there's argument as to whether
we want to if we want uh electoral
leadership Do you want to build it from
within the Democratic party even Ralph
Nader I think said recently that uh
serious Progressive representation could
come from within the Democratic party at
this point we have the squad and there's
Barry Sanders of course over here
but then there's uh you know this desire
for this pure ideology or the you know
the a party that could gather resources
and have its own very serious
uncompromising Progressive agenda which
one do you see or is there a possibility
for the latter at all and then uh what
about the former how serious is uh
representation for climate Justice at
this point well I don't we're not going
to have a pure party within the state
capitalist Society you could have a
party that's concerned with the needs
and rights of working people and the
poor you could there's normally a
violent attack against any effort to
create that but you could work for it at
the very same time there's no
contradiction you can support those
elements within the Democratic Party
if it was 50 years ago
you could could have supported those
elements within the Republican Party
I mean I voted for Republicans there's
there was a time when moderate
Republicans and
liberal Democrats were not that
different
when it's only in the last 30 or 40
years that the Republican party has gone
completely off the rails and it's just
in the fascist party
but you could could return and the
Democrats could turn to class issues to
issues they don't have to lose more of
the working class every election they
have the right policies they can win
that back
uh many people who voted for Obama
believing his false promises later
turned to Trump when they were betrayed
not that long ago and that doesn't
change the hope for developing something
like maybe Tony mazaki's worker sporting
labor party
those are not contradictory efforts they
can work and they can support each other
I'm in for the left altogether
I mean the idea there is a Doctrine in
the United States a reigning doctrine
that says politics consists of going to
the polls every couple of years pushing
a button then going home and let the
other guys run things
it's not the left attitude
the left attitude is Publix is politics
is what you do every day
all the time
every once in a while an election comes
along
take off a few minutes vote against the
worst guy and go back to work
that's a very different attitude and a
lot of the left is caught up with the
hysteria a huge amount of debate and
discussion about should we vote should
we not vote I mean
you know if you're sensible you take off
a few minutes and you vote against Trump
and go back to work
but uh
we shouldn't even be talking about it
right do you have any uh thoughts about
I don't quite know as much as I should
about this myself but uh right wing
responses to the environmental crisis or
ego fascism
and how do how do we uh make ourselves
how do we make ourselves as the left
distinct from a right-wing
environmentalism I don't really know
much about right-wing environmentalism
because I know they don't care about the
environment
I don't know much about rifling
environmentalism either I mean if there
is some serious environmentalism in the
right that's great
I'm perfectly happy to work with them if
it's there
eco-fascism I think refers to
uh kind of isolationist policies as a
response to the environmental crisis
uh so you know
what's an isolationist response it means
if uh if water becomes scarce in some
other part of the world let them die
we're going to make ourselves safe here
in America
foreign
you could have that you could say I
don't care about anything but me and my
friends okay let's kill everybody else I
don't see any point in talking about
this sure there are people who maybe
there are some who are
so beyond the level of
or of human nature that if they see a
child in the street starving and he has
a piece of bread and you want the bread
you just take it from it I presume there
are such people but that's pathology
do you have any thoughts about the role
of media conditioning or the manufacture
of consent in regards to the climate
crisis
well
yeah
[Laughter]
they should be telling us the truth
they should be telling us clearly
uh
I mean the things that I just mentioned
like for example about Exxon Mobil and
the decarbonization you could find that
in the media
but it shouldn't be buried somewhere
should be the headline that's what you
should be telling people all along the
there is a self-destructive social
system based on private
based on the principle that you
mentioned
the hell with everyone else actually
it's not novel Adam Smith wrote about it
Adam Smith wrote that in all ages
the masters of the economy follow their
vile Maxim all for ourselves nothing for
anyone else
okay put that in the headline every day
give examples of it say here's what we
have to do to overcome it now that's
dealing with the climate crisis
I feel uh I feel that this has been a
satisfactory dialogue myself
do you have any additional words here
yeah to work we don't have a lot of time
we know what has to be done
all the problems we face do have answers
but they're not going to solve
themselves
it's going to take a lot of hard and
dedicated work a realistic
view of the way the world works
and then a willingness to dedicate
ourselves to work within it where we can
to change it where we can
do you have time for a Linguistics
question and then I'll let you go okay
it's good to see you now and of course
thank you
uh a while ago you sent me a paper I
think I was I I asked you something and
I said I've been organizing for Sunrise
I've done everything I'm supposed to and
I really want to do something fun and
you sent me back this paper uh which had
to do with universal grammar and its
relationship to click languages do you
remember this or do you know the
research that I'm talking about oh yeah
uh well I couldn't make head or tails
but can you talk a little bit about the
research paper he's a very smart guy one
of the best
thing with some of the best people all
together in the world Renee hoiberx an
old friend
but what he
basically showed was that
um it's known
there's no genomic evidence
showing that
there was there was there was a very
small number of humans in the early
stages of a human existence on earth a
couple hundred thousand years ago but
they began to separate this is in Africa
and the earliest separation was What's
called the sun people
uh they speak
they have the same cognitive capacity
same language faculty we have so it was
all in place but their languages are
somewhat different
they turn out to be the only languages
that make extensive use of what are
called clicks
I can't make them but in the various
kinds of things like that which fit into
the language in complex ways
and
apparently they I'm in the hoiberg's
thesis is that when they separated the
mode of externalizing the internal
language is the same but the mode of
externalizing it went in a slightly
different direction
so they end up
a couple hundred thousand years later
with click languages which aren't found
elsewhere
now he gives a lot of Ms complicated
business but that's why the paper was
complicated but but it affirms Universal
grammar
that the the underlying grammatical
structure still still conforms to those
of other languages
it seems like they have the same
internal structure but different ways of
uh externalizing it it's not anything
very obscure you have a laptop computer
it has a calculating program in it for
multiplying you can hook it up to
different printers
the program's the same it's just the
printers different
that seems to be the way language works
internal system is pretty much the same
can hook it up to different ways of
externalizing it
right no it's been a fun hour it's been
a dream come true for me and it's good
to see you again
good to talk to you any plans for the
New Year
more of the same
look forward to it
I'll see you again
thanks
