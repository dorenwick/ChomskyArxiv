quickly my first question professor
chomsky
liberals and progressives in pakistan
tend to see the taliban as a pakistani
proxy force with no social base or roots
or legitimacy in the country akin to the
american contra proxies in nicaragua do
you share such an assessment or do you
think a little more nuance is required
well like it or not
the taliban have a
fairly solid base in the community
they could not have taken over without
that
in fact they've extended their base
one of the
few surprises
in my view in the
last several months
was how the taliban
quickly expanded their support
from their
traditional
pashtun base
to a much more
multi-ethnic
at least tolerance if not acceptance
the collapse of the
former of the warlords who
from other who based in other ethnic
groups
uh
except for the hazara
they mostly uh
that was
pretty much a surprise i don't think
anyone
at least i didn't anticipate that
uh whether this is support or tolerance
is another question
but that they have
a base in the
rural community is
hard to deny
i mean after all when the
taliban decided
to disappear
after the u.s invasion
they mostly went back to their villages
well what does that mean
then
as the
and in fact it seems that at first there
was
some hope
that the american invasion might lead to
some sort of
development improvement in the
economic and social system
as soon as it turned out that the
american troops were just
fortifying the old warlords
and relying on them
to carry out their own
violent
efforts at domination and control
and we're smashing into houses and
midnight to arrest somebody and throw
them into a torture chamber
bombing uh
wedding parties and so on of course
taliban started emerging again all of
that as a taliban generating system
went on for has been well described by
anand gopal other few other journalists
who were very close on the scene all the
time
american intelligence surely knew it
well then the taliban emerged gradually
expanded their base
when
trump told them
take over anything you like all they had
to do was
wait their time
get ready when the time came
yes they took over
as i say the surprising part
to me at least was the expansion of
their base
to the other
the tajik
uzbek
areas
the areas around the hebrat also a bit
of a surprise but
and again
to what extent this is support
to what a sense it's
simply tolerance of what exists
is very hard to determine
but i don't see how one can question
that they are
in effect the governing authority at
this point
right thank you professor chomsky
