>> Sonali Kolhatkar: Noam Chomsky helps us
answer the big question,
why does the United States seem
driven to create an empire?
Welcome to the Henry A.
Wallace National Security Forum.
I'm Sonali Kolhatkar.
Many Americans are not
accustomed to the idea
that our country sits at the
top of the global empire.
But with military bases
in dozens of countries,
interventions in other
country's political processes,
and all-out invasions,
there's no other word
to describe our projectory.
But why are we so prone
to empire building?
Joining me to answer that
question is renowned author,
linguist, and political
commentator,
Professor Noam Chomsky,
welcome to the program!
>> Professor Noam Chomsky:
Glad to be with you.
>> Sonali Kolhatkar: Where do
you think the U.S.'s aspirations
for empire come from?
Is it the nature of any state
to pursue military domination
or do you think there's
something specific
to U.S. history that this
country is particularly prone
to imperialism because of?
>> Professor Noam Chomsky: A
good explanation of it was given
by John Lewis Gaddis, expansion
is the path to security.
If you want to be secure, you
have to control everything else.
The commitment empire goes back
to the original colonization.
By the Second World War, the
United States was in a position
of unprecedented power.
The end of the Second World War,
the U.S. literally had
half the world's wealth.
The tacit assumption
was we own the world.
You can see this very clearly
in what happened as soon
as this system of
power began to erode,
and that happened
very quickly in 1949.
China became independent.
There's a name for that in
American and political history.
It's called the Loss of China.
The phrase Loss of China
expresses the tacit assumption
that basically we own
China and if it moves
to independence, we've lost it.
And since we own most of
the world in this sense,
we have to defend it, so we have
to have a thousand military
bases, military forces,
almost as great as the
rest of the world combined,
and it runs right
through American history.
This fear of everything
is pervasive,
goes back to the
origins of the society.
It's relate to the empirical
thrust of, as Gaddis put it,
attaining security
through expansion.
And that's limitless
essentially.
So that's the empirical thrusts,
not unique to the United States,
it's developed in an
extreme form here,
but that's because of
extraordinary U.S. wealth
and power.
>> Sonali Kolhatkar: How
intertwined is corporatism
and the drive for profit
with our militaries?
And is it always the case
that, that the drive for access
to resources tends to
drive our militarism?
>> Professor Noam
Chomsky: Well, if you look,
take a look through history
again, in the 19th century,
the major commodity,
the equivalent
of oil today was cotton.
Now that was the source of
the Industrial Revolution.
Jacksonian presidents of the
mid 19th century explained very
clearly that there, they
wanted to conquer Texas
and a large part of
Mexico, approximately half,
in order to try to gain
a monopoly over cotton.
President Polk said,
[inaudible] said
that that would bring England to
our feet by gaining a monopoly
of the major commodity
in the world, cotton.
Move on a few years, oil becomes
the major commodity, and,
incidentally, it's not a matter
of, primarily of access to oil.
During the whole period when
the U.S. was the major producer
and didn't need access to the
oil, its policies were the same.
The issue was control
over oil, not access.
And there was a reason for that.
And when the U.S.
invaded Iraq in 2003,
speaking of [inaudible], that
if it works, it'll be very good
because controlling Iraqi oil
and increasing our control
over Middle East oil will give
us what he called critical
leverage over Europe and other
industrial powers, and we'll be
in a position to
hold the spigot.
I've just talked about two
of the major commodities.
You look at others and it's, you
get pretty much the same story.
>> Sonali Kolhatkar: Now you've
written about mass media,
and how it is, you know, often
used to manufacture consent
from the U.S. public
for things like war
and strengthening U.S. empire,
but today we have a
significantly changed media
landscape, at least it seems so,
and I'm wondering if you feel
that we, as citizens,
are still prone to the,
the kind of brainwashing
that we once were?
>> Professor Noam
Chomsky: People are deluged
with a single message.
We're defending ourselves.
So, take a look at the, the
invasion of Iraq, let's say.
Barack Obama is considered a
critic, but notice his grounds.
Not that aggression is wrong.
Not that destruction of a
society by violence is wrong.
It's that it was a
blunder, so that implies
that if the aggression and
violence had succeeded,
expanding our control over the,
the, one of the major resources,
the contemporary world,
giving us critical leverage
over our rivals, than it
wouldn't have been stupid,
it would have been fine.
That's called criticism, the
worst criticism that can be made
within the mainstream of U.S.
policy is it was a mistake.
These are the standard views
of what are called statesmen,
people who are committed
to defending
and expanding powerful
interests, powerful, dominant,
domestic interests, and that
leads to the thrust for empire,
and the justification of
that thrust, as defensive.
Now going back to the
population, it is submerged
in doctrinal pronouncements
of this kind.
When enemies do it,
we call it propaganda.
But when we do it,
we call it education,
but it's not very different.
But an isolated individual,
faced with this deluge
of propaganda, of
doctrinal uniformity,
does have a difficult
time extricating himself
or herself from it.
>> Sonali Kolhatkar:
Finally Professor Chomsky,
many have predicted that the
U.S. empire may be waning,
that we're in this sort of
twilight of empire phase.
Do you have any sense that
that might actually be true?
>> Professor Noam Chomsky:
There has certainly been decline
from the high point of
power, which was 1945.
But as I mentioned, that
decline began right away.
1949, a large part of
the empire was lost.
There was immediate concern that
Southeast Asia might be lost,
that's the origins of the
Vietnam War, there was concerns
over Latin America,
the Middle East.
In the last decade,
South America has become,
has gained substantial
independence,
and by now they're very
free from U.S. domination.
It's an enormous change.
That's the loss of South
America, if you like it.
So sure, the process of
decline goes on, continues,
waxes and wanes, it's
not a steady process,
but there is a tendency for
power to become more diffused,
but the United States is still
overwhelming in many dimensions.
Crucially in the dimension of
violence, the U.S. is far ahead
of anyone else in military
bases, military technology,
far more advanced than anywhere,
and even simple military
spending, as I said,
it's almost as much as the
rest of the world combined.
So empire is a complex affair.
Yes, there's a decline, began
in the 1940's, its continuing,
but has, by no means, abated.
>> Sonali Kolhatkar:
Professor Chomsky,
thank you so much
for joining us.

On the next episode
of the Henry A. Wallace
National Security Forum,
we'll talk to activist and
author, Roxanne Dunbar -Ortiz,
about how the U.S.
uses its experience
of occupying indigenous
people's lands in its efforts
to dominate other
countries overseas.
>> Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: So
the imperialist urge was there
from the beginning and it got
institutionalized, it's the,
it's the core makeup
of the U.S. Army today,
and in almost every situation.
