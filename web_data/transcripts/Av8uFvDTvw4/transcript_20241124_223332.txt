[Music]
um the first question was having spoken
about the Russian threat and the Cold
War um what kind of relationship do you
think CH uh Russia seeks um the US seeks
with China in the future so I imagine
this being also very important um the
future power of China um the second
question was
the United States is
uh try this one can you hear now yeah
well if you take a look at what's
happening
now
uh take a look at this morning's
newspaper The Washington Post the main
newspaper that deals with Washington
Affairs there's a report uh of the U US
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hegel who
finally concedes that uh Putin is
withdrawing forces from the border of
Ukraine but he says and Washington
backed him up that this is not enough
now they have to withdraw all the forces
and we cannot Overlook the fact that
they already placed forces there that's
permanent notice that the issue is not
whether Putin is withdrawing forces from
Mexico and Canada I mean if Russian
forces were in Mexico Canada we wouldn't
be here to talk about it there'd be a
nuclear war tomorrow if not yesterday
but he's withdrawing forces from within
Russia from the borders of Ukraine which
the US and the West have been trying
hard to assimilate into the Western
economic and Military system on the
borders of Russia and that's considered
perfectly legitimate it's Putin's fault
not ours but what's happening is that uh
this is driving the Russians consciously
towards a closer alliance with
China uh how can they possibly react and
there are natural relations between
China and Russia China Russia Siberia
Eastern Russia has huge resources China
needs them there's all sorts of
historical antagonisms they've been
practically a war for many years but
yeah it's driving them towards a closer
Alliance and it's um tending to reshape
U world affairs in that manner actually
this is happening on China's uh eastern
border Maritime border as well uh China
is being pretty much barred from uh its
own the waters off China's Shore China
wants to exert uh influence over them
and there's a conflict about that notice
the conflict is not about the waters off
California or the Caribbean that's not
an issue the US controls everything uh
the question is the waters off the coast
of China and because of recognizing
those difficulties China is moving
towards Central Asia to establishing
close relations with many of the Central
Asian States uh interesting relations
for now by now you can actually take a
high-speed train from China to
Kazakhstan you can't take one from
Boston to New York uh but uh and but
it's true that these pressures are
driving China towards Central Asia are
driving Russia towards China China has
established some years ago the Shanghai
cooperation
organization which is
includes China
India uh Pakistan Kazakhstan other
Central Asian countries uh the US
requested permission to be an observer
that was refused Iran requested and is
accepted it is an observer and this
system is gradually developing
and will become a
significant system in world affairs but
we're quite consciously pressing them in
that
direction it comes from a premise the
premise is we own the world and if
anybody else is doing anything it's
there there something wrong with
them
okay hi um I was reading uh what you
wrote about the influence of corporate
America uh in Germany during the 30s and
with the government behind even this
statement from the state department
supporting Hitler and
fascism and um I would like to hear
about that and if you know about anony
saton I was reading about from him long
ago he made a very
detailed um research about the
relationship between the
corporations and Fascist governments he
has a crazy theories about global
communism so I am confused because the
corporate analysis is quite interesting
he take documents from hubber
institution and he was supposed to be in
contact to so
that's us relations with Nazi Germany
during the 30s yes yeah well there's
plenty of evidence about that as far as
the business world is concerned sure why
not major US corporations IBM Ford were
had factories installations in Germany
it's actually continued right through
the war under various gues you know they
set up fake corporations and they were
participating actively but that's uh
corporations aimed to make money and to
expand power and they had no real
objections to Nazism in fact uh looked
at it rather positively the were doing
the right thing they were crushing the
labor movement they were eliminating
dissident of course destroying the huge
communist and Social Democratic parties
what's to object uh as far as the US
government was concerned it was kind of
ambivalent uh the state department was
quite
prazi uh
1937 uh the state department urged that
U the United States take a tolerant
attitude towards Hitler because Hitler
they describ described him as a moderate
standing between the forces of the
extremists of left and right and
therefore we should support him in the
hopes of a more moderate Germany
emerging uh after
Munich you know the Munich agreement
late 38 uh Roosevelt sent his most
trusted advisor suar Wells to the Munich
agreement you take a look at what he
reported on the way back he reported
that now we're on the way to a new era
of peace with the moderate Hitler who's
accommodating uh you know wants the same
things we do we should look forward to
it it goes on that take George Kennan
one of the great States you know the
most revered Statesmen of the 20th
century one of the framers of the modern
world he was the consul the US cons
in Berlin in those years he stayed until
Pearl Harbor till Germany declared war
he was in Berlin uh September
1941 he was writing back dispatches from
Berlin this is after the war had started
you know saying that uh we shouldn't be
too harsh about Germany they're pursuing
their national interests in a reasonable
way and uh we should cooperate with them
that and the British were even more
extreme they had very close relations
with economic and political relations
with Germany I mean in retrospect this
is called a appeasement it's supposed to
be a bad thing but that's retrospect at
the time if you look that was not the
general attitude and in fact the support
for molini was even more extreme there
was actually a love affair with molini
literally uh Roosevelt described him as
that admirable Italian gentleman who was
uh pursuing the right course until sort
of at the end of the 30s he sort of got
misled by Hitler and things weren't so
good but he was basically a good person
and uh some of the commentary was just
when you look back at it it's hard to
believe so in
1932 that's 10 years after musolini had
destroyed Italian democracy smashed the
labor movement he was attacking Ethiopia
the leading business magazine azine in
the United States Fortune Magazine had a
cover story on Italy's progress and how
wonderful it was under
molini and the
title have to know American slang to
understand it I'll explain it the title
was uh the wops are un whopping
themselves WAP is a term like or
 or something like that it's a
derogatory term for Italians so the wops
were un whopping themselves they were no
longer like these degenerate Italians
under musolini that's the leading
business magazine and this goes right
through the
30s and you said something very
important about stopping the war they
could have stop the war
okay so thank
you Mr chumsky it was a um it was a
great speech and you have only only
small question uh concerning a
international appeal which you signed
about 3 years ago uh that all
universities should reject military
research worldwide a big Vision a big
Vision uh but if one repeat Visions uh
then they can be come true uh this in
this in this city there is a a um a
research institute
kit uh sounds uh similar as MIT where
you come and you know what
militarization there is uh this kit is
doing military research and if you would
repeat your appeal on the K kit
Administration that could be a a good
point uh for all of us and for peaceful
sence
[Applause]
[Music]
I have to say I sign appeals all the
time I just signed one outside the door
in fact and I can barely remember them I
just don't remember this one but let me
talk about
MIT uh military research is a very
interesting phenomenon MIT where I've
been since
1955 is the leading technolog olcal
scientific institution in the world uh
for years up until the
1970s was almost entirely funded by the
Pentagon okay like I was working in a
lab which was 100% funded by the three
armed services if you take a look at my
Publications in the 50s and the 60s they
have an acknowledgement to the armed
services in the late 60s as student
activism finally developed there were
there were protests against military
funding and a commission was set up
usual thing to investigate military
funding at MIT I was on it students
wanted somebody on it who would be
sympathetic to them so I was put on it
and the results are published it's a
very it was very interesting to
investigate it turned out that maybe 90%
of the academic budget forget something
like that was funded by the Pentagon and
it turned out that that the only one
department at MIT was carrying out any
military research guess which one the
political science
department the political science
department had something called a peace
Research Institute that's a dead
giveaway the peace Research Institute
was involved in counterinsurgency work
in Vietnam that they were sending
students to Vietnam to do their
dissertations on how to pacify you know
you know what that means the peasants of
South Vietnam you know were being
massacred that was the only
department now what does that mean well
military research is a device for
compelling the population to fund the
profits of high-tech
industry that's one of its major
function
so you take a look at say computers the
Internet lasers
microelectronics
satellites run through the whole gamut
where' they come from they come mostly
funded by the Pentagon at institutions
like
MIT taxpayers pay for it because the
Russians are coming so we have to pay
for it and the end result is uh you know
Bill Gates is the richest man in the
world Steve Jobs could set up Apple the
first
computers that reached the
market were 19 1977 Apple that's about
30 year after 30 years of development
mostly in the state sector that's where
the risky costly work is done uh
internet was in the state sector also
for about 30 years before it's handed
over to private Enterprise
uh and in fact if you look at MIT
funding in the ' 50s and the 60s into
the' 70s was mostly the Pentagon that's
declining and what's increasing is
funding from the National Institute of
Health and other health related
institutions and I think everyone
understands this except the economists
who can't understand it because they're
working on abstract models of free
markets which have almost nothing to do
with what's going on but what the reason
for that is that in the 50s and the 60s
The Cutting Edge of the economy was
Electronics based and a good cover for
public spending there to create the
economy of the future is the Pentagon
increasingly The Cutting Edge of the
economy is biology based so now the
taxpayer pays in different ways if you
looked around MIT and other research
institutions MIT others are like this in
the ' 50s and the 60s you saw electronic
firms rathon itch you know big
electronic firms walk around MIT today
you see nardis other pharmaceutical
corporations ripping off stealing the
technology that's being developed in the
state sector and using it for the
profits of the future that's the way the
economy works
uh is a very you know if you read the
newspapers Financial Times the German
economic newspapers they're constantly
talking about free enterprise and
markets and so on I mean there's some
crucial facts about markets you can like
them or not but there are some
properties that they have one property
is that say if you invest in a risky
Enterprise and you invest for decade
after decade uh and uh risk risky and
costly and if after all of this there's
some profit supposed to go back to you
that's not the way the economy works the
taxpayer is extorted essentially to pay
for the risky and costly developments
literally for decades and doesn't get a
penny back for it the profits go to
private
Enterprise that's our free enter rise
economy and uh the
uh and the Pentagon was a
funnel but the but you're right about
military research that shouldn't be on
campus actually I don't think this
should be there either but for different
reasons it's an attack on democracy and
freedom that's no that's true whether
it's the health institutes or the
Pentagon whatever the device is people
are not making the
decisions back in the
1950s if the population had been asked
would you like your taxes to go to
IBM future corporations like Microsoft
so that maybe your great-grandson can
have a smartphone or would you like your
taxes to go to Education Health
infrastructure decent society and so on
people might made a different decision I
think they would have that's why they
weren't asked that's why have to keep
the population in the dark because
they're not allowed to make decisions
like
that um Hello thank you Mr shumsky my
question is how uh we we could solve or
bring up a um more More protest here in
Europe because now we have a big problem
of rightwing uh
movements everywhere also here in
Germany and uh lives of media are still
there they they uh bring them more up
and uh if I see the the politic of the
evf and also the TOA here um what they
uh yeah the the the the measur ism of
austerity they are installed in
Ukraine uh what's yeah what could be the
right way to of your knowledge and your
knowledge um to to bring or take the the
society no to had to to uh fight or make
a nonviolent fight against this
fascistic regime yeah and also the this
functional fascism here in
uh Europe and Germany I would invite you
from the anarchistic and communistic
block of the Occupy blockupy protesters
in Frankfurt to
the opening of the new is ITB in
Frankfurt in Autumn thank
you
thanks well I mean I I think we should
take a lesson from the uh uh the uh
powerful and the rich they understand
this perfectly well that's why the
population has to be kept in the dark
actually the professor of the science of
government I love that term at Harvard
leading policy intellectual Samuel
Huntington once pointed out that power
must remain in the dark exposed to the
sunlight it begins to
evaporate and he's right that's uh what
lies behind the kind of things I was
talking about you know much more about
it here so one thing you can do is to sh
expose power to the the sunlight and it
will evaporate that's why it's the
massive secrecy has to be
maintained uh but that's not enough
exposing power to the sunlight has to be
a preliminary to the only thing that has
ever worked in history Mass popular
organization and that has achieved
results it has plenty of results I mean
right now the uh
troa is trying to dismantle and Destroy
Europe's great post-war achievement the
Social Democratic welfare state and
they're pretty Frank about it Mario
dragi the head of the central bank said
a couple of years ago that the social
the social contract is dead it can't be
maintained why not for economic reasons
just because they have the power to
dismantle and destroy it well it doesn't
have to happen
the power is actually in the hands of
people like you but it's got to be
exercised uh and that requires
organization and action as an individual
you can do very little but when you get
together you can do almost anything and
that's been demonstrated over and over
again through history I mean you
mentioned occupy which is interesting
and important I mean I if I had been
asked myself say should U people should
occupies zucati Park in New York my
judgment would have been it's it's
pointless I was completely wrong it was
very successful remarkably successful
within days weeks there were hundreds of
occupy movements around the country
others in Europe I actually spoke at an
occupi event in Sydney Australia they
were all over the place it lit a spark
which had a real impact and it changed a
lot of things changed the discourse put
inequality on the agenda for the first
time and now phrases like you know 1%
99% just common coin and it's it's but
remember that occupi was a
tactic tactics it wasn't a movement it's
a tactic that has every tactic has
diminishing returns can't keep doing it
over and over and this one in particular
couldn't be continued um you cannot
occupy a Central Square say in New York
or Boston over the winter it's just
impossible you're sitting under 5 ft of
snow you know but and the population
won't accept it after a time so it has
to turn into a movement and to some
extent it has but I think that's the
answer to your question there's no magic
tricks that's the one that's worked all
through history It's Made Real
achievements it there's always
regression Power Systems don't say thank
you we're going to give you the power
they try to maintain themselves and uh
that's a Str that's class struggle goes
on through history and it will
continue hello Mr
triski yeah my my name is ibram and I am
student at the faculty of linguistic in
Italy and I want to ask you about um EUR
Europe
opinion um about the situation the
political situation in Egypt and about
the the last elections for the president
and uh what could what could be the the
right way for the Egyptian to change
this situation thank you
so you're asking about the current
situation in
Egypt well the uh you know the Arab
Spring which took off in Tunisia and
Egypt and then spread was a very
exciting development and uh what the
what happened
is it's a mixed Story I mean I think
it's kind of
in a waiting period right now what
happened in Egypt it Egypt the the first
country where it began was Tunisia
Tunisia is kind of a French protectorate
and the
French of course supported the dictator
Ben Ali in fact supported Ben Ali to the
point where it really became an
embarrassment uh when uh the population
had actually driven Ben Ali out of the
country the French minister one of the
French ministers went to Tunisia for a
vacation you may remember that uh in
Egypt it's mostly a British us
dependency so they took the lead in
responding and they responded exactly
the way you always respond there's a if
you're going into the Diplomatic service
you should understand this there's a
there's a formula for reacting when your
favorite dictator gets into trouble the
first what you do is support him as long
as possible that when it becomes
impossible because the business classes
have turned against him or the Army's
turned against him what you do is send
him off
somewhere uh issue ringing speeches
about your love of democracy and try to
restore the original situation as much
as possible and that's exactly what was
done in Egypt uh there was an there were
quite interesting developments that took
place U and I think they're lasting uh
the labor movement Egypt has very
militant labor movement this long
history of Labor activism which always
crushed under the dictatorship but it
was kind of liberated by this Uprising
and it remains very active the strikes
worker occupation of Industries and so
on that's continuing they couldn't crush
it but there was there was an
election uh the left and the secular
forces were so busy fighting each other
that they could not take an active part
and by default the Muslim Brotherhood
won the
election uh well they the military
retained control they essentially stayed
in power you know under the morsy
government finally they you know Tom
movement came June 30th now Egypt is
moving I think into a very dark period
uh the a lot of I mean I had big
arguments with my friends in Egypt about
this on the left and the secular sectors
they supported the military takeover
believing that the military would
Institute democracy and freedom I mean
you know that's such an illusion you I
don't know how to describe it that's not
what the military does you know what
they want to do is maintain their huge
economic Empire and maintain their power
and control the population and now
that's exactly what they're doing so the
April 6 movement you know the leaders
are in jail repression they're killing
thousands of people it's it's a dark
period but I don't think it's over the
military government can't possibly deal
with the problems that led to the
uprising they go way back to the
neoliberal policies and all sorts of
things and there's plenty of ferment and
I suppose it'll blow up again uh but
this time I hope with more
sophistication I was in Egypt and I
right in the middle of this and I talked
to people like H zahi just the opposing
candidate others who who were activists
and the what they call you know the left
and the secular movements and they
simply couldn't get together if they had
gotten together they would have actually
won the presidential election and
they've got to overcome that uh maybe
they can but I think there's a lot of
promise there still it's a dark period
what happened in the rest of the Arab
world was just the uprises were mostly
crushed by force like in Saudi Arabia
which is the leading us Ally like
Britain before it the US
has systematically supported a radical
Islam Islam against secular nationalism
they much prefer radical Islam to
independ secular nationalism so Saudi
Arabia is the darling most extreme
radical Islamic State in the world uh
and uh there there were efforts at
Friday afternoon protests they were
crushed instantly by force so much so
that people were afraid to get out in
the streets in Riyad Bahrain you know
suis sent military force to crush it the
Emirates mostly crushed crushed in
Libya uh well you know the story in
Libya there was a UN resolution which
called for ceasefire and
negotiations the Western Powers Britain
France and the United States immediately
violated it by becoming the air force of
the U anti- Kadafi resistance and the
result was to turn Libya into just the
monstrosity it's a run by competing
militias I mean it's whether it can be
put back together who knows and
meanwhile the effect of the attack on
Libya has spread right through North
Africa and into the Levant Libyan arms
are all over the place Jihadi group
spreading all over Obama's speech the
other day was about the threat of the
expansion of what he calls Al-Qaeda
don't that's a name doesn't mean
anything for the various
radical Islamic Jihadi groups that are
growing up largely as a result of
Western actions yeah they're spreading
it all over Libya was a case in for well
you know it's the so far the Arab Spring
is a kind of a mixed story uh hasn't had
the achievements that a lot of us hoped
for has some but I think it broke a kind
of a log Jam in the Arab world and
probably it'll go on from there but how
how it proceeds depends on how Egyptians
and others are able to handle the
situation that they face now the West is
certainly going to try to prevent uh
independent
developments but they may not succeed
and there's one striking case in the
last decade that you should pay close
attention to that's South America for
500 years since the
Conquistadors South Amer America has
been controlled by the Imperial Powers
last century and a half the United
States now South America has become the
most free and liberated part of the
world uh in the Western Hemisphere the
United States and Canada are isolated
take a look at the hemispheric
conferences US and Canada are alone
against the rest of Latin America uh
there was a dramatic illustration of
this recently maybe you saw at the a sh
open Society Forum did a study of
rendition rendition is one of the most
extreme forms of barbaric torture that
humans have developed if the United
States wants people to be tortured uh
what they do is send them to countries
run by people like Gaddafi or Assad or
Mubarak or other nice guys send them
there so they can be tortured there and
then we can say well we didn't have
anything to do with it and uh and then
you get whatever you get out of that
well there were countries that
participated in
rendition most of Europe for example
most of Europe was participating a
rendition by uh cooperating with the
United States and sending people to
their favorite Middle East dictatorships
to be tortured in fact most of the world
participated one region of the world
refused to participate Latin America
which is
amazing first of all Latin America has
been almost total Us control you know
for over a century and during this
period Latin America was the world
center of
torture as long as the US was running it
now Latin America was the one region
which refused to participate in US
administered massive torture well that's
the kind of thing that could happen and
it could happen in the Middle
East hello hello can you hear me yeah
yeah um Norm uh I should say that I've
been uh wanting to pisze with you for a
long time and I'm very happy to have the
opportunity um my uh concern is with
your theory is that it besides the fact
that you're immensely informed you're
primarily informed about what has
already happened and the uh conclusions
that you draw are based on your
observations of what has happened in the
world so
far I think that the
um the important thing that we need to
think about is what motivates the human
being to do what it
does and I think when you talk about
forces such as your mentioned of various
kinds you have to think of what the
Instinct that is behind them and my
feeling is that the Instinct of the
human being in the capitalist era in
which we live and have been living since
the invention of
agriculture is that he loves to
belong and I think that our major
Instinct as human beings is the need to
be part of something that's bigger than
we are and I think that the uh the
answer to the uh Arab Spring or the
answer to what's happened with Russia or
what's happening in Ukraine is that
people are afraid of being left alone
with their wonderful ideas somewhere on
an
island my feeling about what you said is
that is not sufficiently oriented
towards what might happen in the future
the more people there are the more they
will be dependent on belonging
I don't think I'm disagreeing as I said
before as as individuals there's very
little that we can do to confront the
enormous problems that we face but when
people get together and organize and
form mass movements they can do a great
deal why not then they belong to
something they belong to Something in
the past what they've never done it in
the past it's happened all the time in
the past all for for thousands of years
that's how feudalism was overthrown
that's how slavery was eliminated in
more recent years that's how women began
to get minimal right you know equ
relatively equal rights it's just case
after case what happened to the
frol French Revolution carried things
forward and then there was a regression
very common uh the uh the activism of
the 1960s be more recent uh civilized
the West considerably many ways but
there was a regression that's what
happens Power Systems do not give up
willingly they'll fight back there have
been
progress uh they'll fight back we can
then go on from a higher plane that's
what history is like the capitalism they
will always
win only if you let them win if if if
you let them win
first of all first of all we should
recognize that what exists isn't
remotely like capitalism I mean I gave a
couple of examples but could go on there
is a system of State corporate power uh
but it's not immutable lots of ways to
overcome it and remove it and some of
them are being
pursued effectively right now so for
example um take the United States place
I know best the old Rust Belt the
industrial
region which has declined seriously
because of a decision to undermine
manufacturing and to crush the workforce
there is a reaction the reaction is the
spread of worker-owned
Enterprises which are proliferating
throughout this region now that can
expand and if there's enough popular
engagement it could expand dramatically
so for example a couple of years ago uh
Obama essentially nationalized most of
the Auto industry okay well if there had
been an organized popular
movement there were several choices he
could he could have made one of them the
one that was made was to essentially
hand it back to pretty much the same
owners and go ahead doing exactly what
they were doing before producing cars
another thing that could have been done
is handed over to the workforce let them
own and direct it and let them produce
the things that the country really needs
for example High-Speed Rail what I said
about China and Boston is like a scandal
uh that could have been done and with
enough popular organization and activism
it would have been done but you can't
blame the lack of that on some human
instinct you can only blame it on the
failure of people like us to do what we
should have been doing and if you do it
you can have these effects as has always
happened in the past but sometimes the
effects are dramatic but take say the
women's movement okay that's half the
world's population if you take a look at
American history it's not that different
elsewhere but if you go back to the
American Revolution uh the colonies took
over British law naturally according to
British law women were not persons they
were property a woman was the pro
legally a woman is the property of her
father and the property's handed over to
the husband one of the arguments against
allowing women to vote was that it would
be unfair to unmarried men because a
married man would have two votes since
obviously the property votes the way its
owner does uh over the years this that
was chipping away at this but it wasn't
really until the 1960s that it almost
totally collapsed in fact in
1975 which is not that long ago the
Supreme Court recognized that women are
what are legally called peers they are
legally permitted to serve in federal
juries okay that means they're persons
that's a big change I mean an audience
like this wouldn't look like this years
ago U when I came to MIT
1950s it w it was white
males uh obedient well-dressed
differential and so on he walk down the
Halls today it's half women third
minorities informal relations which
means a lot uh activism all over the
place and that's happened all over the
world it's happened in Germany I've seen
it when I come give talks over the years
just looks different each time well
those are big changes major changes and
they didn't come by uh wishing for it
they came by organized activist efforts
which were hard met a lot of resistance
but won a lot of games and it can be
done in many other ways too
[Applause]
thanks a lot um I really loved your so
radical and well-informed View and my
also very much in favor of these
emphasis on uh grassroot politics which
really are the basis of of any change my
question is you may know um when Obama
won the first election whole Europe
especially Germany was totally in favor
of him I think there were about 90% of
the population in favor of that this has
changed as you know and so people ask
and also I myself ask myself why did he
never close Guantanamo why he did he
didn't he stop uh Kuba boycott why
didn't didn't he restrict
NSA activities and so forth has it
simply to do with the fact that he is
not able to do it that he doesn't have
the power to do it or is it Al or also
did we have a wrong impression of his
real attitude well all I can say is that
uh in in
2008 before the
primaries I wrote about Obama no nothing
much was known about him he had no
record but I just took a look at his
record and his presentations of himself
on his own website and it was obvious
that this person has no
principles uh there's he's there nothing
but rhetoric you know I mean for example
uh you take a look on his website 2008
before the primaries so for example take
a look at his when he was a Senator he
had almost no record but he did do a few
things and he was very proud of them and
one of the things he emphasized on his
website was that in the year 2006
when Israel invaded Lebanon for the
fifth time practically destroyed half of
it uh Obama sponsored a resolution in
the Senate uh in uh in to demanding that
the US government permit Israel to
continue the attack until it achieves
its objectives and to punish anyone
hasbalah Syria Iran which tries to
impede Israel in its destruction of
Lebanon destroying half the so than half
the country again as they've done
repeatedly killing killed over a
thousand people that was the achievement
that he was most proud of in the
Senate and it goes on like that the rest
of it was empty
rhetoric hope change I'm a nice guy you
know so on and so forth to try to find
something else there was no reason to be
disillusioned because there was no
reason for the Illusions in the first
place and uh when you look you can see
it you know and uh it it's true but it's
true that people are kind of always
waiting for a savior and no savior is
going to come that's not how things work
uh it's uh you know you can people can
create the conditions under which some
decent person may become a spokesperson
but they don't come from above and
organize the movements I mean take say
Martin Luther King a very significant
person I respect him a lot he would have
been the first to tell you that he did
not create the Civil Rights Movement
Civil Rights Movement was created by U
young black activists in the South who
sat in at lunch counters uh rode Freedom
buses got beaten tortured killed tried
to register people formed the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
finally Drew in supporters from the
north you know finally had a big mass
movement and Martin Luther King was an
effective spokesperson for it and he
deserves plenty of credit for that I
don't criticize it but that's how
leaders come and interesting it's
interesting to notice what happened with
Martin Luther King there's now a
national holiday in the United States
Martin Luther King Day
and every year there's a lot of rhetoric
and what a wonderful person and so on
take a look at it almost invariably the
rhetoric stops with Martin Luther King's
I Have a Dream speech in
Washington okay which did lead to
significant civil rights legislation
because of the mass
movement he didn't stop there he went on
to confront class
issues he went on to the North in fact
when he was assassinated he was
supporting a public worker strike
sanitation worker strike in Memphis
Tennessee and he was on his way to form
to lead a March on Washington again to
form a Poor People's movement not a
black movement A Poor People's movement
to strike at class
issues uh he was
assassinated the March took place anyway
led by his widow they did set up a tent
city in Washington Resurrection
City this is the most liberal Congress
in American history they let it stay
there briefly then they sent in the
police in the middle of the night and
smashed it up and drove everybody out of
town uh that part of Martin Luther
King's history is
gone uh it's okay from the point of view
of a northern liberal it's fine to
attack racist sheriffs in
Alabama but don't look at what we're
doing that's not allowed and there was
not enough popular support for his later
efforts to succeed that's the fault of
people like us who didn't do the things
we should have done is not going to get
a leader who'll save you unless you do
the work then you can get
spokespersons but uh nothing else
[Applause]
[Music]
hi chsky thank you very much indeed for
this chance that I can actually ask this
question from you because this means a
lot to me uh I am a philosophy student
at the University of stutgart and I'm
more than lucky to be in German and
study philosophy because I was born in
1986 u under the bombs of Saddam Hussein
I'm a I'm a child of war and I know you
know what does that mean and I'm the
post um traumatic stress and everything
else I dislike my government more than
anything else like any other Iranian
activist but uh I know you that you left
your hometown Massachusetts to New York
in9 to support the Iranian uh hunger
strike I remember that and I saw the
pictures and I was very proud of that
but actually I want to make my I want to
I want to put my question here right now
because I know a lot of people are
waiting and uh I I I I've studied your
I've read um your articles about
cognitive science the philosophy of
language I'm a big fan I should say that
but my but my question is that U look
what what happened from the uh American
foreign policy shutting down the
civilians commercial airline and the US
general get a medal of honor for that
and still keeping that and killing more
than 250 passengers on board and
supporting the Iraq and financing Iraq
for the for the war and uh and the k M
and I ask myself that you're taking part
in the Iranian basically atom Atomic
talk between Iran and the European
countries and Russia and United States
and uh so this is this is going to be my
question it's like can we trust
Americans can we trust American policy
and if you don't is it going to be I
mean the the the Russia is it going to
be the best next option and if you're if
you're so much under pressure from
different sides and you are not a
developed country like Germany and uh if
you don't have many options on the table
what can you do what can I do do I have
a chance as an Iranian citizen as an
Iranian citizen well of course the uh
you know the
opt I mean the options under severe
repression are much greater or fewer
than the options for people like us here
who have many opportunities which we
don't
use uh so the situation in Iran could be
improved if the West had a different
position okay uh I would not presume to
tell Iranians what they should do under
the conditions they face they have to
figure that out for themselves but we
can ask questions what we should do so
for example uh right now the line in the
west is that Iran is the greatest threat
to World Peace okay you hear that all
the time I'm sure you hear it here uh
it's an interesting question why Iran is
the greatest threat to world peace I
mean that's
uh there's an answer you get it from us
intelligence and uh uh and the Pentagon
in their annual presentations to
Congress uh Iran is
disobedient uh Iran has very low
military
spending it has even by the standards of
the region its strategic Doctrine is
defensive it's designed to deter an
invasion long enough for diplomacy to
take place they say if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons which they
don't know uh it would be part of their
deterrent strategy to deter an attack
and the US and Israel and Germany and
their allies can't tolerate that no
country should have a deterrent against
Western
violence uh in the West IR is described
as the greatest threat the world peace
there are also International polls you
tell me whether they're reported here I
can tell you about the United States
last December there was an international
poll run by the major polling
organizations in the west gallop and the
United States it's British equivalent
and one of the questions that was asked
was which country is the greatest threat
to World
Peace guess which country was first so
far ahead that nobody else was even
close United
States okay now you tell me how it was
reported here in the United States the
media refused to report it with a single
exception a right-wing Murdoch rag
tabloid did report it and said look this
shows how crazy the world is you know
that's
uh I bet it wasn't a headline here
without looking well okay uh we can do a
lot of things about this in fact there's
something very concrete that we can do
actually the Germany can do there is U
you know p5+ one the security Council
plus Germany and there are whatever
threat people think you know conjure up
any threat you can make about Iranian
nuclear weapons there's a way to deal
with it very simple way uh it's on the
table uh move towards establishing a
nuclear weapons free zone in the region
okay is that possible yeah it's possible
in fact support for it is so strong that
even the United States has been forced
to formally say it's a good idea but not
now uh in December
2012 there was a there was supposed to
be a conference in Finland to carry
forward this plan for a nuclear weapons
free zone uh Israel announced that it
would not attend Iran announced that it
would attend with no conditions couple
of days later Obama cancelled the
conference okay uh the European
Parliament objected not Germany but the
European Parliament passed a strong
resolution saying it should go on Russia
called for it to go on the Arab states
wanted it to go on but if the US doesn't
support it and its allies don't don't
support it it's not going to happen well
that could be a significant step forward
that's concrete feasible it's not going
to happen without removing the darkness
you got to expose it and then doing
something about it I think that would
help Iranian disant it would help
removing the kinds of outside pressures
which give the hardliners their own
justification for crushing distance as
you know I'm sure so you know we can't
do a lot but we can do some things and
what Iranians should do I again would
not presume to tell
them thank
[Applause]
you I don't know how to
hello um Mr tomsky first of all I want
to thank you for being so
inspirational uh while you're holding
the speech I'm over
here oh
okay um while holding your speech there
was one thing keeping me uh busy I mean
you touched this topic already slightly
uh it's about uh corporations um you but
you still Focus very much on the
governmental level uh but observing an
increasing uh let's say intelligence and
and connectivity in uh huge or also in
small International
corporations and uh reaching a level of
let's say artificial intelligence
already um combining with what you said
uh about power being uh is Vanishing
when being dragged outside in the
sunlight uh I was asking
myself um what's your advice or or how
can we approach this to have uh more
power from this sector uh dragged into
the sunlight and uh be more visible and
uh second question what is uh maybe you
could lose a couple of more words on uh
how you see uh the power being uh
focused in this uh area thank you how is
power focused and what can we do to help
it to get to evaporate by opening it to
the
sunlight take a look at this
audience this happens all over the world
anywhere um the the there is an enormous
disparity between demand and
Supply I mean I see it every day when I
go home at night I'll get a couple of
dozen invitations to talk right every
time you talk anywhere wherever it is
around the world there's a huge mob of
people who are engaged interested
concerned and not and atomized not
organized very few people are willing to
answer
those demands there's just think about
it very few but it can be done by almost
you know any any person who has you have
to have a certain degree of privilege
you have to have enough privilege
to be able to spend your time doing some
research you know it's it's it's not
quantum theory I it's available to
anyone everything I said today anybody
could find out if they put the effort
into it not it's not profound you know
but you have to do it and uh that's the
way uh popular movements get organized
and when they become powerful enough
they can make major
changes there are no magic keys nobody's
ever discovered them it's always the
same way educate try to educate yourself
educate other people organize with
them pick the forms of activism that
make sense depending on the
circumstances there's no formulas and go
on as far as you can you're going to hit
a reaction then you have to be able to
confront it that's the way it's always
been the way it always will be and there
are no
limits
okay the FR last question please over
that hello good evening one final
question to Mr chsky how would you
comment on the fact that one of the
world's biggest companies is a private
military contractor in the frame of free
and risk Enterprise and all
that which
company should I speak
louder so how would you comment on the
fact that one of the biggest companies
in the world is a private military
contractor
a private military
contractor which one did you have in
mind well uh originally it was the
blackwat something oh Black Water name
some other thing yeah well uh you know
if you look at the history of
imperialism by and large the actual
atrocities and crimes were carried out
by
mercenaries uh often people from the
country
itself so you take a look at South
Africa under AAR heite some of the worst
atrocities were carried out by black
units mobilized you know to fight tribal
battles or one thing or another when the
British ran India it was the SE the
Indian soldiers who were suppressing the
population and who were providing the
forces for British aggression elsewhere
that's the French had a Foreign Legion
you know that's the usual pattern the
United States deviated from that pattern
uh in Vietnam and in Iraq it sent its
own
soldiers that for Imperial Conquest
that's not a good idea
civilians ordinary you can't take people
off the streets and in a year turn them
into brutal sadistic murderers it's hard
you know they have other instincts and
to its credit the US Army fell apart
uh in the
1960s the Army fell apart soldiers began
killing their officers and got hooked on
drugs finally the top military command
wanted to take them out because it was
destroying the military that's why they
moved to a professional Army no draes
professional Army uh now uh in more
recent years they've been going back to
the traditional Imperial P pattern
Mercenaries
they're called contractors not
mercenaries but if you look at the US
forces in Iraq and
Afghanistan um I think a majority of
problem are probably contractors like
the former Blackwood but that's the
traditional Imperial pattern it makes
sense for an imperial power to keep its
own civilians away from the vicious
dirty uh process of crushing and
destroying people you hand hand that out
to professional
Killers who were trained for it yeah
that's uh when South African aparte
collapsed the South African State
terrorist forces became
mercenaries they're picked up by Western
States to use for um for their own
Warfare so Blackwood are you know and
it's now changed its name are simply
reversions to the traditional sensible
Imperial pattern uh we don't have to
tolerate that of course that's up to us
[Applause]
