okay um thank you so much
uh gnome for allowing us uh your
a little bit of your precious time so do
you have
any estimate of when is that is there
a stop uh the hard stop time how how
much how much
well life is so impossible these days
okay okay fine and so please feel free
to
uh terminate it any time that you would
like to
i just um making after their other
interviews all around the world
it's just been fantastic it's
really important to get your message and
your analysis out there i've got very
good
positive feedback from the last one from
many people
um so my guest today is once again
professor noam chomsky
and we are carrying out the second part
of our interview
we started this two days ago and we were
unable to complete it because of
technical
difficulties professor chomsky
is a laureate professor of linguistics
at university of arizona
he's also the institute professor at mit
he doesn't need any further introduction
and i will not
waste his time any longer and i will go
right to the questions
um there was a question gnome submitted
by
a um i guess somebody who attended
the last session uh on the
question of uh uh
the bio warfare would you like to just
answer that or not answer that at this
point
what was the question okay the question
was um
do you think the pandemic could have
originated from a lab and do you believe
that the u.s china and other nations
are engaging in effective bio
warfare disguised under the so-called
biodefense
it's conceivable that the virus escaped
from a lab
none of the labs are foolproof but the
idea that it was released
i think is outlandish yes so
thank you i was going to just start with
foreign policy but
with the events in philadelphia and uh
that it it really
sort of urged me to ask you something
about
the situation that we face now with
racism
in american society and i believe that
for the first time in recent memory
racism and racist behavior of
police uh for the first time
in modern in recent history it has
become a central
issue in the in u.s uh
presidential election and as
as i just mentioned only two days ago uh
the police uh
murdered a black a person in front of
his
his mother what is your view of the
situation
are you concerned that race
riots could take place in this country
race riots have taken place
all through the history of this country
i
grew up in philadelphia oh i
left philadelphia when i was 20 years
old
when i was a teenager which was in the
during the second world war
uh there was a 7 p.m curfew
on teenage kids because there were
race riots breaking out all over uh i
remember i used to go to hebrew school
in the evening
i had to have a special permit with me
from with for my parents to be able to
get on the subway in case i was stopped
by policemen
you know that was i mean
you read just even literature of those
periods
james farrell writing about chicago
race riots all over the place i mean
racism is deeply embedded in american
society
what's happened it's a it's a
kind of a poison often right below the
surface
but sometimes it breaks out and trump's
genius has been to release it
he he has skills
he knows how to tap all of the
ugly vicious subterranean
features in the society and it's not
only the united states
to bring them to the public magnify them
and in fact what's happened is
this an increase in
visible uh tolerated
white supremacy at the same time there's
a counter current
that's been developed for years of
greater consciousness
and concern about racial issues and
white supremacy
you see this quite apart from trump so
for example the uh
take a couple year or two ago the new
york times
ran a significant
series 1619 they called
yes that exposing
the history of u.s uh
racism since 1619
they picked that date because that was
the day when the first
official uh
importation of slaves began and they
argued that this is a kind of a
mainstream of american history
that wouldn't have happened a few years
earlier
because but it's a matter of growing
developing
organizing activism consciousness
we saw how it broke out during the uh
after the george floyd murder yes uh
spontaneous development
enormous social movement developed
black white solidarity enormous popular
support
about two-thirds of the population
there's been
nothing like this before well that's the
positive side
the negative side is there's a backlash
and it's stirred up consciously by the
white house
and his echo chambers and fox news and
elsewhere
and he'd even see it in statistics like
take
terrorism the fbi
anti-defamation league a couple of
others keep regular figures
there's not a lot of terrorism in the
united states but it's there
when trump came into office in 2016
white supremacy was i think about maybe
10
or so of american terrorism
now it's a hundreds close to 100 it's
gone up every year that trump has been
in office consciously
stirred by the executive that's how he
sustains
his pop of his voting base
by appealing to the most
vulgar disgraceful features
of the culture and stirring them up
if he if we get rid of him which is not
obvious
to try to contain this poison and
suppress it will not be easy once you
let
poison loose it's not hearted it's not
hard to contain
i think you'll have a long-standing
effect on the nature of the society
it's kind of remarkable that a person of
such
monumental insignificance
has been able to have such an enormous
impact
on the society part of it is his
brilliance
in knowing which
which kind of poisonous dreams to tap
he understands that and he does it
brilliantly
you can see it in just about every
speech
absolutely that that is so what you're
saying is so
true another thing gnome is not
is not part of the discussion although
you occasionally hear about it is the
fact that
the united states has over 2 million
people in behind the bars and
and and a huge number of them
are african-americans well if you go
back to
1980 free reagan
uh you look at incarceration in the
united states as
compared with comparable countries
western countries
uh it was the united states was within
the spectrum
it was a little to the high end but
basically within the
western societies now
they're probably five to ten times as
high
it's not that crime has increased in
fact it's actually decreased
this is the result of racist policies
lots of uh i mean one
one of them is actually the uh the
federal level is just the drug war
it's not the only one but it's one
what's the drug war about well it was
actually initiated by
nixon but it's worth remembering that
nixon was the last liberal president in
the united states
so he was he had it was moderately
humane like other
aspects of the nixon administration this
is pre-neo-liberalism
nixon included in his drug war
prevention and treatment funding for
prevention and treatment
now there have been studies many one
rand corporation had a major one
studying the just the cost-benefit
analysis
of different kinds of ways of dealing
with drugs
turns out by far the most cost effective
and humane they didn't care about the
humanity they were looking at cost
effectiveness
is prevention and treatment much less
expenditure much better outcomes
as the drug war developed that's the one
that has
least funding virtually eliminated
the most effective the least funded
you take a look at uh police action
to stop it more expensive
less poorer outcomes more funding
take a look at border control far more
expensive
far worse outcomes far more fundy
take a look at out of country activities
like devastating poor colombian
farmers by chemical warfare
which is politely called fumigation i've
seen
i've been in southern colombia in poor
communities
everything's weighed down you see poor
farmers who developed a
niche market in europe for high quality
coffee
coffee's very tough market
the planes come by maybe they're
colombian but it's basically u.s
and spray the crops spray the crops
they destroy everything and also you
have kids running around with
sores on their arms and people dying and
so on
that's the least effective uh
and gets the most funding it's inverse
all the way across and one of the
effects is
there's also radical disproportion in
sentences
some of it's famous you know the rich
executive
snorts cocaine and his
westchester county home it's uh first of
all nobody will go after him
but if they do it's a light sentence if
some black kid is caught with a joint in
his pocket
uh maybe it'll be the third strike and
he'll go to jail forever
yes this is a social
political crime it doesn't have to
happen
and it's uh it's basically part of the
whole neoliberal
assault on the population it's this
completely
disposable people we're a
civilized country we don't just kill
them we
send them to jail exactly
clinton obama biden record on
criminal justice is not very good
uh as you we're talking about the
incarceration rate and a lot
is perhaps attributable to the 1994
crime bill that you i think you alluded
to the three strikes you are out
saying so now we see we reached a point
as you so correctly pointed out that
there is so much organizing all these
issues are absolutely in the
front burner so one would imagine that
in
in a future potential biden
administration
then he will have to deal with these
issues
right away and in a serious way
especially doing something about
the police violence on black people
would you agree
well first of all i think we should be
careful
not to fall into the trap the
establishment trap
of saying that elections
and who's in office are the heart of
politics
they're a small part of politics yes
real politics is
the pressures that are being developed
by popular
activist organizations that
compels those in office to change the
way they act
not all one of the
cancerous elements of the trump
administration
which is off the spectrum in many ways
is that they're immune to popular
pressure yes
they're stuck with their voting base
they want to cultivate it
they don't care about anything else so
whatever the public wants or is doing
it's
banking against closed doors but that's
never been true in the past
so take nixon again he was susceptible
to public pressures
on many issues that's why he was the
last liberal president
same with reagan the huge anti-nuclear
demonstrations in the early 80s were
undoubtedly a factor in
a number of his policies including uh
agreeing finally with gorbachev and the
inf treaty
which trump was dismantled aside from
trump
every political figure is susceptible
to political to activist pressures
and the answer to your question is will
the public make him do it
will there be real pressures on the
administration
to deal in a humane and
sane fashion with the
dramatic incarceration
crime in the united states they can't
actually it's worth remembering on the
1994 crime bill
that the congressional black caucus
supported the bill yes because black
communities
suffer from the increasing crime
that's a consequence of the
impoverishment
racism and repression it's a complicated
cycle
racism deep racism leads to
black communities living in deplorable
conditions
which is crimeogenic you know creates
crime
then they want protection from the crime
in their own communities so you get a
cycle which is kind of counterproductive
but perfectly understandable
it's kind of like to take an example
actually there's a good article today in
the
bulletin of atomic scientists which
describes one of the
pathologies that's driving us that may
drive us to total destruction
that's the minutemen what they point out
is that as what's called kind of like a
sponge
for absorbing incoming missiles
back in the 60s you know
miss icbm missile bases were scattered
all over
rural areas so in case there's
uh an outbreak of war they'll totally be
you know what
be wiped out instantly they want it
so that's the interesting thing the
pressure
from a strategic point of view they're
senseless
totally senseless they have no strategic
value
they simply increase the threat
that in a moment of crisis the president
will have to push the button
it's this to use it or lose it
story with icbms they're all targeted by
certainly by russia maybe even by others
you know exactly where they are
you know exactly how to hit them and
destroy them so if there's a couple of
minutes warning you can't take chances
yeah from a strategic point of view
they're a disaster and just about every
specialist wants to get rid of them
but the rural communities which are the
target
are organizing in fact massive lobbying
with
yes some arms producers to keep them
there
because it's a source of employment yeah
missile voices out
yeah none of them precious so here's
totally suicidal the worst victims
they want them there's kind of a
microcosm of that
in the black communities that because of
the
circumstances of uh endemic racism and a
long history of repression
they are in high crime areas so they
want
a police and incarceration which harms
them
i mean these are non-trivial social
problems
i mean is it that they sort of feel that
70 years have uh
gone by and we although there were many
close calls that but we we avoided
a nuclear exchange and that there is uh
no reason to believe right now that
there would be
something like that happening so this is
these are these silos are creating jobs
you just put yourself in the position of
someone who's living in one of these
small rural towns scattered around the
midwest
right they hear from first of all they
don't hear much
but because it's never discussed but
they may pick up a story somewhere
saying that
rich elites in new york
say we ought to get rid of these things
which is going to get rid of the church
the the grocery store and the school
where my kids go and so on
so what's my decision why do i trust
those guys anyway
they never do anything for me you know i
don't trust them they're just a bunch of
pointy headed
elite intellectuals we think we're
deplorables
so i'm not going to pay attention to
them i'm going to pay attention to
the things right around me and i don't
want my
town destroyed because some
rich elite guy somewhere says
it's a strategic danger what do i know
about that
okay that's the mentality and it
keeps us driving on a course towards
suicide yes
i'm glad that you started talking about
the nuclear opens that i know that is of
course
one of your major concerns now along
with the uh
issue of climate change and you spoke
about the
uh intermediate range nuclear forces
treaty
the dissolution of that rather in the
interview with with with aaron amate and
also the new star treaty
so there is some uh
good news norm and that is uh
and i want to get your take on it and
that is the ratification
the 50th ratification of the tpnw
the prohibition of nuclear weapon the
treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons
and honduras is the 50th country that
ratified
so we have now uh the treaty going into
force after the 50th ratification
uh 84 countries have signed it so there
are
34 still remaining to ratify but
the point i i would just also point out
that 109
other u.n member states that have not
signed the treaty and they they include
all of the major western states
except like ireland and austria and
lichtenstein
that have not signed it and not a single
nuclear weapon state recognized or
otherwise
has signed it do you think this is
this uh ratification by honduras is
truly significant as far as disarmament
goes it could be significant
if usual comment
if the public became organized to
develop
pressures to implement it now there are
interesting
issues here a couple of years ago i
haven't seen
more recent polls but about maybe
five or ten years ago maybe 10 years ago
there were polls extensive polls on u.s
populate the u.s population's attitude
towards international agreements towards
the united nations
and the results were pretty startling
turned out
that a majority of the population
thought that the united nations ought to
take the lead
in international affairs not the united
states
and that if a majority of the united
nations
decided on some policy the united states
should follow it
even if we don't think it's in our
interest
that was actually a majority of the
population
in any elite circles you couldn't even
can't even talk about this
yes it's so remote from anyone's
thoughts
and these are people who never heard it
you can't find a
article in the press in journals
anywhere else saying the united states
ought to
back off and let and follow world
opinion
on international issues it's not even
speakable
in eight lead circles but it was the
general opinion of the population
some of the popular attitudes also held
that
we should give up the veto actually ben
page
wrote a book a couple couple of year a
couple years after this which
has a lot of data on these reports
benjamin page
media analyst forgot the name of the
book
but it's a it's an interesting
collection of these new
data but it's mainstream media is never
mentioned
yes that shows opportunities like a lot
of other things that are never mentioned
i mean the you know we don't have
formal censorship in the united states
but we have a system
in which things of enormous importance
are just kept from the public yes
absolutely there's a general question
i this is i have been sort of mulling
over it
that after the tpnw ratification by
honduras
that this whole business of what used to
be
quite frequently
discussed in in resolution to the
general assembly and so forth and that
is
the notion of nuclear disarmament
to be accompanied by general and
complete
disarmament now this notion has totally
disappeared from the lexicon
and do you think that truly nuclear
disarmament
is possible without some sort of
general disarmament or that's a pipe
dream
well i think nuclear disarmament should
be a
very high priority because
for obvious reasons uh
if if uh you
you know the history better than i do
you look over the history of the last 75
years
it's almost a miracle that we've escaped
there's been time after time when things
became
very close dangerously close
sometimes a couple of minutes of
decision making
often by accident typically by accident
you know misinterpreting uh in
automated uh collection of data
sometimes as a result of reckless
actions of government
but they're just too many cases
and the idea that you can live forever
with miracles is
yes pretty stupid so yes there ought to
be
very serious moves towards limitation
and sooner or later elimination of
nuclear weapons
it's not a wild idea and it's been
advocated for example by people like
henry kissinger
and you mentioned bill perry of course
the other day i'm not
leading william perry leading figures in
the weapons of the establishment
but general disarmament should go along
with it i mean the
amount that is spent in
means of destruction is just shocking
especially when there are enormous human
needs that have to be met
now that's not easy take say
india and pakistan india and pakistan
are already at storage points over all
kinds of issues
i just think a couple of years ahead
what happens in
south asia when the region is becoming
almost unlivable under global warming
yes the rivers that provide water are
declining to nuclear armed states
and struggling over how to divide up the
diminishing water resources
it's you don't even want to think about
it
and of course if anything breaks out in
south asia
we're probably all doomed heavily armed
uh nuclear states conflict between them
might bring about the kind of nuclear
winter which would
devastate everyone yes yes of course
um no i uh that's that one one thing
norma
uh that your warnings about this trump
administration's
uh near certain almost decision now i
think
not to extend the the new start
is is so dangerous on top of it
one thing that is uh quite unique
that even during the height of the cold
war there was a hotline between moscow
and washington
there was back channel discussions uh
kissinger was doing the back channel
before the abm treaty
that you mentioned the last time but now
there is no communication whatsoever is
what i understand
between at any significant level between
moscow and washington
it's part of the general breakdown of
the international the system of
international order
uh forgotten whether we talked about
this last time but
there was a dramatic illustration of it
just a couple of weeks ago
uh the united nations
sanctions on iran yes did you discuss
this
okay don't repeat it but we heard you at
uh aaron mate not not to the mit
audience so please
please yes what happened i mean it was
you could see it in the press but didn't
get the kind of reaction i thought it
should
absolutely there are sanctions against
iran
my opinion they shouldn't be there in
the first place but let's put that aside
uh the united nations sanctions were
part of the
jcpoa the joint agreement and they ran
out
of the united states has dismantled the
joint agreement
the sanctions ran out the united states
wanted them to renew
it approached the security council and
called on the security council to renew
the sanctions
total opposition not a single u.s
ally agreed in fact the only country
that agreed was colombia
the u.s client state the rest of the
security council refused
so what happened secretary of state
mike pompeo who comes right out of some
gangster movie hollywood casting
literally just look at him came to the
security council
and told the members of the security
council
sorry you are reinstituting the
sanctions
period
what can they do if any
european country says you can't dictate
to us what the security council does
they get tossed out of the international
financial system yes
which is run through washington uh well
that's what it's like when the world is
run like the mafia and it's not that
people are unaware of it
the main financial new
business newspaper and the angle of the
english-speaking world
is the financial times in london it's
most
respected the distinguished columnist
the martin wolf
conservative wrote a recent uh
column in which he said under trump
the international order is in
serious crisis and if trump is elect
reelected it will be terminal
terminal that's a
not a voice at the fringe that's a
sober restrained voice right at the
center
that's what we're facing and what
happened at the
security council as a case in point
uh the question of the new start treaty
is another one
trump has already dismantled
the inf treaty of the open size treaty
to us back to eisenhower uh threatened
the use of threatened
nuclear weapons tests hasn't happened
for almost
30 years uh and
has been delaying on the new start
negotiations
with one after another frivolous
objection
russians have been repeatedly
asking let's renew it let's renegotiate
it
recently they just said let's extend it
for a year
to give us some time no more objections
and now it seems that maybe
maybe there's some chance of a renewal
has to come before february but it's
been delayed so long that it's
very very much at risk and that's
basically the end of the arms control
regime
trump has dismantled the rest of it
actually the first step was taken by
george w bush who dismantled the abm
treaty but then trump came along
everything
and there's something very striking
about the trump administration
very dramatic uh he has nothing much in
the way of policies
but there's one clear definite policy
if any international arrangement
exists that he didn't craft that has to
be destroyed
notice the consistency everything
just wrecking ball i didn't do it
destroy it if i did it the greatest deal
of the century
uh this is uniform
and it's the way it attacks americans is
astonishing
so a couple of weeks ago uh
trump pulled out of the international
consortium
kovacs which is working on developing
vaccines
and on distributional issues like
trying to ensure that the rich don't
take everything
uh international consortium americans
benefit from that
and it's perfectly obvious that the best
way to
develop vaccines is to work together i
mean
it can't even be a question and the
distributional problems are quite real
but he didn't create it so we destroy it
uh the pretext was for destroying it was
that the world health organization is
involved we got to destroy the world
health organization
because trump needs a scapegoat
for his killing a couple hundred
thousand americans through his
incompetence so we'll blame the world
health organization
destroy that there's a biodiversity
conference
in progress i think about 160 countries
one is missing the impact of loss of
biodiversity is
extraordinary 40 of
plant species have already been
destroyed
insect populations are sharply
diminishing
other species are being destroyed at
extraordinary rate
the effect quite apart from everything
else is an enormous
effect for humans but
he didn't start it destroy it okay
this is not i should say this is not
unique with
trump but he's carried it to an extreme
u.s has pulled out of has a ridiculous
record on international treaties and
agreements
it accepts almost none of them and those
that it does ratify
have reservations excluding the united
states
this goes far back but like
everything else that's wrong with the
system it's been exaggerated by trump
to a lethal degree a new start is
another example of this
one interesting thing about talking
about all this i mean this
kind of entails your discussions about
the
the lack of rule of law and that we are
really
almost a pariah state when it comes to
international affairs but the
interesting part i find is also there is
that that even between democrats
and and and trump biden and trump when
it comes to foreign policy
there is sometimes more hawkishness on
the part of the democrats
so if trump wants to make a
have a good relation with north korea or
vladimir putin
for whatever reason the democrats are
are opposing it and uh and biden himself
is a really a very strong
interventionist
so this is i think it's a problem do you
agree
yeah the problem is where it always is
the lack of popular activism
to force the democrats to abandon these
crazed policies but you're absolutely
right
at the level of rhetoric at least
there's
not much difference i mean the democrats
probably wouldn't have
destroyed the arms control regime right
and they i don't know if they would have
carried out the provocative actions
that trump is now implementing in the
off the coast of china or off the
borders of russia
which is very dangerous um there are big
problems
in the south china sea and china's doing
things that are
illegal and they shouldn't be doing yes
but you don't send the
whole pacific fleet in there to try to
show how tough we are these are issues
that require
negotiation and diplomacy and you're not
hearing it from the democrats
that's correct but as we were saying
before
they're at least susceptible to pressure
if
the pressure is there if it's not there
won't happen that is absolutely right
um because one example that you
mentioned
and is also i thought about is
um is this assassination of solemnity
uh qasim sulaimani in iraq and and
and and you have said that this is
really something so unprecedented even
you know since the second world war that
you go and assassinate
a a major general in in a
in in the iranian government and um
but there was as you mentioned at that
time i heard you
saying is no protest from the democrats
in fact this could you can trace this
back to
abraham langan who
made a powerful statement that that
the assassination of a foreign leader
even if you're at war with him is the
worst crime
and the states have lived up to that
during the second world war they lived
up to it
you know i mean this breaks
huge precedent and in fact just imagine
that
iran exposed that iran had
assassinated uh mike pompeo
uh in a and
an american hive high official another
one
at a in the mexico city airport
would we have thought that's fine
well that's what the united states did i
mean
southlandish when you talk about the
united states being
an international pariah it's also worth
mentioning
that there's a bipartisan consensus
that the constitution of the united
states
doesn't matter it's very easy to show
take a look at article six of the
constitution
says a treaty entered into by the united
states
has to be observed by all officials all
judges everyone well the main treaty
that's been
modern times that's been entered into by
the united states
is the united nations charter the basic
instrument of international law post-war
era
actually initiated by the united states
and take a look at
article 2.4 it says
the threat or use of force
in international affairs is borrowed
with exceptions that are irrelevant okay
does any american president live up to
that
exactly i mean every america first of
all they use force
but the threat of force is common so
every american president
blithely violates the u.s constitution
and you don't hear one word about it
from law schools
from international lawyers
part political parties and so on yeah
we want to throw the constitution of the
waste basket fine
yeah this same same issues came up again
recently with trump's decision to uh
move the uh
u.s embassy to jerusalem and then the
annexation of golan
and uh and and and and alex
annexation of the of the west bank as
well that
netanyahu was contemplating and there
was chuck schumer
who was openly supporting these
decisions that
are totally against united nations
resolutions
yes explicit security council
resolutions
which the united states voted for yes
ma'am
but there are several of them but it
doesn't matter
it's us we are the godfather
we do whatever we like in fact this
greatest deal of the century is quite
interesting
i suppose that the plan
[Music]
the sort of so-called greatest deal
which was actually handed by
written by netanyahu handed by tajard
kishner to
bring to the public suppose any other
country in the world
had proposed it i suppose china
had proposed it or germany people
wouldn't even bother to laugh
it's a ridiculous crazed plan
total violation of international law
everybody in the world is opposed to it
if say germany had proposed it
you wouldn't even bother to laugh the
united states proposal
it's the law everyone has to adhere to
it
now the immediate reaction to it was
well how could we accommodate to this
not let's disregard it and throw it into
the west
waste basket where it belongs but how
can we accommodate it to it
that's the mafia that's
the international system the godfather
runs it
and the godfather's edicts have to be
obeyed
and we don't even question it it's just
taken for granted
it's just like the sun rising okay it
tells you a lot
not just not just about international
order
what about the culture that lies behind
it
why isn't there an uproar about this why
is it just automatically accepted
i mean even if you're forced to accept
it
by the threat of u.s power and countries
are
you could still have vocal objection to
it you could have
efforts to try to create counter forces
like does europe europe have to allow
the united states to run the world
it's got a bigger economy than the
united states
educationally more advanced
plenty of capacity to be
an effective force in world affairs
subordinated to u.s power
i was actually surprised by the united
uh i mean the security council
decision to uh not endorse the
u.s proposal to snap back sanctions in
iran
i didn't think that the europeans would
have the backbone
to actually do that were you surprised
or also do you think
that is sort of hard of things to come
notice what they did
they didn't vote against it they
abstained abstained yes
right they don't want to irritate the
godfather
so they let the russians and the chinese
take the
blame okay um
yeah and you also mentioned that the end
of the arms control because of the
start new start treaty coming uh is in
not going to be extended the other thing
that
two other things norm um that i would
like to bring to your attention
is the crisis of the npt which actually
you had
alluded to in in another interview and
that is the
uh nuclear weapons free zone in the
middle east which
creates this incredible existential
problem but also that it is going to be
a major
problem for the npt
renewal when it comes up for review
hopefully next year
and then there is the paris the um
prevention of arms race in
outer space that the u.s has been
blocking
uh there is this a whole new uh
not news i said they're very old in the
sense that the all these people were in
the saddle
during the star wars are now back
running the show
at the pentagon and they don't want to
have anything to do
with uh um arms control in space
i don't know if you have been thinking
about those as well that's
actually you're quite right about the
arms control in space they want it
they don't want arms control they want
to develop
space as an arena of
conflict and potential destruction more
interesting however i think is the
nuclear weapons-free zone that's very
interesting
notice that uh both parties in the
united states
obama trump bush have been
for years claiming that the greatest
threat to world peace
is iran and the iranian nuclear programs
well that's actually nonsense but let's
accept it
let's say it's true is there a way to
solve that problem yes establish a
nuclear weapons free zone
in the middle east with intensive
inspections
which can work they worked very well
during the
period before the trump dismantled the
joint agreement even american
intelligence agrees
so nuclear weapons-free zone with
intensive expected
intensive investigation who's opposed
not the arab states they've been
vigorously pressing for this for
25 years not iran
which strongly supports it openly and
strongly supports it
global south most of the world 130
countries
vigorously supporting it europe supports
it
what's the problem the problem is
bipartisan agreement in the united
states
every time it comes up for
uh discussion the us vetoes
most recent was obama
2015 npt review sessions
yes came up obama vetoed it
well and it's coming up again as you say
in a couple of months
the u.s will veto it whoever's in office
why very straightforward reason
it would mean inspecting israel's
nuclear weapon system the u.s won't
allow that
in fact the u.s does not officially
recognize
that israel has nuclear weapons it's not
a question of course it's perfectly open
but the us won't recognize it there's a
reason
u.s law the signing to an amendment
the provisions require that
u.s military and economic aid
has to be ended for countries that
develop
nuclear weapons outside the npt
framework
neither political party wants to
open that can of worms so in order
to protect the israeli
nuclear weapons and probably
are arguably illegal usaid to israel
they're willing to face a major what
they call the greatest threat to world
peace
this is pretty interesting and nobody
will talk about it
outside the arms control community you
can't find a
comment about it i mean it's it's been
pretty interesting for me personally
i've been shouting from the rooftops
about this for
years when you talk to an audience
they understand in two minutes can't go
beyond
nobody can say it try to find something
saying uh and we're fake we are
willingly
facing major threats what we call the
greatest threat to world peace
in order to protect arguably illegal
us aid to israel if the general public
understood this that would be an outcry
from all sorts of circles including
circles who for
terrible reasons are opposed to foreign
aid all together
i mean uh i think you'd have an
overwhelming
opposition to this across the spectrum i
think that's probably the reason it's
never mentioned
got to keep it secret from the public
because if they knew this
they might insist that we move on
and that's against the interests of the
lobbyists the funders the donors
that the two political parties obey
and that the intellectual community uh
maintained silence about because they're
part of the act as well
this is a very broad problem absolutely
it's very interesting like what what
you're saying that
the stranglehold of the
pro-israel lobbying on u.s politics on
both sides of the aisle so to speak
i think there is uh i don't know this
this is really something that you know
so much about
is the whether there is a my question is
whether there is
do you sense a change in that
this uh this total grip on
american politics as a third rail like
you're saying you cannot talk about it
because just the attacks that came down
on ilhan omar a first-term
sudanese or american
congresswoman from minnesota and rashida
talib from detroit
that that they went after these two
people with like a
big hammer that made me think that they
must
sense some that any kind of a breed
should be dangerous
very much so and remember it's not just
the two political parties it's also the
general intellectual community
yes um have you read an article about
this
i mean it's transparent any
teenage kid can understand it but nobody
will talk about it
uh the iran nuclear
the nuclear weapons free zone uh
is there a change very definitely i
think it's frightening people in power
if you look at public opinion polls
public opinion is shifting very sharply
on this issue
you go back uh 10 or 20 years
the popular support for israel
was based primarily in
liberal democrats israel was
the darling of the american liberals
that has been true since 1967.
uh that's changed by now
uh liberal opinion actually is
even more favorable to the palestinians
than to israel
repeated israeli crimes have undermined
seriously liberal support that's
particularly true among young people
including young jews incidentally
it's a popular support for israel has
shifted
to the far right to uh
right-wing ultra-nationalists uh
military elements uh
and uh the evangelicals
that's the base of popular support for
israel
so that those who are trying to maintain
the traditional line know that they're
fighting a dangerous battle
if popular opinion begins to affect
policy they're in trouble okay
and i think that's part of the reason a
large part
where there is such a total censorship
on perfectly obvious things like
overcoming the
alleged iranian threat by simply
recognizing that israel has nuclear
weapons
you can't talk about it
and i think the reason is what you said
it's close to the breaking point
thank you so much norm i i don't know if
you are now
totally rushed out if you have time for
two more questions
okay let's okay uh on this on the
matter of uh election interference by
russia
so interference by russia dominated the
news
ever since trump's election in 2016.
democrats have been relentless in this
effort
and and we don't really know what really
happened with those
so-called russian interference but on
the other hand
trump is delegitimizing this election do
you think that that's trump's
effort to de-legitimize the election
process
is more of a threat than this um
some facebook posts by some russian
troll or something
by maybe a factor of 10 000.
i mean whatever the russians are doing i
don't know there's no there have been
some careful studies even government
commissions nobody nobody can find a
detectable effect
but anyways there were i mean it doesn't
begin to compare
say with israeli interference with
american policy it's not not in the same
it's not even the same uh arena and it's
perfectly open
like when netanyahu didn't like the uh
iran deal yes he went to he was invited
to a joint session of congress
absolutely where he was applauded by
democrats and republicans
for saying your policies are all wrong
obama's policies are wrong
is that interference plus tons of other
things and
all of this pales into insignificance in
comparison with the
interference in american elections by
corporate and wealthy campaign funding
that is an overwhelming impact on
elections
is that interference uh how about
uh trying to destroy the post office
so that it won't deliver ballots yes
is that interference with american
elections what about purging
voter lists to make sure that the wrong
people don't vote
i mean interference in american
elections is overwhelming
even if he could find something from
russia it would be a straw and a
mountain
and it's the democrats are pushing this
yes just like the democrats
push the impeachment proceedings
completely suicidal yes
anybody could have told them in advance
this is going to be a gift to trump
yes for obvious reasons even if he can
find
something it's going to be voted down in
the senate
so you lose and then trump gets up and
says i was vindicated
yes i mean i don't know if they're just
totally incompetent utterly stupid
uh russiagate impeachment
whatever it is it's just a sign
of their absolute inability to act
politically
even in their own interests
i can't understand i can't understand a
lot of things
one final thing is about this election
business i there is a book i
actually it was a presentation at mit uh
two years ago
this young political scientist at boston
college she did her
dissertation on cataloging u.s
interference during the cold war in
other countries elections and
more than just interference um and she
she documented at least 72 cases
of uh such interference and uh we
hear nothing about this uh us
um continuing uh even even during the
clinton administration they
they uh throughout um um president
zamaya uh from
honduras and there's just no mention of
any of these uh take
the bill clinton and the russian
election of
1996 the u.s intervened massively
to try to ensure that their boy yelsen
would be
elected correct and they were proud of
it it wasn't hidden
it was a sign of pride that it succeeded
but remember the us doesn't just
interfere in elections
it doesn't like the election outcome it
overthrows the government
yes it's a pretty serious intervention
in fact
just just yesterday the chileans
finally eliminated the pinochet
the constitution how did that get
established
the u.s overthrew the allende government
it's not interference
we don't like it we stick in a
dictatorship
we don't bother with interference so the
victory of the
in venezuela i'm sorry not venezuela
bolivia
everywhere is venezuela the united
states
supported a military coup in 2002
which overthrew the whole government not
just the
government of the united states the new
york times the
liberal press thought it was wonderful i
mean it was
beaten back by the venezuelan people in
a couple of days
but when it took place there was
overwhelming support for it
that's our job to overthrow governments
we don't like
and of course to interfere with
elections yes
small potatoes no do you have a final
advice
for the progressive community in
particular
uh six days before the elections
i think the main advice to keep in mind
is that elections are a very small part
of real politics if you
accept the there is an establishment
view
which says the public has no role
in the political system public has a
function
show up every four years push a button
and then you become what lipman called
spectators not participants as long as
we accept that
we're in deep trouble real politics
means
continuing the activism and the
pressures
the organizing the educational
activities
constantly keep their feet to the fire
put pressures on or nothing will happen
okay they'll just retreat back to the
conservative for the democrats the
clintonite
donor-oriented conservatives uh same
everywhere and public pressure works
we've said worked for nixon worked for
reagan
worked for franklin delano fact
you remember he pleaded for it he said
maintain the pressure i'll never get
anything through
that's politics we made the left
progressives made a terrible mistake
when obama came in
they abandoned everything they said
we've got this wonderful guy now let's
put our faith in
he had two years when he had control of
congress betrayed the public
badly so badly that working people have
voted for him
switched to trump within two years it
was
not trump then the republicans okay do
that again with biden you'll get the
same thing
on the other hand if you keep the
pressure up you can make changes
i think that's the main lesson should be
kept in mind
nom chomsky thank you so much for
giving me one more hour of your such
precious time and this fantastic
interview um we miss you in boston
but uh please enjoy the sunshine in
arizona and
uh we'll be in touch thank you so much
again
