so we're talking about evolution on
acquisition
uh the there's a little bit of
evidence about evolution very little in
fact
to try to get evolutionary evidence
about anything is extremely difficult
and of course there's no direct evidence
naturally
so you have to reconstruct from very
fragmentary evidence
uh in the case of cognitive capacities
like language there's no direct evidence
at all of course
nobody took paper recordings a hundred
000 years ago
so what you have to do is reconstruct
and these soft tissues of the brain
don't
fossilize so all you know about the
brain is the skull which tells me
something but
not a lot and then there are artifacts
that
lead to some plausible speculations
so it's a very weak weak inferences
about
the human evolution all together
and it does not go as far as answering
the kind of question that
michael just raised so we really can't
say
maybe that happened maybe
uh professor chomsky my question
concerns your reversal of the
aristotelian maxim regarding sound and
meaning
um the greeks would have uh aristotle
himself would have
relied on the idea that idin is both
thinking and speaking as a
chronologically uh chronological moment
at the same time
is there from cognitive neuroscience
then a suggestion that
there is uh something that we can say
that precedes the external expression uh
that is itself however discrete
and language related such that we can
say that there is
not the occurrence at the same time but
rather a chronological occurrence of
some sort of language neural activity
and then we're making an expression of
that
well the evidence doesn't really come
from neuroscience
and it's a little bit like the question
about evolution not enough is known
about the brain
we do know a lot about say the human
visual system
but that's from experimentation with
other animals
so invasive experimentation with say
cats and monkeys can teach you a lot
about the
detailed neurology of the visual system
in the case of and humans have
approximately the same visual system so
concludes that our system probably works
the same way
but in case of language you just can't
do that
there are no other animals that have the
capacities
so you can't to compare it in a
neurology to try to imagine what the
human language capacity is uh so the
evidence does not come from
um there is evidence for neuroscience
but it's mostly about localization
the evidence comes from
what you can find out about the brain by
of electrical activity and so on
maybe the fmri as it's called studies
movement of the blood and the brain that
kind of thing gives you some information
but nothing about the detailed neurology
so there's very little neurological
evidence
however there's pretty strong evidence
from
language design the way language works
that it is essentially designed for
thought not for speech or some other
form of
externalization externalization seems to
be
independent of modality so sign works
pretty much the same way speech does
theoretically use other modalities
but uh and in fact people can learn
language from extremely limited
uh tactile evidence like putting your
hand on the face and so on that was
deaf-blind
can learn the language that way very
well
in fact that helen keller
the uh there's no experimentation
so it seems to be modality independent
uh there is
design evidence from the nature of
language
it's a little bit like what i mentioned
the other day i just barely touched on
it
but if you look closely at the nature of
language the nature of the computational
procedures
it turns out that they directly
yield structures that are interpretable
for thought
but then they're modified in the process
of externalization
so that they actually lead to
communication problems again because of
minimization
operations so it looks very much as if
language is a thought system
and then externalization comes along
later
actually there's pretty good reason is
good as i mentioned you can
you don't learn a lot from about
evolution but there's some
reasonable speculations
one which is in fact
accepted by some leading evolutionary
biologists
and nobel laureates and so on is that
if you think about what must have
happened at some point
as was just pointed out at some point
in the evolutionary record uh some
humans must have our remote ancestors
that must have acquired the capacity
which
animals lack to construct
some operation that yields
an infinite array of structural
expressions
i mean all the humans have that capacity
you go back
say 100 000 years there's no evidence
that the capacity existed anywhere
so somewhere and then and as i think i
mentioned the other day
in the last roughly 50 000 years there
has been no evolution to speak of
but all humans are essentially identical
in this capacity
which means that somewhere in a pretty
narrow window
this computational operation appeared
well that's
presumably some slight rewiring of the
brain
but the result of some mutation
whether a mechanism known but a mutation
takes place in an individual
uh found that something happened to her
she had a slight genetic mutation she
ended up having this capacity
well he then had the capacity to think
she could construct uh arbitrarily
complex expressions in her mind she's
related to the thought system
uh she could plan interpret uh
do all sorts of things that the other
people in her
tribe couldn't do but these people were
living in small
groups groups maybe
maximum maybe a couple hundred people
probably less
but she was alone she was the one person
i think
that alone tells us that language
probably was designed for thought
not speech well presumably this capacity
to think
provided some sort of selection
advantage
she was a little better off than other
people
the ability would have partially been
transmitted to offspring
they would have been slightly better off
than anyone else
pretty soon you have a group of people
in the tribe
who are a little have some advantage
that others don't have
well a small selection advantage can
spread it can lead to more reproduction
essentially
what it means it's not a simple matter
it has been shown that selectional
advantages
do not very rarely translate
into extension of the selection
advantage it obviously sometimes happens
we're not all
bacteria so it sometimes happens but
pretty rarely uh nevertheless so as far
as we know this might have happened
any number of times in human history but
they've never survived
well once we know it survived because
we're here
we all have the capacity so somehow it
survived pretty soon the the
hunter-gatherer group had a lot of
people and it had this capacity
at that point it might have occurred to
some
smart guy that it would be useful to
externalize it
uh then you could figure out what
somebody else was thinking
so modes of externalization were
developed
uh many different ones there's many
different ways to externalize what's
inside
so it comes out of the mouth the hands
and whatever was used to communicate
and in fact there are many different
ways of externalizing we see it
right in front of us what we call a lot
of different languages
are probably just different ways of
externalizing
i mean it could turn out you can't prove
this yet but it
could turn out that the
variety of languages reduces to variety
of externalization
i mean experience tends to conform to
that
so for example if one of you decides to
learn a second language
now what you're going to study is the
externalization
you cannot study the uh fundamental the
core
uh principles for one reason you can't
study it because nobody knows them
so nobody can teach them to you by now
something is known about them but it's
part problem
it's kind of like learning to see
you don't learn to see by figuring out
by being taught
how the visual system works of course
so when you're learning a language you
think about it you learn the
sound system you learn the morphology
the inflections the irregular verbs
you learned a couple of things about
order you know german and
slightly different word than english and
so on
those are all very superficial things
but that's where the complexity of
language is
and that's essentially all that you
learn but you can't learn you learn some
very superficial things about meaning
very superficial but which word which
meaning goes for which sound
but that's true and it's learned very
fast
i mean it's known from experimental
evidence that children
pick up the meaning of words being very
young children
extremely quickly they may learn a child
may learn you know eight or ten words a
day
which means they're basically learning
them on one exposure
and somehow they already know the rich
complex meaning
that's inside somewhere and they just
attach it to some sound
uh as far as the syntax and the
rules of form semantics go there's no
way of learning
they've just got to be in there and
somehow used when
enough stimulation occurs like other
capacities well this
suggests that the
variety and complexity of language is
actually in a
secondary system in the externalization
system
and what you would expect is that the
core
nature of language would just
come about by uh basically laws of
nature
that's what i meant the other day by
saying it could turn out it's kind of
like a snowflake
it just developed by laws of nature laws
of
computational complexity and so on uh
anyhow that's the kind of
evidence i mean i don't want to
overstate that none of this is proven
there's just sort of evidence in this
direction which would indicate that the
aristotelian
victim should be reversed
you already mentioned a language
acquisition
i'm interested in something how you
are how you now consider
language acquisition in the new
framework
of the minimalist program because uh
before in the principle and parameter
theory it was clear that you said um
okay there's
some principles and um when a child
acquires a language then
it has to acquire the parameters
uh but now in the in the minimalist
program the principles
are if i've got that right unabolished
and they
are replaced by the operations merchant
move
uh what impact has this own language
acquisition or how do you see
language acquisition now in this new
framework
well maybe the phrase
minimalist program should never have
been used it's mislead people
i've tried to explain it many times but
i think there's a principle about
language and that is if anything
can be misunderstood it will be
misunderstood
like almost 100 percent i mean it's for
the
human sciences generally but
the minimalist program is an extension
of what's been done since the beginning
it's a little different because
research reached the point where it
seemed that you couldn't
try a new research paradigm it's just a
different way of doing research with the
same program essentially
the different way of doing research was
to
suggest it is we might ask what would be
a perfect system
and then ask how look at the discrepancy
between that and what we actually appear
to see
and then proceed to see if you can
overcome the discrepancy well that's a
research program it's not a thesis
and it's been a pretty productive one
but
as far as principles and parameters are
concerned that's essentially the same
so this approach would sharply simplify
the principles
and maybe it would somehow simplify the
parameters what it would suggest that
this
comes out of what i was saying before 30
years of
work trying to show this that the
parameters are in the externalization
i mean it could it could turn out can't
prove it again but
it could turn out that in the core
syntactic semantic system
basis of language design there's no
variation at all
that's a pretty plausible expectation
because of the
rapidity with which it's acquired
and the impossibility of teaching
anything
and that would go down to things like
the meaning of words and so on and so
forth
so it could be that it'll turn out that
the
core of language has no parametric
variation
and that the parametric choices have to
do with the
various aspects of externalization so
sound system morphology inflection
irregular
and notice that the externalization is
very susceptible to external
influences so say the norman invasion
in england changed the language
radically
it became sort of french like uh
and in fact a teenage jargon is a
typical way in which languages change
and very quickly in fact um and
uh it's it is very susceptible to
influence i mean like my children for
example
that don't speak the way i do they speak
the way their friends do
you know the children tend to pick up
the language of their peers not the
language of their parents
for whatever reason so you get pretty
good reasons but
sometimes parents aren't too happy about
the reasons but
the uh it's pretty well known
so it could turn out that's what your
point is quite correct
it could turn out that the parameters
really are in the externalization system
but you have to find them and there's
been a lot of
difficulty in finding them in fact the
inquiry into parameters has
tended to show that they fall into two
quite different types
there are sometimes called macro
parameters micro
parameters so the macro parameters are
big effects like uh
is it a head initial language or a head
final language
it seems to have a big effect is it a
polysynthetic language or analytic
language
on the other hand there are various if
you study
the people who study dialects in detail
people like say richard kane and others
they find tiny differences between
very closely related what we call
dialects actually languages
and these seem to vary all over the
place
so nobody knows how many of them there
are i mean
but they seem to be a different
character than the
macro parameters so probably the
you can guess reasonably the research
into parameters may divide up this way
and then of course the question arises
whether the macro parameters
are part of the externalization or part
of the course system
and there's a there's an interesting
debate about this so even the question
of
say linear order which i mentioned which
would have to do with
ordering parameters i i suggested the
other day that it's all externalization
but there's very good links to
like for chicane for example who argue
the opposite and they have good evidence
so
it's a it's a science not a religion you
know there's conflicts all
along the way and try to resolve
you do you emphasize that language is a
thought system
you're emphasized to say that language
is a thought
system yes would you
go so far and say that language is the
very reason
that human specific thinking is possible
i can't think of a coherent alternative
there's a lot of literature books coming
out all the time
articles uh claiming that there was that
language is a kind of a secondary
phenomenon thought came first
but nobody has ever given a proposal
as to what thought can be other than a
language
what else is thought i mean how do you
express how do you think a subject
predictive relation
unless you have a language-like system
and how do you think
an operator variable construction unless
you have
a language-like system so when you
eliminate the kind of hand-waving and
vacuous talk they claim that
thought-proceeded language is just the
claim that language preceded
externalization
so it comes back to the same thing if
you think of language as just being
externalization
well yeah it's probably true that
thought proceeded language but the
thought itself
is the language it's the real language
there's no alternative that i know of
and very kind of imagine to the idea
that thought is basically a
language-like system
now that doesn't mean that all thought
is in language of course it isn't
but the kind of thought that can be
expressed in language seems to be
language like
mr chomsky from your personal point of
view what is
the most powerful way to change the
world and to contribute to more peace
oh sorry i'm very sorry
um
actually my questions my question aims
to establish
a bound between the presentation
you made the past two days
and it is you were talking yesterday
about some a global democratic process
a what yes there's no no
yesterday you were talking about a
global democratic process that
are taking place nowadays now my
question
is um how a
could we see a language yes
and the possibilities of language
scientifically speaking
and its importance for a
global processes of social and political
transformation
well the language itself is kind of
irrelevant to this
so uh in a more democratic society you
speak the same language you do in a
totalitarian society
so it takes a modern germany which had
very
radical shifts up and back more than any
other modern society
so the 1920s you know maybe the peak of
western democracy
the 1930s the depths
dating the peak again but the language
didn't change
people spoke the same language uh the
way they used the language might have
changed that did change
but that's you that's use of language
it's not the
instrument itself and it's kind of like
uh
you know the language is kind of like a
tool let's say like a hammer
a hammer doesn't care whether it's used
to build a house or
to torture a prisoner as far as the
hammer is concerned it's irrelevant
and it can be used for anything and
i think the same is true of language i
mean there are some slight changes
but there must be changes in usage so
propaganda
for example modifies the
the use of language that makes up new
meanings for words for example
but these are really pretty superficial
things the language is
overwhelmingly the same no matter how
excused
so i don't really think there's a
connection some of my colleagues
disagree incidentally so this is my view
professor do we have a reasonable notion
about it i'm here yeah
do we have a reasonable notion about the
relation between
the lexicon and the computational system
in the beginning in the edomite
period and it's it's its emergence
later and the different weights
that the lexicon versus the
computational system
had in when growing up to our state of
the language faculty and you're
essentially talking about
evolution again well we're back in the
same morass
we don't know anything about evolution
uh the
uh it's it's it's hard to
you can all imagine almost any story
let's take
eve again this person who had the good
or
bad fortune depending on how you look at
it to have this
capacity to think she
there had to be some kind of units
around
you can't have a computational system
without
some kind of atoms of computation
and so she essentially something more or
less word like
maybe not words but something more or
less word like had to be around
but how much did there have to be well
we can't say
and the richness of meanings of words
it could have all been there in the
concepts whatever concept she had in
fact
almost again hard to think of an
alternative however
with the growth of the the appearance of
the capacity to produce
complex constructions it's very likely
that that led to lexical enrichment
in some fashion again using some sort of
innate capacities so at this point you
can
you can produce stories and all kinds of
but no evidence for anyone so i don't
think there's an answer
okay regarding the
two-step hypothesis um
do you would you would it make sense to
ask the
princess and innate grammar
also to that externalization process the
secondary process
or only to is there um
is there is this not innate at all
and we only have to consider the notion
of innate grammar
or the innate construction
regarding that constructive first step
possibly silent thought-related process
when
a language emerged and the second
question is
um what do you think about
the hypothesis but i think it's by
joseph reichhold the munich biologist
that multilingual
multiple languages occurred specifically
as a consequence that groups
would want not others to understand them
that specifically to bar the
understanding of honors
when groups would compete for resources
for example
yeah um the second part to the first pen
i forgot
do we have a written eight grammar for
music listening music for example
well okay there's several
questions um
first of all everything that we do is
based on something innate
the same with everything that an animal
does
so there's always some innate element i
mean
the word innate is a kind of a bad word
in some circles but
that's just confusion i mean no animal
down to bacteria just acts randomly
in all possible ways so they're somehow
constrained
and that's innate structure and of
course it's true of every aspect of
humans
grammar itself well the
initial i mean if the
scenario that i described as anywhere
near accurate
then the initial stage was totally
innate
it was a a wiring
neural wiring change mutation
which led to something new and out of
that comes some
cognitive system and there's no other
factors entering into how it comes
so that's totally the name then comes
the question what happened next
is it affected by uh further experience
by other genetic changes
it could have been many other genetic
changes they'd still be inadequate but
they
could be different and so on and there
we're entering into the world of
complete speculation there's no evidence
the variety of languages
plainly involves experience like i don't
speak swahili
okay if i'd grown up in kenya i would
so plainly there's no question that the
experience has an effect
and now our background question was
raised before uh does it
have an effect only on the
externalization
or to what extent does it affect the
core
grammar and semantics including meaning
of words
well there's a i think a reasonable
speculation
that it's externalization but not
certain by any means
but even in the externalization i mean
the
let's say the pronunciation the
morphology
the word or word order
everything in the externalization there
has to be innate factors
i mean otherwise in other words
incoherent you can't
acquire anything except in terms of
some restricted capacities that you have
i mean that's as old as aristotle
and it's plain to prove close to
logically true
that you've got to have some kind of
pre-existing structure in order to
acquire anything
so they're always going to be innate
elements soon the question is
what kind are there are there innate
elements specific to language
or are are there the innate elements
that enter into other forms of cognitive
development
the elements that enter into statistical
analysis
and so on and so forth and that's these
are just research problems
there's a little bit of evidence about
them but not a lot known
i mentioned i think i mentioned some the
other day
about detecting words
child detecting word-like elements from
running text so plenty of pretty early
development and it appears that it's
done by a mixture of
statistical analysis and
grammatical principles about prosody and
so on
well there's a few cases like that that
are understood and there
may be more but
it can't be that there's no innate
element that's impossible for
any kind of growth cognitive or other
the questions
second
the motives for developing different
languages probably many different kinds
of externalization
is preserving group identity and
separation from other groups
that's conceivable it's been suggested a
number of times there's
there's an important book by a generous
grammar
a very good one mark baker uh called
adams of language in which in the last
chapter he uh
he's studying for macro parameters
called micro parameters before like
polysynthesis and so on
and at the end of the book he has a
chapter i think
i don't know if it's tongue-in-cheek or
not but
he suggests that maybe different
macro parameters were chosen uh in order
to deceive others
so he uses it as an example
uh during the second world war
uh the us intelligence
used navajo speakers to communicate so
the germans wouldn't understand uh the
coding technique and he suggests that
maybe
this developed kind of the way it's yet
you mentioned well that's possible
again we have the slightest thing
there's no
evidence for it but it's a possibility
and
the last question is about music and
here there are some interesting
questions they go back to the origins of
evolutionary theory
so you go back to darwin and especially
wallace
alfred russell wallace the co-inventor
of
co-discoverer of natural selection that
wallace wrote
more than darwin about questions like
this
i don't think he mentioned the music but
he was interested in the fact that all
human beings
have a arithmetical capacity
how come volume that's another universal
human capacity
unique to humans we can
deal with numbers uh natural numbers
uh you know one two three they can
multiply
calculate and so on so where'd that come
from
and he pointed out that that's a kind of
a mystery because in
in human history that capacity was
virtually never
used it's only quite recently
in the last couple of thousand years
that there's any evidence the capacity
was used at all
and even then it's only used by a very
small number of people
by now a lot of people but until very
recently
almost nine so it couldn't have been
selected
so how did it get there well he
believed wallace believed and here he
had a big argument with darwin
his colleague essentially
wallace believed he had some other
principle besides natural selection
to account for the emergence of this
capacity
i think we can now see that that's not
the case that
very likely the numerical capacity just
piggybacked on language
if you take a look at the core
computational principles of language
and you simplify them very narrowly
you reduce the lexicon to one element
and let the principle of computation
function freely essentially get the
natural numbers
so it could have just been a
what's called an exception taking some
character characters that's already
there and using it for some other
purpose
uh the questions about it as always but
that's uh
that's a strong possibility well what
about music
uh music and dance
seem to be universal i don't think any
society has been found that doesn't have
something
like music it could be based on
different principles
like uh western music is tonal
other kinds of music or rhythmic but
there seems to be
it seems to be universal for humans
so we get the same question where did it
come from
and again one possibility is
that at least in part it's uh
it's building on language there are
structures and music that are
language-like
and they've been investigated
30 years ago i guess leonard bernstein
famous musician who gave a series of
lectures at harvard
based on this theme trying to show that
uh
he kept the western
the western canon you know tunnel-based
music
and tried to show that its structure and
character
it could have been derived from language
since then there's
a lot of work on the topic pro and con
so that's a possibility and if that's
not
the core then you gotta search for some
other source
it does appear to be a genetic
human capacity it's unknown among other
organisms
you do get things a little like it
mainly in songbirds
songbirds do have something
superficially it looks a little bit like
music and
but it's very different character
actually there's quite good work on this
by uh
his name scientist i think at utrecht
worked on it uh could pick up the name
but so it's a bit different you know but
nevertheless
of someone rough similarities but you
know songbird
evolutionarily extremely remote from
humans
if anything it's some kind of
convergence it's not an evolutionary
source
we're up in the air as with most
questions about evolution
i think i may have mentioned the other
day that very simple questions of
evolution
are understood to be so complex that
nobody even looks
the evolution of communication system of
bees
there's about 500 species of bees
some of them have quite complex
communication systems
different traditions sort of broke this
open
uh some of them have no communication
system at all that anybody can detect
and they make out of that as well as the
ones that have
waggle dance and so on so it raises the
question of what it's all for
um but anyway they're they're different
lots of different systems
so you get a lot of comparative evidence
of these of course
tiny organisms i think the
the brain is about the size of a grass
seed
so you can do much it's much easier to
study than
complex mammals you can do any kind of
experiment you like
you know the bees don't have the sun
consent forms and so on so
that anything all kinds of
experimentation are possible they have
very short
gestation periods i think a couple of
days so you can breed them
essentially everything's open but
nothing's known
it's a it's a hard problem and science
isn't easy
uh and studying something which looks as
simple as evolution of b
communication is so difficult that
there's almost nothing in the literature
about it
and not that people haven't thought
about it they just understand you can't
do much
uh when you get the is it kind of a
paradox that
there are libraries full of books on
evolution of language human language
which is an incomparably more difficult
question
and almost nothing on the evolution of b
language
it's a kind of a pathology of human
culture
that people can't see that they're
trying to study something that's way out
of sight
when you can't even study much simpler
cases
you can ask why that goes on but it
certainly does you go to the library you
can check it out pretty quickly
but yeah the questions you raise are
certainly significant ones
like where does music come from why does
it have the few forms that it does
how come
humans can pick up children can pick up
a musical style
so simply actually this pretty
remarkable
evidence on this you may some of you may
know the study of
a girl who was called genie g
and ie that called her she was
this is a girl who's uh who was put into
a he was locked into a room
when she was about i think about two
years old
you know raised parents and she was kept
in almost in total isolation
she was found when she was about 12 and
of course released and treated and so on
but she went from
two to twelve roughly that without
any human contact didn't hear nobody
spoke to her her father pushed
food under the door and she could pick
it up i think she was tied to a chair in
fact
but when they finally kind of found her
and tried to
you know save her somehow it turned out
she was very smart
she could figure things she learned very
quickly and learned pretty complicated
things
and she was also apparently very
personable so everybody liked it
so and the experiment at first fooled
themselves
into thinking that she was acquiring
language
she was able to act in ways which made
it look like she was acquiring language
but
closer investigation should she really
didn't however
she did know musical styles
she was probably hearing something you
know through the window or somewhere
uh very but it turned out that she
obviously was
psychologically you know a total mess
but the psychologist who's taking care
of her very good person for
susan curtis who happened to be a
pianist
and she uh discovered that she could
calm jeannie down
if she was upset by playing certain
styles of music
specific styles i think romanian folk
songs or something
she obviously identified those styles
and they meant something to
it so with almost minimal experience she
had
acquired an understanding of musical
dramas
well fortunately there's not a lot of
cases like this but
where it really exists it turns out that
musical styles apparently can be
acquired extremely
fast kind of like language uh
that must mean that we anticipate events
anyhow that there's very sharp
genetic restrictions which come from
somewhere
you pointed out that thought is a
language-based system
and but you always also said that it
never can be proved
it only can be something
some hints on it and did you ever think
about what might be your reputation for
that
assumption well a refutation would first
of all have to be some alternative
hypothesis
and at the moment there's no alternative
hypothesis
now you can only uh investigate the
correctness of some hypothesis if
there's an alternative to compare it
with
and i don't know
i would like um now to allow a question
from the
rc are there questions in llc
yes thank you i cannot listen
okay yeah thanks a lot um
i would like to come back to the attempt
to
interconnect first of all yeah
linguistics
we're not talking about uh at the moment
and
yeah political questions and i do not
agree or
i have another estimation that
that linguistics or language has
an important impact on the way human
behave and also yeah on social relations
so my question would be you just
mentioned that
structures in music are also based on
language
but are the structures in human
relations
also based on language art languages
and the way language is expressed
well human relations are certainly based
on the way language is expressed
i mean that's not even controversial but
the
scientific question is a different one
is
the way in which language use influences
thought does that reflect differences in
characteristics of the language itself
or is it kind of like a hammer you can
like i said
torture can use it a carpenter can use
it
so is language like that
or is it somehow the structure and
nature of language
that influences human uh behavior
as far as i know there's no evidence
that it does
and there's pretty strong evidence that
it doesn't the history of germany which
i mentioned is a pretty good example
the german the language german didn't
change in any relevant way from
the 1920s to today but the
human behavior certainly changed
radically in fact about as radical as
anything in modern history and there's
many other examples like that so
if somebody it's a very common view even
among scientific linguists and
anthropologists
particularly sociologists what you
express
but it's extremely hard to think of any
evidence where
though of course language use
transparently
uh relates in all sorts of ways that
human relations
is
great questions about uh linguistics in
general
uh one more general and the other one a
bit more technical um the general
question
is uh so in linguistics you easily get
the impression
that uh everything is still up for grabs
and things come and go
uh what do you think are the main
insights that
generative grammar has
so far in the past 50 years um so
i have in mind
so what do you think are the main
technical uh insights that the program
has has
brought up so far and the second a bit
more technical question is
you mentioned in your lecture the case
of
illicit extractions uh lh
expressions or whatever
what you said was that in all these
cases we have the
intuition or the impression that these
illicit sentences expressed is still a
coherent thought
and your conclusion was that that
indicates that there's something called
externalization
again involved here and as you know
research on ellipses and someone thinks
the same thing that
externalization plays a role there
and i would just like to know if you
have any
thoughts about why that might be that is
why might the externalization system
care about
things like islands
well first of all
the first question is a good question
but it would require a complex answer
in fact just the answer would be given
by comparing what was taught about
language say in the
1950s with what's thought about language
today
it's very different so go back to the
1950s it was the earliest
steps in trying to construct generative
grammar actually the late 40s
had phrased structure grammars of
transformational grammars that both
very complex a lot of interest you see
that seemed to be necessary to just
yield minimal descriptive adequacy
uh all of that almost all of that has
been
eliminated so phrase structure grammar
which is an extremely complex
system with lots of stipulations now
that's been
in modern degenerative grammar that's
been eliminated totally no
residue of uh transformational grammars
were
had pretty complex structures in the
1950s
later on as you know very well they were
reduced to
they were successful reductions to much
simpler
principles like ultimately say move
anything anywhere
a major discovery of the late 90s
is that the two of what's left of the
two systems can be combined
under single operation which furthermore
is the simplest possible computational
operation
that's merged it was recognized
should have been recognized much earlier
but it wasn't
that merge alone gives you the rudiments
of both systems
and does it in a fashion which
is adapted to thought systems but
maladapted to speech systems which is
part of the reason for
thinking that there is this dichotomy
that i mentioned
uh the shift from the early
approaches 50s and 60s the conception
of universal grammar was that it
provided
a format for grammars
so just here's the kind of system the
grammar is
but it permitted an infinite number of
them
okay therefore it had to be supplemented
by
some procedure it's called an evaluation
procedure which would pick
one or another given data we have to
account for language acquisition
so the idea was the child is just
approaching language acquisition
with the understanding that
this is the format that the language has
to be satisfied
but they're an infinite number of
possibilities and therefore use some
procedure
to select among them well that's the
general problem that's called abduction
in the philosophy of science it goes
back to charles sanders purse
and it's known to be unsolvable that
scientists somehow do it but by a
mysterious process that nobody
understands
but the child has to have a way of doing
it
and what's the way well that was a
real difficulty that difficulty was
resolved by kind of cutting the gordian
knot
and that's the principles and parameters
program around
1980 that which allows only a finite
number of choices
so from that point of view the
acquisition process is
kind of like ask answering a
questionnaire here's a
finite number of questions a child has
to answer each one of them
when each one's answered you get the
language well that's
that's a huge change then comes a very
rich
period of extensive research i think
there's no doubt that
more has been learned about language
since around 1980 than
the entire several thousand years of
history of linguistic research
it was a very productive research
program
that does have all kind of problems like
the ones i mentioned
uh or all of the texas case
the the which you mentioned uh it was
kind of striking but
in all of the history of study of
language
there was never really any recognition
it was implicit understanding but never
explicit recognition
of the was a pretty simple fact namely
that there's a difference between an
inherent json structural case
inherent cases you know like
ablative and latin has a particular
meaning
the structural cases like is nominative
and accusative or
ergotive and absolute which have no
meaning at all
they just depend on the structural
position
there's a pretty sharp difference but if
you take really classic
studies like roman jakobson as a cause
of slayer of one of the
major achievements of structural
linguistics
he doesn't make any distinction he tries
to find a meaning
for a nominative case an accusative case
didn't mention it he would have tried it
if an absolute
and that's just false well that
distinction was really
recognized in the 70s by george
in a famous letter which is now well
known in which he
made the distinction and drew many
consequences from it
well that
in part what he was arguing was that
every language has the same k system
in the internal language it's
externalized differently
so in say latin and english you
externalize it
very differently in english not at all
but it's the same internally and he
argued that the consequences of
the the structural case system in
particular has
certain consequences and those
consequences are found even if you know
articulate
it's a little bit like a wh movement
say in chinese you don't see it but it
seems to have the same consequences
uh the well that's very neo's
case theory around 1980
pretty well known and since then there's
a ton of
inquiry into it you know just how does
it work it's a
plausible theory can you sustain it in
the face of
apparent counter examples finnish
icelandic
look quite different can you work it
into the same system and so on
so that's a rich area but all of this is
quite considerable progress i mean
nobody
in their right minds anyway teaches
the study of language the way it did in
the 1950s
or the 60s out of the 80s to all of that
as progress
inherent in the core computational
system
so takes a locality uh there's been
a lot of investigation of locality so
for example the
luigi greet seeds relativized minimality
or
it's the core notion and contemporary
gender of grammar
that could well be what i was calling a
third factor principle
which is a principle of natural law
uh principle of minimal computation
i mean a fair assumption and by now
reasonably well and supported is that
since language is a computational system
it's going to satisfy
the general properties of computational
systems
one of which will be minimal computation
do as little computations you can
okay and in fact if you have locality
principles
it does reduce the computation
extensively
so it's quite possible that locality
principles are just
just come from the fact that uh the
languages and naturals
is a system of the natural world uh
that's a possibility and i think it's
probably true
probably has nothing to do with
externalization on the other hand there
are
there are cases where you get
constraints and properties of
performance
that this is the other extreme
properties of performance that
do involve other systems others is
like memory okay so for example about
50 years ago a george miller
psychologist and i
uh did some studies of uh
perform embed performance embedding
if you have embedded structures like
structures like if-then constructions or
the men are but not the men is things
where there are long distance
dependencies
which can be embedded inside each other
and you can get indefinite
constructive bounding well it turns out
that
humans can't process these
when they go beyond about seven you can
push it hard if you push it hard you can
construct
a sentence of about seven levels of
embedding which are
reasonably intelligible well there's a
reason why
and it comes out of george miller's work
on short-term memory
this famous paper of his in the 1950s
called the magic number seven
plus or minus two uh then the
the discovery was that
apparently across
you know a wide range of animals
including humans
the short-term memory has about seven
options
for birds maybe five
some other organisms six but somewhere
in that range
maybe some humans can maybe go up to
eight or something
but there is a short-term memory
limitation and that would account for
the
performance of this aspect of
performance
well that's a restriction it's not so
much
on externalization if you like but it's
coming from something else
it's coming from the structure of memory
now there's another discovery which is
much more interesting
we also have it in the same paper and
that is if you have
self-embedding that is you put a
you have an agreement relation like a
plural plural noun a plural verb if you
have an agreement relation you embed it
in another
agreement relation where you have a if
then construction you put it inside
another
then construction then the bound
on performance reduces sharply
in fact you can barely get to three
three
people just can't understand it when you
get to
two you can manage but three is almost
impossible you have to really
think about it or write it down or
something like that
so for itself and betty there's much an
hour of a restriction
now that can't come from short-term
memory it's the same
short-term memory consideration so
there's got to be some other reason for
that
and we suggest it's still a research
question but
one thing we suggested is that
in processing a sentence it's sort of
like a
you working kind of like a computer
program
at each point you're calling it a sub
routine
so this kind of sub routine saying okay
i'm now in an
agreement problem around now and if then
problem
and it could turn out that when you're
executing a sub-routine you can't call
on the same sub-routine
if that's the case you would get
self-embedding maybe up to level two so
it couldn't be the answer
but it could be some other answer but
those are cases where
other factors enter into performance
which are not part of the linguistic
system
what about islands of the kind i
mentioned
the other day ecp
how many mechanics do you wonder if
fixed the cars now it turns out if you
look at other languages
uh say italian you have sentences just
like that
well this looked like a problem about 30
years ago
and we now have the standard separation
of linguistics from the natural sciences
unfortunately as i mentioned the other
day
in the natural sciences typically when
you get something that looks like
contradiction of a principle
you don't throw away the principles you
try to find the reasons for the
apparent difference the classic example
which i mentioned is the
perturbations in the uh and the orbits
and the orbit of uranus that was
noticed actually i think or maybe as far
back as galileo but it was noticed
but the scientists didn't throw out
kepler's laws
and newton's laws what they did was
search for some
reason for the perturbation and sooner
or later they found neptune
same problem rose with neptune and found
pluto
but in the study of language
it's kind of like a drive to throw out
everything
so if you find something that doesn't
work it's helpful throughout everything
now that goes on all the time a lot of
contemporary papers about it
it's totally irrational but it's a
driving
force in the human sciences uh
unfortunately well in this case
the exception to ecp as you know pretty
well
uh the luigi reed i think about 30 years
ago
and pointed out that in null subject
languages
language we don't have to express the
subject but there's another question
there's another position for the subject
post-verbal position and the extraction
could be coming and probably is coming
from the post-verbal position
so it's not violating the principle
that's adhering to the principle
well that's the right kind of answer
when you get a
counter example that doesn't
work automatically to the problem
well if that turns out to be the right
way to go then ecp really is universal
and then comes the question why is it
there is it an externalization
question or is it just something about
uh minimal computation
and there's proposal can i have a
proposal
uh nothing's in print even but i think i
mentioned it in class
last fall he's uh incidentally he knows
what he's talking about
but uh you were there
i think i talked about trying to deduce
ecp from inheritance of
features from seated team okay if that
works
it would be a kind of a minimalist
computational answer to
why the principle is there again
minimizing computation
and it wouldn't be in the
externalization system
but these are always just open questions
some of them may be in performance like
adam sag has argued that
subjective restrictions or performance
restrictions
maybe the what's called superiority
violations actually because years ago
research on it it could turn out to be
and not it could turn out to be that
superiority isn't a real
issue it's a it's a matter of uh focal
stress
uh it looks like that might be true same
would be true for
quantifier reversal you know someone saw
everyone
shigeru miyagawas so you really have to
just look at the particular cases and
try to figure out what the answer is i
mean it's never said but
so um think we can go in the discussion
now also
to the topic of the second lecture
although it's fascinating for me as
uh yeah being not a linguist
to follow up this kind of discussions
extremely
interesting so maybe um we did also
here the audience with urban airport in
the honor see
the first question the next session
already
yeah and then he moved here back to the
seminar room and maybe we go back at the
end
so one question does it here
in reference to the case you talked
about
with jenny and our question concerning
language acquisition
and what i want to know is do you think
that language acquisition is really
restricted to a certain age
or that is depending on requiring
any parameter or setting any parameters
to learn english languages or at least
them all the time
so is language acquisition kind of age
restricted
there's uh almost ever any innate
capacity that we know of
that has what's called a critical period
this actually was studied first by great
pathologist conrad lawrence back a long
time ago
and it turns out to be pretty universal
that
if there's an eight capacity there's a
certain period at which it has to
be implemented usually by stimulation
so it takes a the capacity for visual
perception
recognition of objects uh the
visual system i mean now the neurology
of this is very well understood again
from experimentation with
cats and monkeys but it's all
inside you know the neurology is
constructed so that you
see the lines angles of
rigid objects and so on
however famous experiments by if you go
and be soft about
1960 it turns out that if you
deprive a kitten of pattern stimulation
pattern visual stimulation in the first
couple of weeks of life then the neural
systems degenerate
and can be reconstructed the kidney
blinds essentially
so it's an innate system but it has to
be stimulated
and it has to have a particular kind of
stimulation
if the kidneys say gets diffused light
then it doesn't get stimulated has to be
patterned
in effect the nature of the patterns
like how many
horizontal lines are there and so on
that's going to affect
the neurology of the system and the way
the kidneys see
that's the norm for for all biological
systems
and it's presumably the norm for
language too
now as i've said and it is obvious you
can't experiment the same way with
humans
so you don't raise children in
controlled environments to see if
they won't develop languages
there's no direct experimentation
there's no other organisms you can't do
comparative work
so you have to use very indirect
evidence but the indirect evidence
indicates something that most of us know
from experience
there is a period when language
acquisition is
almost reflexive the child can't help
learning the language it just comes like
growing growing arms and that seems to
be
to change typically around puberty
post-puberty it's generally much harder
to acquire
a language natively people can still
learn languages but they
typically kind of tack them on to their
their own language so you're kind of
learning it more or less by
translation and things like
pronunciation many people just can't do
it all
now there are individual differences so
there are some people who manage to pick
up
their languages like children for
whatever reason maybe they're
immature or something like that but
actually we had a joke in my department
at mit
it was i'm about the worst possible
language learner there is but there was
one person in the department ken hale a
great linguist who
learned language like a child go
somewhere
a couple of weeks he's talking the
language we used to
kid him about being immature
anyhow that that difference is pretty
steady that by now it's known that there
are other
critical periods that also make a
difference there's one apparently
around six or so and there is some
evidence it's
actually this work that my wife did
mostly on
helen keller type cases you know cases
of deafblind
who do learn language the way i
mentioned with facial
but this kind of information minimal
information
that's the way helen keller learned but
she got very fluent
but timeless tiny amount of information
well the studies of these people
apparently show that
around there's a critical period around
maybe 18
months something around that age and if
the child has become deaf-blind
usually a result of spinal meningitis
it loses sight and hearing before
that age it'll never acquire language
you can't use the method of teaching
if it if the disease comes
around that time or later then
the method of teaching works if you take
the famous case on keller that's
her case because i think about 20 months
and now fortunately you can't
investigate this anymore
because spinal meningitis is untreatable
so you don't have any more cases
but uh the cases that did exist it's a
scattering seem to break up that way
that has very remarkable implications if
you think it through
what it seems to imply is that by about
18 months the child already knows the
whole language
and that what's coming after that is
just eliciting the internal knowledge
now those of you no 18 month old
children no they don't
exhibit any knowledge of language
virtually nothing
maybe say a word two but apparently it's
all going on in there
and they've acquired their native
language
uh then it can get elicited well if
that's the case there's a very sharp
critical period
uh there's more evidence about this
that's
coming coming through it turns out
as experimentation techniques become
better and better
it turns out that you can push the
age at which something's acquired lower
and lower
it's by now pretty well established
that there's intrauterine learning that
inside the uterus the child is already
picking up
something about the native language and
it's known by
say experimentation with cows you know
you stick a
stick a hearing device on the uterus
that if you listen to what you're
getting you get kind of muffled speech
so presumably the infant is getting the
same thing
and by the time the child is born it can
already
distinguish the language of its mother
from another language both spoken by a
bilingual woman whose voice it's never
heard and experiments are well done
but that means as soon as that was
discovered immediately that
said awful lot of research on what
differences
what kind of distinctions are made and
it turns out it's not
any two languages it depends on the
exotic structure of the language the
rhythm
pitch pitch contours things like that
if languages differ in those structures
then the child the infant the newborn
infant can distinguish them
if they're more or less the same in
those structures it can't distinguish
them so apparently that's what the
infant is picking up by now there's a
little
known about the neurological basis
apparently this work by
uh excellent cognitive neuroscientist
laura ann petitto and it's now toronto
who appears to have found that
i don't think this is published yet but
she seems to have found
a part of an identifiable part of the
human brain
which doesn't exist in other animals
that
responds to certain rhythmic
properties and interestingly they're at
about
syllable length roughly syllable length
and it turns out that the infant this
piece of the brain
is kind of searching the environment to
find
structures of that kind they can be
sound
or they could be touch or color almost
anything
as long as anything has that kind of
rhythmic property
this piece of the brain is stimulated
and starts acting
well that kind of suggests that that's
what's going on
uh prenatally intrauterine
and by now it's pretty well known that
by
say about six months the child has
already acquired most of the prosodic
system of the language
and by about say 10 months roughly the
child has acquired the
basic phonetic distinctions so if you're
say a japanese child
and you haven't had evidence about
say the r l distinction uh it'll
never acquire they'll have to learn it
in some other way
because that capacity is gone and
there's considerable work of this kind
also in other cognitive domains
for those of you who've studied psja's
work and who will
know the very important work that he he
proposed stages of development cognitive
development
well there's been a lot of research into
that since and it turns out that
probably none of them exist if you do
the experiments properly you can
show that as early as you can test uh
the children are
making the distinctions you just have
it's harder to do experiments with
one-year-olds and
six-year-olds but but if
you do a sophisticated way it's
different
so these are these are very rich
research areas there's a lot to discover
there but the general picture
seems to be that by and large
language observes the same kind of
developmental processes in particular
the variety of critical periods that you
find with
other capacities and so with humans
let's say
that the same is true simply walking i
mean if a child is for one reason or
another has to be kept instilled
uh as an infidel so he can't walk you
know
and then if it's a cured of whatever the
problem is
two years off old probably can't learn
to walk
you just have to stimulate these things
at the right age
but the same is also not just about
social interaction
i mean it's well known that in
orphanages where children may be
physically cared for perfectly well you
know they're fed and so on but they
don't have
normal human interaction they're just
permanently stunted cognitively all
kinds of cognitive development
doesn't perceive in fact it's even known
now
this recent work very good
neuroscientist helen neville has done
recent studies on
cognitive differences between depending
on socioeconomic level
so in poorer richer families and it's
well known that there are cognitive
differences
but she's discovered that there are
neural differences
and tests as she proceeded further
she found that a lot of this just
depends on
how the parents talk to the children so
if you have a
culture usually lower socioeconomic
levels
where the parents don't talk to the
children they just yell at them
you know shut up or get out of the house
or something like that
then the children have sort of normal
language but they don't have normal
cognitive development
and it works um as therapeutically like
if she's
of course trying to figure out can you
cure it and if it turns out
if you have kind of family training you
know you kind of
train the parents to talk to the
children the way
the middle upperclass educated people
talk to their children you know read
them stories and
interact with them and so on then the
cognitive difficulties
are considerably overcome
so there's something going on if you
like a long enough
permanent deficiency but there are
all kinds of differences of stimulation
which affect
neural development and cognitive
development uh
language is a case in point it seems to
work like others
yes
um as a stubborn sensation i very much
like this
strep structure preserving principles
and and i uh structure preserving
friends
and i i somehow i was wondering um i
i could not see it in the face theory i
missed
i missed the structure preserving
principle in your face theory
phase theory correct me if i'm wrong
yeah
well i it doesn't i mean the structural
preserving principle is obviously there
you know to see it all over the place it
shows up in the peripheral case that i
mentioned say auxiliary
they're all over the place why i don't
think it has to do with phases
the only good explanation i can think of
i know of is the one i mentioned that
linear order just is not available
uh it's simply unavailable to the
computational system
meaning it comes from externalization so
it's plainly there in externalization
but that could well be just a reflex
sensory motor system
and we don't talk in parallel you have
to talk in sequence
so the sensory motor system is imposing
the requirements that you have some kind
of order and incidentally can be
different kinds
so in sign it's quite different in sign
you do do things in parallel so
say in american sign language to ask a
question
it's just a declarative assertion but
you know you raise your eyebrows through
the
whole question okay that's
parallel or speaking you know
produced but something various kinds of
organizations are opposed by the
sensory motor system and it could be
that linear order is one of them
in which case structure preserving is
just minimal computation
period uh there's no alternative
and i i mentioned the other day some
neurological evidence
turns out to say it again that uh
there's some evidence now from the group
and milan that
if you try to teach people what from
their point of view or nonsense
languages
if they satisfy universal grammar
principles then
the broca's area the language area is
activated
but if you try to teach them something
that involves linear order
like negate a sentence by putting the
negative particle after the third word
very trivial computational thing and
they can
solve it but they're not using broken
theory
they're using other parts of the brain
so they're reflexively treating it as a
puzzle
not a language this kind of evidence is
accumulating but there's also counter
evidence
richard kane's work which i mentioned is
a very significant work
he argues quite strongly that
linear order has to be in the core
component so you just have
the usual contradictions that you find
in science as evidence
pointing opposite
hello um i know um i'd like to thank you
for being here
but more importantly i'd like to thank
you for serving as an example
not just for me but for for many people
the way you
conduct yourself the way you live your
life
uh i have a question i
am a teacher at a university i try to
conduct my classes
according to anarchist principles
usually i don't say it
because the one word that's about to
shock people is
the word anarchist or anarchy
um but i'm wondering if you think that
education can become more
effective through a reduction in
hierarchy
at schools and universities and i have a
practical question
i found a summer school for kids
uh it's also run on anarchist principles
but
i was very careful not to include the
word
anarchist in the title of the school
behind your school
i don't think that's why do you think we
can ever recover
uh the the true meaning of this word
or has it been has been to pollute
the popular consciousness
it's possible that it's been too
polluted but that's true of just about
every word of
political discourse so in the united
states for example the word liberal
is unpronounceable
progressive pure liberal years
but and even to the extent that liberal
is used
it's used in the way which is opposite
to its meaning
so you go back to classical liberalism
it's what's now called conservatism
democratic but you can't use the term uh
capitalism is
unusable actually one of the most
interesting cases
in the united states it's all over the
media and
congress and everything else you see it
everywhere
there's an obscene word in english and
so i've seen
that i can't say it you know maybe there
are
children listening it's called spell it
it's about
p-r-o-f-i-t-s
that's unpronounceable it's obscene
but there's a way of pronouncing it it's
called jobs
so when you hear the president or a
congressman saying
we've got to do such and such like
reduce taxes on
corporations because we have to get more
jobs
what they mean is we have to get more
profits but you can't say that
so yes anarchism has been poisoned but
so of most words
that's part of political propaganda on
the other hand the principle that you
mentioned correctly
eliminating hierarchy illegitimate
hierarchy
i think that's as natural as learning
language
i think everybody agrees with that if
it's presented that way
yes why should we have illegitimate
authority
is there some kind of hierarchy
structure or some structure of authority
and domination
it's not self-chest design it has to
justify itself
if it can't it should be dismantled and
sometimes it can't
take teaching a teacher's
part of the duty of the most open-minded
anarchist teacher is going to be to
structure
what the child is acquiring in some
fashion
actually there's a kind of classic
description of this
who was one of them you probably know
one of the founders of
the modern education higher educational
system was a
one of the founders of classical
liberalism that he
suggested that the image that they used
was
that education shouldn't be thought of
as
pouring like pouring water into a vessel
but it should be thought of as laying
out a string
along which the learner proceeds in his
or her own way
creatively but with some kind of
structure well i think that kind of
authority can be justified
uh it's real with his authority but
pouring water into a vessel i don't
think can be just about
and can this work sure it can work
i mean any decent say
graduate and any decent education
sciences
that tries to achieve that maybe fails
for these
trials so when you're there's one
great physicist uh one meeting 20th
century physicist
victor weiskopf who taught freshman
courses at mit as most of the senior
faculty does
and he was famous because
in the freshman course first of course
students would ask him
what are we going to cover in this
course and his standard answer is
it doesn't matter what we cover it
matters what you discover
that's what we're doing here you're
going to discover things
and if the student challenges what the
professor is saying that's good that's
what you encourage in fact a lot of
innovation comes
along that way that most of us
experience this
in graduate courses often uh somebody
says i don't believe that that's wrong i
have
another way of doing it that's fine
that's what you encourage talking right
it's the way a lot of the
progress takes place and that can go on
at the kindergarten level too
i luckily for me i have to experience it
i was in a dewey
school is a john dewey style school
which is kind of run along these lines
from
actually before i go about 18 months old
because my parents were working because
i was in
nursing school up until uh until i got
to high school
at age 12. and it was a very
free open place a lot of creative work a
lot of cooperative work
nobody was created no it wasn't until i
got to high school that i knew it was a
good student because the question never
came up
as soon as you get to high school you
know your a or b you ranked the third in
the class whatever it may be
a totally different system and
i mean i knew that i had everyone knew
that i'd skipped a class
but all that that meant was i was the
smallest kid in the class
no nothing no other conclusions were
drawn from it either by me
or anyone else and in high school it's
all different
ranking coercion i can remember
what went on in my childhood school
very well i can't remember anything from
high school it's like a black hole
i knew i got through it and she did a
scholarship to college so
something must have worked but i don't
know what it was that was
pouring the water into a vessel and
ranking
people and how well they churned out the
water
so sure you can do it from kindergarten
on through graduate school
and i think you can be done very
successfully pretty much along
on both lines you
kind of there's some organized structure
but then
the student has to figure out their own
way
to work through it maybe original ways
they're working together with others
with no real direction at all
i mean you give exams but those are only
for
measures of progress doesn't matter how
they come out
the actual systems that are in place are
quite different
i don't know how it works here but in
the united states at least
the educational system is
from kindergarten updates moving towards
training for the marine corps
consequent tests i mean i've had talked
to teachers
and tell me complaining about this a
couple weeks ago i spoke to a sixth
grade teacher kids about
eight or nine or so she told me that
they were talking about something in
class
and some little girl came up to her
after class and
said she was really interested in this
how could she pursue it more
and the teacher had to tell her you
can't do it
because you have to study for this exam
and if you don't pass the exam
you're going to be in trouble and i'm
going to be in trouble because the
teachers are great
are graded on how well they how well the
kids do in the exams
like how much water they've poured into
the vessel well
i'm sure you've all had the experience
of
studying for an exam you know learning
everything
doing perfect and the two days later you
forgot what the subject was
that's that's what it's like if you
force it
if you force training for people and
that's the way the system is moving
and as i say even teachers are being
graded on it so they're kind of
compelled to do it they'll
lose their jobs and cut some salary if
they don't we're enough water
that's a very destructive form of
education but
anarchy style education called that
that works extremely well
but i'm here
dear mr chomsky i got a more
personal maybe also a bit naive question
for you
you deal mostly with political topics
and problems
which are pretty depressing and sad
to deal with from the politics of your
country
to the general general state of the
world
and its people i also experienced that
in my studies
um now my question is um how does that
personally affect you and uh
and what is it that that keeps you going
on and
dealing with all of this without turning
cynic or depressed
i mean how it affects me what is my wife
not me but the uh
how many deal with the depression
problems because those are the problems
you know you can talk about how
wonderful
something is but you know who cares
trying to improve to change some sorts
of problems
so from a certain point of view it's
depressing it's not necessarily
depressing
you look over a period of time and
there's considerable progress
things change change for the better very
often
so the
lifetime of most of you say from the
1960s up till today roughly then
there's been a lot of progress i
don't know anything about this
university but i suspect it's the same
as
the ones i do know about it's like my
own
say mit that when i got the monkey in
the 1950s
it was very different from the way it is
today
in the 1950s it was almost entirely
white males well-dressed
the hierarchy personal relations
the style of dress reflects human
relations
uh no political activity people working
on the problems that
they had to work on laser-like intensity
over the years have changed look at it
today
it kind of looks like this it's about
half women
about a third minorities
informal dress which reflects informal
relations
a lot of interaction in fact with
student interaction
a lot of political activity of all kinds
uh well that's a big visit and that's
happened everywhere
it's a big change that came about mainly
from the 60s activism and what followed
a lot of it is what followed so the
feminist movement
probably had more impact on social
on society than anything else and it's
mostly from the 70s
that the environmental movement was you
know 90s
the anti-nuclear movement was the 80s
global justice movements now big
those are very recent decades
so there are there's plenty of progress
and there's regression also
so there's both but you can celebrate
the progress but
knowledge point to it the important
thing is to look at the
existing problems and regression and to
do something about them
as to how you feel about it that's kind
of irrelevant you can
it's a personal personal matter
but all you can do is
pursue a kind of pascal's wager
that you can decide to be pessimistic
and depressed
and not do anything and in that case you
ensure
that the worst happens where you can
choose to be
optimistic and look forward and try to
do what you can and you may be able to
improve things
well it's not much of a choice so
i don't think there's anything to say
about that
just make your choices
my question is concerning the arab world
and the arab spring
what are the tasks the other people
should immediately do
in order to fight against internal
and external forces that uh try
anything uh to stop the democratization
of the region
they don't want to read change in the
most important region
of the world you said yesterday they are
it is a very important region they won't
don't want to lose
the control on resources what can
the other people do about this
and do exactly what they're doing um
there are very
they're very dramatic developments in
the arab world in the last just in the
last few months
very successful once in fact and they've
won
considerable successes like in egypt
which is
the most important country it has had
the most progress
but they haven't overthrown the
traditional regime
the military are still in charge but the
protesters are still at it uh big
protests
every friday tucker square and so on and
they're now confronting the military for
the first time
uh before this the protests were mostly
uh
applauding the military because the
military were had had turned
against the dictatorship
but now the military's back is back in
control
and is trying to as torture going on
imprisonment to imposing restrictions
and
the protesters haven't given up by any
means
uh the fear from that region you know
better than i do
they're going ahead and they've already
won some significant
uh they've had some significant
achievements they've pressed in egypt
for
general tunisia also is much more free
than it was before
before was mostly state press not worth
looking at
now at the ala major journal it's really
worth reading
it's a free open independent journal
more so than ours i think uh
the crucial part is labor organizing
the labor there's a very been a very
militant labor movement in egypt for
a long time a constant struggles with
some
victories a lot of repression and
violence
but now they're organizing freely and in
fact going pretty far
there are some cases where a
worker managed worker owned and managed
the industrial complexes are beginning
to function
that's way beyond us so they're uh
they're moving ahead meeting a lot of
repression
as i mentioned the west is totally
opposed
doing everything it can to keep the old
regimes in place
that's to be expected also to be
expected is they'll claim the opposite
they'll claim their love of democracy
and freedom
disregard what political leaders and
you know intellectual leaders say forget
about them
but what they're doing is trying to
repress it and constrain it it's
perfectly understandable
that they understand perfectly well that
if our public opinion
were to begin to influence policy that
the west would be in real trouble
that gave us some of the reasons
yesterday i guess
sam again if you want uh so that's going
to continue
what can we do well we're not
you know you and i we're not in copper
square we're here
but we can influence our own governments
they are the ones who are trying to
repress democracy and freedom
that we we don't face torture chambers
military and so on we little a lot more
freedom and options than
the egyptians tunisians syrians and
others do and we can use it
we can use it to influence our own
governments so that they'll
at least tolerate uh moves towards
freedom and democracy maybe even support
that can be done too so there's no
shortage of things to do
this shortage of will to do them
um i would like to give a question
i would like to give the opportunity
for question here from the origin
started
professor chomsky um thanks for being
here my question is this
i think it was
bertrand russell who once described
the human instincts and i don't have to
accept quote but
enemies of reason
and justice another way
in other words it will always lead to
confusion
through prejudice and racism
on the other hand we have you talking
about the creativity
that is involved in every um
act of using language and
in your debate with you talked about the
creativity
as a fundamental human characteristic
so do you think there is
a possibility to be much more optimistic
about human nature
well um russell the person i
respect a lot in fact the only person
who's
portrayed as pictures on the wall in my
office but
uh he was repeating something that's
familiar and in part true there are
parts of human nature are very
regressive
that's why you get oppression violence
uh
torture and it's all part of human
nature
on the other hand other parts of human
nature are
quite different striving for freedom
overcoming authority striving for
justice
it's all part of human nature it's all
instincts if you like there's a range of
instinctive behavior that humans have
and the
appropriate task is to cultivate the
the ones that are benevolent
and suppress the ones that are harmful
that's
what life is about and there's been as i
mentioned there's been plenty of
progress
the things that were taken for granted
not very long ago
are considered intolerable today and
take another example take a
homosexuality
take britain and the united states and
very free societies
in the united states until about 1960
it was criminal in britain
um it was a famous case which
illustrates that one of the great
mathematicians of the 20th century alan
turing
who also helped save the britain from
destruction during the second world war
he was one of the people who decoded the
german codes which enabled
britain to survive the bombings and so
on so he's a
national hero also one of the
the sort of founder of modern computer
theory
that he was homosexual in the early
1950s
the british government essentially
murdered him
they didn't call it murder but what they
did was
force him to undergo treatment for his
disease
okay because it was considered disease
and the uh
the treatment ended up doing some
horrible thing to him
suicide okay that's unheard of today
in maybe in some countries it still
exists but not here
you know not in england not the united
states not europe
uh now it's just a way of life accepted
like
others there's still discrimination but
there's enormous progress
and that's a lot of human histories like
that and that's why we don't have uh
slavery
feudalism
there's plenty of domestic abuse but now
it's opposed
but takes a strauss con a couple of
years ago that wouldn't even have been a
problem
and now there's cultural differences
like in france
they think the united states is too
curious
in the united states i think it's right
in this case
furthermore there are other things about
this case that are
not discussed that are critically
significant
that the hotel where this incident took
place that happens to be unionized
now there's all kind of efforts to
destroy the last remnants of the union
but the unions protect people if this
woman had been in a non-unionized hotel
she would have just been fired you're in
a non-union i should tell
a rich guest to make you know you
complain
about a rich guest you get fired okay
but she was protected by the union
and their support for overwhelming
support in the country
okay those are significant changes uh
go back 30 or 40 years domestic abuse
was not even
an issue the police didn't deal with
domestic abuse
and now the united states at least every
town
has special police units that deal just
with domestic abuse
it's not tolerated okay those are big
changes
and plenty of others so this you can be
quite happy
these are other uh expressions
of our instinctive nature our moral
realm kind of expands over time
it's now expanding to animal rights
that's
new so you can't do any
any experiment you like in say
mit and harvard the city has
restrictions on
how animals have to be treated okay it's
expanding the moral range
and it should go
linguistic on
in recent minimalist literature there
has been critique
that under feature drivenness the
inclusiveness condition
and the output conditions syntax has
lost
its batches of autonomy do you think
that minimalist syntax has become
to the activation maybe
do you think that minimalist sometimes
have become two lexicons
two large well first of all let me say a
word about autonomy
that's a notion that's been pretty
seriously misunderstood
autonomy of syntax just meant that
the syntactic rules operate without
paying attention to for example uh
you know lexical meaning or
whether the sense is true or false or
something like that
that's what autonomy of syntax men now
at the time
in the 1950s that was a like a radical
choice because it was assumed that
for example i think quine famous
politician philosopher that which was
kind of orthodox
that grammatical status is just
a reflection of meaningfulness
if a sense is meaningless it's
ungrammatical
okay that was quickly shown to be wrong
so that's autonomy
syntax and that remains
i don't think there's been any change in
the assumption that the
syntactic rules of the language are
basically independent
of for example questions of truth or
falsity
things like that actually it's not only
true of the syntax it's also true of the
formal semantics
but what's called semantics in
linguistics
is actually syntax technically
it's symbol manipulation uh semantic you
you move from
in the traditional sense the sense of uh
frega
first way back into the medieval ages
the syntax means essentially symbol
manipulation
you get the semantics when you relate it
to the outside world
so what are you referring to for example
is it true or false
that's semantics but what's called
semantics doesn't deal with it
it deals with symbol manipulation it's
all fundamentally syntax
and it's all autonomous in this sense
and that remains now the other question
the
technical one is it becoming too
dependent on the lexicon
well it depends on what the facts are
should it be dependent on the lexicon
so take features which you mentioned uh
they're
part of lexical items
and you get into quite interesting
questions here like
i mentioned before that any
computational system
by definition is going to have certain
atoms of computation
but what are they
first guess is their lexical items
but that's not obviously true and
exactly what you mentioned is a
case in point so can features function
independently inside the computational
system
okay or do you have to do they only
function as part of
complexes bigger complexes which are the
atoms
and that leads directly to
questions under intense investigation
and so for example one
mentioned feature inheritance the you
know the
five features the structural features
like uh
agreement case and so on it it's pretty
good evidence that they're
in the category c
you know the causal top clausal category
but they show up in the
inside the sentence in the tense so
they're kind of inherited
well the question is are they inherited
individually or they inherited as a
complex
actually if they're inherited as a
complex then
the question particle will also be
inherited
and that leads to an answer to the ecp
problem
on the other hand there are other
approaches that say no they have to be
answered separately open research
questions
no not negative income um inconventional
basic income which is an international
space basically every
every month you get paid for enough
being at work
so a minimal subsistence for everybody
internationally makes good sense
good
any decent health and welfare system
provides nationally
but not in the united states
unfortunately but i think here for
example as far as i understand
there is a minimal subsistence guarantee
health everyone gets health care uh
everyone gets enough to have enough food
i mean that's by now normal in
industrial societies i mean maybe it
doesn't work all the time but
at least it's the principle in the
united states too
like there's
health care shambles but
there is technically there's food
available for everyone
the food banks and so on again it
doesn't work perfectly but
theoretically it's there there's an
earned
income tax credit if a person's working
unfortunately it's not for people who
aren't working
if a person is working and doesn't have
enough income safe for a family to
survive
and it's upgraded automatically actually
this comes from the
last liberal social democratic president
in the united states richard nixon
ever since then these things have been
degraded but i'm sure that makes sense
if
it's national or not international
theoretically every country is committed
to this
if you read the universal declaration of
human rights which
everyone frankly everybody signed
uh take a look at article 25 it says
every person must be given everywhere
must be guaranteed
health education and
food and so on well you know those are
words
but at least in principle
every country every country is committed
to
hello them chomsky um i'm grateful that
you're here
uh incredible question what's your
position of the um
actual nuclear crisis which started with
fukushima
and why do you think don't uh people in
america
go to the streets the same way the
people in europe go to the streets
and what can you do as a writer and a
famous public person
to bring the
critical position um to america
well this is plainly a crisis and the
german reaction is
so far unique as far as i know and
moving towards cancelling
nuclear power i hope it spreads
elsewhere
as for going into the streets there's
plenty of that in the united states
i mean to take what just happened in
madison wisconsin
last few months the the governor
also right-wing governor backed by a
couple of multi-billionaires
koch brothers also the funders of the
tea party
there they wanted to ram through
legislation
that to ban collective bargaining rights
for
uh public sector union workers
and that led to a huge popular reaction
number tens of thousands of people in
the streets every day the
state capitol was occupied a couple of
times
and it's continuing i mean the
governor's now trying to ram
through as much rotten legislation as
you can because the whole
party might be thrown out in the coming
elections very likely will be
that's only one example there's plenty
of activism
and not enough you know but certainly
there
in fact one of the dramatic moments of
the past few months was
about march sometime when a message was
sent
by one of the major egyptian later the
labor leaders kamala bas one of the
organizers of the
egyptian protests he sent
a message in the name of the egyptian
labor movement to
working people in madison wisconsin
expressing their solidarity with
american workers
it's kind of sad that that has to happen
but it did happen
fukushima case well you know that's
you've read in the newspapers
uh every day the japanese government
releases a little more
information about how they were lying
about it and they just a couple of days
ago
conceded that the actual radiation level
was about double what they had claimed
and this process has been going on
since the catastrophe it's a huge
catastrophe
just some talk in japan finally about
doing something about nuclear power and
there are options they're not
stuck with nuclear power by any means
but it's a
major crisis everybody ought to be
reacting to it there was a meeting of
g8 rich countries that just ended
yesterday where
there were some formal responses to it
but let's have better nuclear safety and
so on but
here in germany really isn't the lead
it's taking the right position
um hello
sorry i'm a little bit excited
i'm a kurdish woman but i never learned
kurdish because i'm coming from turkey
because my language was forbidden and we
learned all the time
turkish at school and at home
my mother spoke with my grandmother in
kurdish and with me in turkish
in my communication with my grandmother
it wasn't easy
only a few words and mostly mostly
with body language so i'm an adult adult
person and
i learn foreign language
german and english i mean
i have the ability i learn it very
quickly and i also like it
but undermined i have my borders i mean
um i learned it but then i stopped to
learn
do you mean or do you think that maybe
this is related to that
i know i never learned my own mother
language
the first question is that and the
second is what exactly was the question
i i know what you're talking about in
fact yes um
i mean do you think because i think so
i don't learn the foreign final language
more because i know
i didn't learn my own language um
maybe it's at my border and
is it possible to uh to take this border
away and the second question the native
owned language of
all occupied countries are not going to
be forbidden
what's the target why are the all
languages of some
occupied countries going to be forbidden
and what do you think about the future
of kurdish issue
beyond the arabic uprising because
everyone
gives all the time the democracy message
on the arabic leaders but in their own
country in turkey
the kurdish people are going to want
even under press and
what do you think about this what do you
think about the kurdish
kurds are roughly 25 million people
scattered over a number of countries the
major concentrations in
turkey southeastern turkey as you know
and i suppose the major
ethnic group that has no anything like a
national state or some form of
political representation the turkish
case
is the worst has been the work i mean
aside from particular moments like
in the 1980s under i said i'm saying
the kurds in iraq were
subjected to horrendous treatment
and so on that contrary to what many
people believe
the west was have a lot of
responsibility for that
the reagan administration denied that it
was happening
they insisted that it was iran that was
carrying out the atrocities
the reason was because the united states
and its allies
were quite strongly supporting saddam
hussein
so they wanted him to be in fact the
reagan administration intervened to
prevent any
uh denunciation of it even a
long ugly story but apart from that
period
over time the worst regression has been
in turkey
in the 1990s it was one of the worst uh
humanitarian catastrophes of the world
of the
turkish uh army not telling anything you
don't know
in the 1990s
they carried they were carrying out a
counter insurgency campaign
in southeastern turkey which should
kill tens of thousands of people that
destroyed
according to turkish statistics about 3
500 towns and villages
probably millions of refugees i mean i
have been there a number of times you go
to istanbul
there are sections of istanbul
horrendous miserable slums
you know decaying buildings the only
people live there are kurdish refugees
from the
southeast the children can't get out of
the rooms to dangers and so on
but it's improved the first time i went
there was in
2000 and incidentally this was all
supported by the west
primarily the united states but also
germany and england
the united states was providing
practically all the arms about 80
of the arms to the turkish army uh the
flow of arms in the year one year single
year
1997 which was about the peak of the
atrocities
the clinton administration in that
single year
sent more arms to turkey than the
in the entire cold war period combined
up until the onset of the
counter-insurgency campaign
this is undiscussable in the united
states
it wasn't reported uh the
new york times for example had a
well-known reporter in ankara he refused
to report it
there's a few people in a couple small
number of people i was actually one who
were
protesting and trying to get it known
but it was suppressed
you could tell me about germany but i
suspect it was suppressed here too
germany was also providing arms not on
that skill
significant britain too so this is
basically western-backed
massive atrocities uh in
i got there right afterwards year
2000 i think that 2002
i went for a kurdish language case
a publisher was on trial
around publishers and you probably know
all this but
he was on trial for the translating a
book of mine
and the book wasn't about turkey because
it had about
five pages or ten pages on these turkish
atrocities
so he was on trial and you know i went
to
take part in the trial his lawyer who
was
then became the mayor of jarvakir also
he suggested that i uh insist on
becoming a
co-defendant at the trial that the
trials are a little fraud
they're military trials you don't have
to make any further comment
so he thought that if i insisted on
being co-defendant it probably dropped
the trial which is exactly what happened
so i was a co-defendant the prosecutor
and the judge
had obviously agreed they had been
ordered you know
terminated trial too much negative
publicity in europe
necessarily terminated he was let off
later
back according it was pretty ugly then i
went around
i went to jar buckets at least in turkey
with
some turkish human rights activists very
turkeys the only country that i know
where leading intellectuals very
prominent intellectuals
major writers academics journalists
publishers they not only protest the
atrocities
they're carrying out constant civil
disobedience against them
and facing harsh sentences sometimes in
europe
no country like that that i know in fact
intellectuals are usually just servants
of power
turkey's unique but when i come to
europe and i hear people
talk about how turkey isn't civilized
enough to be
let into the european union you have to
laugh
i mean they can teach lessons to western
intellectuals
uh very of course they won't listen they
won't record it
but it's a striking difference so i was
able to go with them
to jarvakia and take part in some
prosecutor's office and so on and
yarmouth here
when you walked around town in those
days
i was also going with the
main investigator for human rights watch
very good
man he was later kicked out of the
country because he's too good
but new kurdish new turkish you know
understood the situation and he would
occasionally direct me away from a
certain street
we were of course followed by turkish
security people
and if he if there was a street where
there were children
playing who had
among them the colors of the kurdish
flag
he didn't want me to go down that street
because after i left the families to be
picked up
and thrown in jail you know so we went
somewhere else and there were people
living in
caves and the walls of yarmouth here in
walt city
it was pretty ugly but that was i think
to 2000 or so look back a little later
there were some improvements
the last time i was there was quite
considerably improved
there is now there is a curtain that you
still can't teach kurdish in school
but it's more open i mean there's a
kurdish radio station
people don't talk kurdish freely they're
not afraid to
show the colors of the flag there's more
tolerance it's an improvement so yes
it's still plenty of repression
but uh nothing like it was like in the
90s very the early part of the
millennium
so that's to the good and europe could
make a difference
instead of pretending that uh
i'm sure the reason for not allowing
turkey to the european union has nothing
to do with
human rights violations has to do with
the fact that
germans don't want to have turks walking
around the street or something like that
but it's european races but
it can have a very positive effect here
if policies change so you're right that
it's a bad situation but
things can be done as to
learning not learning your native
language i mean that's
a serious problem there's no general
theory about it but if people are
deprived
forcefully of their native
language culture society it has a
damaging effect
and severely damaging effect and it
something that shouldn't be tolerated
they shouldn't be tolerated in the
western countries either so i don't know
how it works
here but in the united states there's a
strong the big hispanic
population in the united states now many
of them
fleeing from horrendous atrocities
carried out by the united
states and latin america is still
fleeing in fact
but they come to the united states if
they can make it and
they are the children are permitted into
the school system
but there's there's an issue about
whether they should be allowed to have
bilingual education
should they be allowed to study in their
own language
well you know by any civilized criteria
they
should they'll learn the second language
anyway
and they'll get ahead more effectively
if they can
study in their own language that's a big
issue it probably exists here too
know so sure it should be permitted
in fact should be encouraged these are
other major
human rights issues and it can have an
effect you said it had an effect on you
i
don't doubt it
mr chomsky it's an honor to hear you
speak in person
um i study linguistics
but work as a journalist so i also have
two questions
um the first one is uh related to this
idea of um this
kind of proto mother
language that um you know maybe this is
more of a pop culture
a perceptive pop culture idea that um
there was this one
mother language perhaps your theoretical
eve
met her theoretical atom somewhere in
africa and then their offspring
developed this mother
tongue that somehow the rest of the
languages in the world branched off of
um so what's your take on that first
secondly um i was recently talking to a
sociologist
doing a story about the left radical
actions
in berlin for mayday and
he described the movement he said what
he said and this was really interesting
to me was that
anarchism basically doesn't exist in
germany he was really talking about
anarcho-cynicalism
and you know that kind of strain of
anarchism and what he's
the word he used to describe um you know
kind of what came out of the
i guess starting with the student
movement and the squatters and
anti-nuclear is autonomous autonomous
movement
and i wanted to get your take on
shifting of labels
because anarchists have also
unfortunately taken on a whole
negative array of meanings that have
nothing to do actually with anarchism
so two questions thank you
well as far as the mother language is
concerned
as far as i can see this but the only
coherent possibility
so go back to eve
but whoever had this uh mutation
they that person developed the language
an internal language
when it got externalized in a small
group
it was everybody's language after that
by about 50 000 years ago
some small group left
africa very quickly expanded over the
whole world
i mean they didn't evolution 10 20 000
years they're everywhere
by about 30 000 years ago all over
europe
uh actually first went
down along the southern uh part of
eurasia
apple beginning and so on but then moved
up
came back towards europe as the ice age
receded and so on
at that point they were already
separating into many different languages
probably whatever the reason maybe the
ones we were talking about
but that there was a particular
motherland which is
almost certain unless there was multiple
genesis which is conceivable
but it's hard to believe why should they
all have the same properties
and it's very striking to notice that
this there is storm evidence for
that there has been no evolutionary
change for 50 000 years
uh you take a child from a remote tribe
in
papua new guinea or the amazon which had
no human contact
now you take a child from there the same
as
children here they'll learn the same
language the same will become quantum
physicists
there are individual differences but
there are no known group differences in
cognitive capacity or language capacity
so apparently whatever happened was done
fifty thousand years ago and didn't
begin much before that
uh so yes i think there's good evidence
that there was another language
now we can recover of course in fact
historical linguistics uh
it goes back maybe 10 000 years
near the point of the origin of language
but as for the
anarchism question it's true that
anarchism
got a bad name but it got it in the late
19th century
you know assassinations
unprovoked violence is a strain of what
was called the anarchist movement which
was very destructive
on the other hand it was a strain that
was very constructed like an
anarcho-syndicalism which is a major
strain of anarchism
actually developed substantially in
germany
mostly from france and switzerland but
also in germany people like rudolf
rocker one of the major
anarcho-syndicalist thinkers
it was originally germany but to london
uh in the united states but is it
have an effect i think it has a big
effect i mean it takes a
co-determination in the german
industrial system
well you know it doesn't work the way it
ought to but
something is there and i think it comes
from these
libertarian strains that which
were reflected in the
anarcho-syndicalist movement
now the great success of
anarcho-syndicalism was
in the latin countries in fact
marx it was pretty authoritarian uh one
of the reasons he
destroyed the first international it was
because there was too much influence
of the anarchists in the
latin countries he thought it would be
german-centered
so he basically destroyed it finally
moved it to the united states
disappeared but and it was
quite it reached its uh its major peak
in spain
in 1936 which is a very important
development
there was a major anarchist revolution
in spain since
franco came unseen it liberated a lot of
uh spain created the anarchist
institutions which were
pretty successful it faced
and it was attacked from every side
uh hitler and mussolini attacked it they
sent troops to franco
the liberal democracies attacked it uh
russia was right in the at the
peak of the attack on they hated
anarchism and stalinist
they were the police and so on they
killed the leading activists
crushed it in fact this is what we call
the spanish civil war
actually took place pretty much after
all sides had agreed to crush the
anarchist revolution after that then
they turned to
fighting over the spoils who'd pick it
up
but that was a real success and it's
never been reconstituted
anything like that the autonomous
movements had
different sources or some
roots of this
i think these anarchist strains still
exist all over the place
and you see them in all kinds of popular
movements in fact you see them in
every attack on hierarchical
authoritarian structures and there's
plenty of those
i think okay i have the honor to ask the
final question
i don't know um first of all thank you
very much for being here inspiring all
of us
it's a great honor my question was and
still is
what is the most powerful method or way
for humans
to change the world to a more peaceful
place
without causing any harm what is the key
resource we as human beings have
to do so well
i i i don't think there's any general
answer
i mean it depends what you're trying to
deal with
there are many problems in the world
there are different ways of
dealing with particular ones um so
say the treatment of turks in germany
which came up well there's certain ways
of dealing with that and i think we all
know what they are
no big secret it's a matter of doing
suppose you're concerned with the
fukushima also okay things to do about
that
try to expand the german model to the
rest of the world but
you know how to do that and just pick
the case
and whatever the case may be there are
usually a
pretty straightforward ways of dealing
with it there's not going
to there's no general so there's no
magic key you know there's no magic
heating in terms of
problems but
one of the difficulties with the a lot
of the
activist movements of young people like
68
1968 you could see right off that 1968
was going to collapse
because there was a sense which is kind
of understandable if you're
20 years old that if i do something
everything's going to be wonderful so if
we sit in on the
president's office at the columbia
university for three weeks
peace and love in the world it doesn't
work like that
it's a matter of concerted
dedicated long-term activism
which over time can have effects but
there's not going to be any instant
gratification
and it's part of the problem of the
uh plenty of things wrong with the old
communist parties
not to go into that but there was one
thing right about them
they knew that it's a long-term process
you're going to have to be there
all the time this will be defeated and
you come back
the next time there were always people
around who
have maintained the tradition of hard
work and organizing
back in the 1930s there was some people
who knew how to turn you know
put out pamphlets that i had to carry
out organizing for the next stage
in fact part of the fear of communist
parties in the west
it was just that they were too effective
at organizing
i mentioned last night that
in germany for example in the early
post-war period
the united states was dedicated to as
they put it
wall off germany from the eastern zone
it's the term they use
and it's interesting to look at the
reasons the reasons were they felt that
they could not compete
with the left labor influences that were
coming from the east
at that time so that they weren't able
to compete with us they had to walk all
the west off
and then crush left and labor here
in germany and a lot of other places
it's mostly wiped out of history i doubt
if you read it in school
but that's what happened you can find
the scholarly work and the documents and
so on
and it's precisely for that reason and
with all
the flaws terrors and so on of the
communist parties they did
provide that cadre of committed
organizers and activists which is stay
there they were ready for the next phase
the as the kind of
continuity of activist movements has
been broken
and each new stage comes along everyone
starts in the beginning
and they're very often driven by young
people
but the young people tend
typically to expect something to happen
fast
we'll do something courageous and
dangerous and it'll all be over
and that doesn't happen so we just have
to
learn the lessons from history as to
what did work
and there are many things that worked
and there's no
single answer but there are almost
always specific answers
so i don't think that the level of
generality of your question
can be an answer but if we look at
particular cases i think there are
things to do
does academia can i mean the
universities
actually in many ways are a lot freer
than they were in the 1950s and 60s
this long distance to go and there's
also regression
but sure there are things you can do in
the universities actually
students in the university should
understand that they are in the period
of their lives
when they've reached the peak of any
freedom they're going to have
they're free of parental control
they're typically not yet in the
situation where they have to
put food on the table for a family see a
lot of options
being at a university offers plenty of
freedom
incomparable by most standards so yes
there are
things you can do at the university of
specialties
thank you very much
you
