welcome
everyone I'm Ola Yik I'm director of Cs
men and we are extremely happy to have
Professor n chsky with us let me just
say that he's the most quoted writer in
Academia alive no no comparison at all
than anybody else and I think it's fair
to say say he is number one public
intellectual in the world so
please professor chsky
your I'll talk some about Isaac Newton
and his contributions to a study of mine
that he's not known for that but I think
a case can be made that uh he did make
substantial indirect but nevertheless
substantial contributions I'd like to
explain why uh there is a familiar view
that uh the early Scientific Revolution
beginning through the 17th century uh
provided humans with u Limitless
explanatory power and that that
conclusion is established more firmly by
uh Darwin's discoveries theory of
evolution uh I'm have in mind
specifically a recent uh uh publication
exposition of this view by two
distinguished physicist
philosophers David Albert and David
Deutsch but it's commonly held with many
variants uh there's a corollary the
corollary is a ridicule of what's called
by many philosophers mysterianism that's
the Absurd notion that there are
mysteries of nature that human
intelligence will never be able to
grasp uh it's of some interest to notice
that uh this belief is radically
different from the conclusions of the
great figures who actually carried out
the early Scientific Revolution also
interesting to notice how inconsistent
it is with uh what the theory of
evolution implies and has always been
understood to imply since its Origins
and I'd like to say a few words about
those two topics in
turn uh start with David Humes a history
of England there's of course a chapter
on the Scientific Revolution and in
particular on the crucial role of Isaac
Newton who he describes as the greatest
and rarest genius that ever arose for
the ornament and instruction of the
species and Hume concluded that uh uh
Newton's great greatest achievement was
that while he seemed to draw the veil
from some of the mysteries of nature he
showed at the same time the
imperfections of the mechanical
philosophy uh and thereby restored
Nature's ultimate secrets to that
obscurity in which they ever did and
ever will remain the mechanical
philosophy of course was uh The Guiding
doctrine of the Scientific Revolution
tion it held that the world is a
machine a grander version of the kind of
autom that stimulated the imagination of
thinkers of the time much in the way
programmed
computers uh doe today they were
thinking of the remarkable clocks the
artifacts constructed by skilled
Artisans most famous was Jack
Deon devices that imitated
digestion animal behavior or the
machines that uh you could find in the
Royal Gardens as you walk through the
pronounced words when they were
triggered and uh and many other such
devices the mechanical philosophy wanted
to dispense with occult Notions uh necas
Notions of forms flitting through the
air sympathies and antipathy AES other
such occult ideas and it wanted to be
hard-headed to keep to what's grounded
in common sense understanding and it in
fact provided the Criterion for
intelligibility from Galileo through
Newton and indeed well beyond well it's
well known also that dekart claimed to
have explained the phenomena of the
material world in such mechanical terms
of while also demonstrating that they're
not all
encompassing uh don't reach into the
domain of mind his view uh he therefore
postulated a new principle to account
for what was beyond the reach of the
mechanical philosophy and while this too
is sometimes ridiculed it's in fact full
in accord with normal scientific uh not
scientific method uh he was working
within the framework of substance
philosophy so the new principle was a
second substance his race katans and
then there's a scientific problem that
he and others faced determining its
character and ask determining how it
interacts with the mechanical world
that's the Mind Body problem cast within
the Scientific Revolution and it's a
scientific problem well it was for a
Time the mechanical philosophy was
shattered by Newton as human observed
and with it went the notion of
understanding of the world that the
Scientific Revolution sought to attain
and the Mind Body problem also
disappeared and I don't believe has been
resurrected though this still a lot of
talk about with it uh those conclusions
actually were pretty well
understood uh in the centuries that
followed they've often been forgotten
today uh John Lock had already reached
conclusions rather similar to Humes he
was exploring the nature of our ideas
and he recognized I'll quote him that
body as far as we can conceive is able
only to strike and affect body and
motion according to the utmost reach of
our ideas uh is able to produce nothing
but
motion uh these are the basic tenants of
course of the mechanical philosophy they
yield the conclusion that there can be
no interaction without
contact which is our all common sense in
intuition and modern research and
cognitive science has given a lot of has
given pretty much pretty solid grounds
for lucks Reflections on the nature of
our
ideas uh it's
revealed uh that our Common Sense
understanding
U of the nature of bodies and and their
interactions as now nowadays we would
say in large part genetically determined
uh it's a lot it's very much as lock
describe uh very young infants can
recognize a principle of causality
through contact not in any other way if
they recognize causality they seek a
hidden contact somewhere and uh uh those
in fact appear to be the limits of our
ideas
of our Common Sense uh the occult ideas
of the Scholastics or of Newton
Newtonian attraction it goes beyond our
understanding and is
unintelligible at least by the criteria
of the Scientific Revolution uh very
much like Hume lock concluded therefore
that we REM we remain in incurable
ignorance of what we desire to know
about matter and its effects no science
of bodies is within our reach and he
went on to say we can only appeal to the
arbitrary determination of that all-wise
agent who has made them to be and
operate as they do in a manner wholly
above our weak understanding to conceive
actually Galileo had reached much the
same conclusions at the end of his life
he was frustrated by the failure of the
mechanical philosophy his ideal its
failure to account for cohesion
attraction other phenomena and he was
forced to reject quoting him the vain
presumption of understanding everything
were to conclude even worse that there
is not a single effect in nature such
that the most ingenious theorist can
arrive at a complete understanding of it
actually dekart though more optimistic
had also recognized the limits of our
cognitive reach occasionally he's not
entirely consistent about this but uh
rule eight of the reguli reads if the
series of subjects to be examined if in
the series of subjects to be examined we
come to a subject of which our intellect
cannot gain a good enough intuition we
must stop there and we must not examine
the other matters that follow but must
remain from we frin from feudal toil uh
specifically decart speculated that the
workings of race katans second subject
substance may be Beyond human
understanding so he thought quoting him
again we may not have intelligence
enough to understand the workings of
Mind in particular uh the normal use of
language one of his main concept uh he
recognized that the normal use of
language has what has come to be called
a creative aspect it's uh every every
human being but no beast machine uh is
uh has this capacity to use language in
ways that are appropriate to situations
but not caused by them it's crucial
difference and to formulate and express
thoughts that uh maybe entirely new and
to do so without bound uh maybe incited
or inclined to speak in certain ways by
internal and external circumstances but
not compelled to do so it's the way his
followers put the matter which was a
mystery to decart and remains a mystery
to us uh though it quite clearly is a
fact uh well deart nevertheless
continued that even if the explanation
of normal use of language and other
forms of free and coherent choice of
action uh even if that lies beyond our c
cognitive grasp as it apparently does
that's no reason he said to question the
authenticity of our
experience quite generally he said the
Free Will which is at the core of this
is the noblest thing we have and there
is nothing we comprehend more evidently
and more perfectly so it would therefore
be absurd to doubt something that we
comprehend intimately and experience
within ourselves namely that the free
action of men are undetermined merely
because it conflicts with something else
which we know must be by its nature
incomprehensible to us uh much like Lo
he had in mind Divine preordination one
of the leading Galileo Scholars Peter
machar observes that by adopting the
mechanical philosophy and thus
initiating the modern Scientific
Revolution uh Galileo had forged a new
model of intelligibility for human
understanding with new criteria for
coherent explanation of natural
phenomena so for
Galileo real understanding requires a
mechanical model that is a device that
an AR Artisan could construct at least
in principle U hence intelligible to us
so Galileo rejected traditional theories
of tithes because as he said we cannot
duplicate by means of appropriate
artificial devices and his great
successors adhered to these high
standards of intelligibility and
explanation so it's therefore
quite understandable why Newton's
discoveries were so stridently resisted
by the greatest scientists of the day
Christian Hans described Newton's
concept of Attraction as an absurdity uh
liet charged that he would was
reintroducing occult ideas similar to
the sympathies and antipathies of the of
the much ridiculed Scholastic science
and he was offering no physical
explanation uh for phenomena of the
material world and it's important to
notice that Newton agreed very largely
agreed he wrote that the notion of
action at a distance is
inconceivable it's so great an absurdity
that I believe no man who as in
philosophical matters a competent
faculty of thinking can never fall into
it philosophical means what we call
scientific uh by invoking that principle
he said we concede uh that
we we do not understand the phenomen of
the material world so and Newton
scholarship recognizes that I Cohen for
example or dukester house pick someone
else uh points out that uh by the word
understand Newton still meant what his
critics meant understand in mechanical
terms of contact contact
action uh Newton did have a famous
phrase which you all know I the phrase I
frame no hypothesis and it's in this
context that it appears uh he had been
unable to discover the physical cause of
gravity so he left the question open he
said to us it is enough that gravity
does really exist and act according to
the laws which we have explained and
abundantly serves to account for all the
Motions of the celestial bodies and of
our sea the tides but while
agreeing as he did that his proposals
were so absurd that no serious scientist
could take them seriously
he defended himself from the charge that
he was reverting to the mysticism of the
aristotelians what he argued was that
his principles were not occult only
their causes were occult so in his words
to derive general principles inductively
from phenomena and afterwards to tell to
tell us how the properties of actions of
all corporeal things follow from these
manifest principles
would be a very great step in philosophy
of in science though the causes of the
principles were not yet discovered and
by the phrase not yet discovered Newton
the word yet is crucial Newton was
expressing his hope that the causes
would someday be discovered in physical
terms meaning mechanical terms that was
a hope that lasted right through the
19th century it was finally dashed by
20th century science so that hope is
gone uh the model of
intelligibility that reigned from
Galileo through Newton and the well
beyond has a corollary when mechanism
fails understanding fails so Newton's
absurdities were finally over time just
incorporated
into Common Sense Natural Science Study
them in school today uh but that's quite
different different from Common Sense
understanding uh so to put it
differently one long-term consequence of
the Newtonian Revolution was to lower
the standards of intelligibility for
natural science that is the hope to
understand the world which did animate
the modern Scientific Revolution that
was finally abandoned it was replaced by
a very different and far less demanding
goal namely to develop intelligible
theories of the world
so as such further absurdities as say
curved SpaceTime or Quantum
indeterminacy were absorbed into the
Natural Sciences the very idea of an
intelligible uh of intelligibility is
dismissed as itself observed for example
by berand Russell who knew the Sciences
very well by the late
1920s he repeatedly PR places the word
intelligible in quotes to highlight the
absurdity of the quest and he dismisses
the uh qualms of the founders the great
founders of the Scientific Revolution
Newton others dismisses them as their
qualms about action at a distance he
dismisses these as little more than a
Prejudice although a more sympathetic
and I think accurate description would
be that they simply had higher standards
of
intelligibility and if you look at the
the work of leading physicists they more
or less say the same thing so a couple
years after Russell wrote Paul durac
wrote a well-known introduction to
Quantum Mechanics in which he says that
physical science no longer seeks to
provide pictures of how the world works
that is a model functioning on
essentially classical lines but only
seeks to provide a way of looking at the
fundamental laws which makes their
self-consistency obvious is so we
understand the theories we've given up
trying to understand the world he was
referring of course to the
inconceivable conclusions of quantum
physics but if modern thinkers hadn't
forgotten the past he could just as well
have been referring to uh the classical
Newtonian models and uh which were
undermined by Newton undermining the
hope of rendering natural phenomena
intelligible that was the primary goal
the animating Spirit of the early
Scientific
Revolution there's a classic 19th
century history of materialism by
Friedrich longa translated into English
an introduction by Russell uh langa
observes that we have so accustomed
ourselves to the abstract notion of
forces or rather to a notion hovering in
a Mystic obscurity between abstraction
and concrete comprehension that we no
longer find any difficulty in making one
particle of matter act upon another
without immediate contact through void
space without a material link from such
ideas the great mathematicians and
physicists of the 17th century were far
removed they were genuine
materialists they insisted that contact
immediate contact is a condition of
influence uh this transition he says was
one of the most important turning points
in the whole history of materialism
deprived the notion of much significance
if any at all and with materialism goes
the notion of physical of body and other
counterparts uh they have no longer any
significance and he adds that what
Newton uh held to be such a great
absurdity that no philosophic thinker
could light upon it is prized by post
posterity as Newton's great discovery of
the harmony of the universe those
conclusions are quite commonplace in
history of science so 50 years ago
Alexander cor another great historian of
Science and scientist observed that uh
despite his unwillingness to accept the
conclusion Newton had
demonstrated that a purely materialistic
pattern of nature is utterly impossible
and a purely materialistic or
mechanistic physics as well his
mathematical physics required the
admission into the body of Science of
incomprehensible and
inexplicable facts imposed on us by
empiricism that is by what we conclude
from
observations uh despite the this
recognition the debates did not end so
about a century ago
boltzman's molecular theory of gases or
kul's structural chemistry in fact even
B's adom ones you all learn in school
these were only given an instrumental
interpretation modern history of
chemistry standard history points out
that they were regarded as calculating
devices but with no physical reality and
Newton's belief that the causes of his
principles were not yet discovered
implying that they would be was uh
echoed
uh it was echoed by for example by
berand Russell in
1927 he wrote that chemical laws cannot
at present be reduced to physical laws
much like Newton he hoped it would
happen and he expected that it would but
that expectation also proved to be vain
as vain as Newton shortly after Russell
wrote this it was shown that chemical
laws will never be reduced to physical
laws because the conception of physical
laws was
erroneous finally done in lonus
pauling's Quantum theoretic account of
the chemical
bond uh short u ex very much as in
Newton's day uh the perceived
explanatory Gap as it's now called by
philosophers was never field uh today
interestingly just a few years ago we
read of the thesis of the new biology
that things mental indeed minds are
emergent properties of brains though
these emergencies are emergencies are
produced by principles that we do not
yet understand that's a neuroscientist
Vernon mountcastle he's formulating The
Guiding theme of a collection of
essays uh
reviewing the results of what was called
the decade of the brain last decade of
the 20th century his phrase we do not
yet understand might very well suffer
the same fate as Russell's similar
comment about chemistry 70 years earlier
or for that matter Newton's much earlier
one uh in fact in many ways today's
theory of mind I think is recapitulating
errors that were exposed in the
1930s with regard to chemistry and uh
centuries before that with regard to
core physics though in that case leaving
us with a mystery maybe a permanent one
for humans as Hume
speculated actually
asserted uh throughout all this and
today as well we can
optimistically look forward to
unification of some kind but not
necessarily reduction which is something
quite different talk about reductionism
is highly misleading it's been abandoned
over and over again in the history of
science uh seeking unification much
weaker
goal sometimes in the case of uh classic
case of Newton and what he left veiled
in mystery that's may involve a
significant lowering of expectations and
standards well let me go back to the
beginning the exuberant thesis that the
early Scientific Revolution provided
humans with Limitless explanatory power
if we look over the history I think a
quite different conclusion is in order
the founders of the Scientific
Revolution were compelled by their
discoveries to recognize that human
explanatory power is not only not
Limitless but does not even reach to the
most Elementary phenom phen of the
natural world that's masked by lowering
the criteria of intelligibility of
understanding well according if we
accept that much as I think we should uh
a less ambitious question arises the
goals of science having been lowered to
finding intelligible theories we can
sensibly can we sensibly maintain we can
ask this can we sensibly maintain that
uh humanly accessible theories are
Limitless in their explanatory scope
it's a much weaker goal and furthermore
does the theory of evolution establish
the Limitless reach of human cognitive
Capa powers in this narrow or more
limited sense actually if you think
about it the opposite conclusion seems
much more reasonable the theory of
evolution of course places humans firmly
within the natural world it regards
humans as biological iCal organisms very
much like others and for every such
organism uh its capacities have scope
and limits to go together that includes
the cognitive domain so rats for example
can't solve for say a prime number maze
it's because they lack the appropriate
Concepts uh it's not lack of memory or
anything like that they just don't have
the concepts so for rats we can make a
useful distinction between problems and
Mysteries uh problems are tasks that lie
within their cognitive reach in
principle Mysteries are ones that don't
mysteries for rats they may not be
mysteries for
us uh if humans Are Not Angels if we're
part of the organic world then human
cognitive capacity is also going to have
scope and limits so accordingly the uh
distinction between problems and
Mysteries holds for
humans and it's a task for science to
delimit it uh maybe we can maybe we
can't but at least it's a formulable
task and not inconsistent it's not
inconsistent to think that we might be
able to discover the limits of our
cognitive capacities uh therefore those
who accept Modern Biology should all be
mysterians instead of ridiculing it
because mysterianism follows directly
from
the theory of evolution everything we
believe about scientifically believe
about humans so the common ridicule of
this
concept right through philosophy of mind
what it amounts to is the claim that
somehow humans are angels exempt from
biological constraints and in fact far
from bewailing the existence of
mysteries for humans that we should be
extremely grateful for it because if
there are no limit to what we might call
say the science forming capacity it
would also have no scope uh just as if
the genetic endowment uh imposed no
constraints on
growth uh it would mean that we could be
at most some shapeless amib boid
creature reflecting accidents of an
unanalyzed
environment uh the conditions that
prevent a human embryo from becoming say
a insect or a chicken
those very same conditions uh play a
critical role in determining that the
embryo can become a human can't have one
without the other and the same holds in
the cognitive domain actually classical
aesthetic Theory recognized that
recognized that there's a relation
between scope and limits without any
rules there can be no genuine creative
activity and that's even the case when
creative work challenges and revises
prevailing rules so far from
establishing the Limitless scope of
human cognitive capacities modern
evolutionary theory and in fact all
standard science undermines that hope
now that was actually appreciated right
away when the power of the theory of
evolution came to be
recognized one enlightening cases
Charles Sanders purse and his inquiry
into what he call
abduction which is rather different from
the way the term is used today uh purse
was struck particularly by a striking
fact that in the history of science
major discoveries are often made
independently and almost
simultaneously which suggests that some
principle is directing inquiring minds
towards that goal under the existing
circumstances of
understanding uh and uh something
similar is true for Early Childhood
learning so if you put aside the
pathology pathology or extreme
deprivation the children are essentially
uniform in this capacity and uh they
uniformly make quite astounding
discoveries about the world going well
beyond what any kind of data analysis
could could yield in the case of
language it's now known that that's
starts even before birth so a child is
born with some conception of what counts
as a language uh and can even
recognize its mother's language is
distinct from another language both
spoken by a bilingual woman who's it's
never heard before there's some
interesting distinctions determining how
it works but can be done at Birth uh and
in fact even the first step of language
acquis position which is generally sort
of just taken for granted is quite a
remarkable achievement uh an infant has
to select from the environment from what
William James called the blooming
buzzing confusion the infant has to
somehow select the data that are
language related that's a task that's a
total mystery for any other organism
they have absolutely no way of doing it
but it's a reflexively solved problem
for human infants and so the story
continues all the way to the outer
reaches of scientific discovery well uh
it may not be continuous I'm not
suggesting that there's probably
different capacities involved uh rather
like Hume the purse concluded that
humans must have what he called an
abductive instinct which provides a
limit on admissible hypotheses so that
only certain explanatory schemes can be
entertained but not infinitely many
others all compatible with available
data uh Pur argued that this Instinct
develops through natural selection that
is the variants that yield truths about
the world provide a selectional
advantage that are retained through
descent with modification Darwin's
Notions While others fall away that
belief is completely unsustainable takes
only a moment to show that that can't be
true and if you drop it as we must we're
left with a serious and challenging
scientific problem namely determine the
innate components of our cognitive
nature those that are employed in
reflexive identification of language
relevant data or in other cognitive
domains take one famous case the
capacity of humans which is quite
remarkable to uh if if presented with a
sequence of tachistoscopic presentations
just dots on a screen three dots on a
screen presented with a sequence of
these of what you perceive is a rigid
object in motion uh some of the
cognitive principles are known but not
the neural basis for it uh or for
example discovering and comprehending
Newton's laws or developing String
Theory or solving problems of quantum
entanglement or as complex as you like
and there is a further task that's to
determine the scope and limits of human
understanding incidentally some
differently structured organism some
Martian say might regard human Mysteries
as simple problems and might wonder that
we can't find the answers or even ask
the right questions just as we
wonder about the inability of rats to to
run prime number mazes it's not because
of limits of memory or other superficial
constraints but because of the very
design of our cognitive nature and their
cognitive nature so actually if you
think it through I think it's quite
clear that Newton's remarkable
achievements led to a significant
lowering of the expectations of science
a severe restriction on the role of
intelligibility they further more
demonstrated that it's an error to
ridicule What's called the Ghost and the
Machine that's what I and others were
taught at your age in the best graduate
schools Harvard and my case but that's
just a mistake Newton did not exercise
the ghost rather he exercised the
machine he left the ghost completely
intact and by so doing he uh
inadvertently set the study of Mind on a
quite a new course in fact made it
possible to integrate it into the
sciences and and Newton may very well
have realized this uh throughout his
life he struggled later life struggled
vainly of course with the paradoxes and
conundrums that he followed from his
theory and he speculated that what he
called
Spirit which he couldn't identify but
whatever it is might be the cause of all
movement in nature including the power
of moving our body by our thoughts and
the same power within other living
creatures though how this is done and by
what laws we do not know that we cannot
say he concluded that all nature is not
alive going A Step Beyond Newton lock
suggested lock added that we cannot say
that matter does not think that's a
speculation that's called the lock
suggestion in the history of philosophy
so as lock put it just as God had added
to motion inconceivable effects it is
not much more remote from our
comprehension to conceive that God can
if he pleases super add to matter a
faculty of thinking uh Lo found this
view repugnant to the idea of Senseless
matter but he said that we cannot reject
it because of our incurable ignorance
and the limits of our ideas that is our
cognitive
capacities uh having no intelligible
concept of matter or body or physical as
we still don't incidentally but having
no such concept we he said we cannot
dismiss the possibility of living or
thinking matter uh particularly uh after
Newton had undermined totally undermined
Common Sense understanding permanently
uh lock suggestion was understood and it
was taken up right through the N the
18th century Hume for example concluded
that uh motion may be and actually is
the cause of our thought and
perception others argued that since
thought which is produced in the brain
cannot exist if this organ is
wanting uh and since there's no reason
any longer to question the existence of
thinking matter it's necessary to
conclude that the brain is a special
organ designed to produce thought much
as the stomach and the intestines are
designed to operate the digestion the
liver to filter bile and so on through
the bodily organs so just as Foods enter
the stomach and leave it with new
qualities so Impressions arrive at the
brain through the nerves and are then uh
isolated they they arrive isolated and
without any coherence but the organ the
brain enters into action it acts on them
it sends them back changed into
ideas which the language of physiognomy
and gesture or the signs of speech and
writing manifest outwardly I'm still
quoting we conclude then with the same
certainty that the brain digests as it
were the
Impressions uh that that is organically
it makes the secretion of thought just
as the liver secretes bile Darwin put
them at who agreed with this put the
matter succinctly he asked rhetorically
why is thought being a secretion of the
brain more wonderful than gravity a
property of matter a property that we
don't understand but we just came to
accept uh it's therefore rather odd to
read today what I quoted before the
leading thesis of the decade of the
brain that ended the last century namely
that things mental indeed minds are
emergent properties of brains Mount
castle
summary uh strange to read that because
it was common place in the 18th century
so it's not clear why it's an emerging
thesis and it's many other prominent
scientists and philosophers have
presented essentially the same thesis as
quote some contemporary examples an
astonishing hypothesis of the new
biology a radical new idea in the
philosophy of mind the Bold assertion
that mental phenomena are entirely
natural and caused by the
neurophysiological activities of the
brain uh opening the door
to novel promising inquiries a rejection
of cartisian Mind Body dualism and so on
all of these reiterate and virtually the
same
words formulations of centuries
ago uh the traditional Mind Body problem
having become unformulated
which he developed in quite interesting
ways an idea which was stated in
different words less detailed by Hume
Darwin many others and almost
inescapable it would seem after the
collapse of the mechanical
philosophy well with the belated Revival
of ideas that were reasonably well
understood centuries ago uh and are
direct conclusions of Newton's
discoveries uh we're left with uh
scientific problems about the theory of
mind they can be pursued in many ways
like other questions of science maybe
with an eye to eventual unification
whatever form it may take if any that
Enterprise renews a task that Hume
understood quite well he called it the
investigation of the science of human
nature the search for the secret Springs
and principles by which the human mind
is actuated in it
operations including those parts of our
knowledge that are derived from the
original hand of nature so what we would
call genetic endowment another Hume of
course is you know the arch empiricist
but also a dedicated
nativist supposed to be the opposite of
empiricism and he had to be because he
was reasonable uh the uh this this
inquiry which uh Hume compared in
principle Newton's had in fact been
undertaken in quite sophisticated Ways
by English
neoplatonist and work that directly
influenced
Kant uh in there's a contemporary in
contemporary literature there are other
names for this it's sometimes called
naturalization of philosophy or
epistemology naturalized or sometimes
just cognitive science but in fact it's
the direct uh consequence of suon a
demolition of the idea of grasping the
nature of the world and inescapable so
let me just summarize briefly I think
it's fair to conclude that the hopes and
expectations of the early Scientific
Revolution were dashed by Newton's
discoveries which leaves us with several
conclusions one conclusion actually
reinforced by Darwin is that while our
cognitive capacities maybe vast and
scoped they are nonetheless
intrinsically limited uh some questions
that we might like to explore May well
beyond lie beyond our cognitive reach
that we may not even be able to
formulate the right questions uh the
standards of success may have to be
lowered once again as has happened
before very dramatically with the
collapse of the mechanical philosophy
and another conclusion is that the Mind
Body problem can safely be put to rest
since there is no coherent alternative
to lock suggestion and if we adopt lock
suggestion that opens the way to the
study of Mind as a branch of biology
much like the study of the rest of the
body you know the body blow the neck
putting it
metaphorically uh a great deal has been
learned in the past half century of
Revival of traditional concerns of the
early Scientific Revolution and the
enlightenment but many of the uh early
leading questions have not been answered
and may never be thanks
[Applause]
thank you very much we're going to open
for questions and comments right away uh
I have a question uh about uh Mind Body
you just uh ended here with like maybe
we should uh just forget that dilemma
and uh my question to you is uh if you
have uh thought about instead of a
punish it about instead of just to
forget it and put it in the bracket uh
then we can just add another Factor mind
body and the senses and see what happens
and I my question to you is have you
have you anything to say about that
combination mind body and the senses yes
well mind body is meaningless if there's
no body there's no mind body problem
and there hasn't been any concept of
body since Newton I mean Newton still
thought there was there was one but as
he put it we haven't yet discovered it
meaning accounted for it in mechanical
terms but that's been given up certainly
by the 20th century so there is no
concept of physical the term physical is
just kind of like an honorific word kind
of like the word real when we say the
real truth it doesn't add anything it
just says this is what I you know
serious truth so to say that something's
physical today just means you got to
take it seriously but there's no further
concept of physical or material or body
so there can't be a mindbody problem
it's unformulated
okay thank you so and we we all agree
you know so there's some way in which uh
external the external World impinges on
an organism and the way that happens is
what we call the senses and we have
different senses from other organisms
like you know there are other organisms
much smarter than us they can see
ultraviolet light and hear things we
can't hear and so on but uh we all have
our scope and limit with senses
too you said that we there was some kind
of reduction of expectations of what an
explanation should be when it was no
more mechanical and not necessarily
mechanical understandable and I wonder
the relation between mechanical and
material
is and also I I I've just been to a
conference on Gregory baton and he's
he's very into this idea of H
information being a difference that
makes a difference and he says that
difference is intrinsically
non-material so the the cybernetic
causalities they are non-material but
still mechanical and and then I wonder
what is the relation between mechanical
and material and could that be some of
the problem well there can't be a
relation because there's no such thing
as
material that's like saying what's the
relation between information and
ectoplasm you can't ask that question
till you tell us what ectoplasm is and
nobody can tell us what material is
actually when you look at modern
physics uh you have some pretty
interesting proposals there's a book
that I don't pretend to understand it
but published by the American physical
Society so I guess it's taken seriously
by a very well-known physicist I think
he died recently physicist at The
Institute for advanced study John
Wheeler who argues that the only thing
that exists in the world are bits of
information Nam answers to questions
that we pose to Nature that's all there
is everything else is some kind of
construct for those so you know from
that point of view all there is is
information you know it's apparently not
ridiculed by physicists so I'm not able
to ridicule
it and you understand what he means what
he's talking from the framework of
quantum theory which says this what's
there is our observations the questions
we pose to Nature and the answers it
gives back to us and those are just bits
of information everything else is
constructed from that it's a little bit
like say Edington and Russell you know
early 20s saying that all that really
exists is meter readings and everything
else is our construction from meter
readings so if physicists had the same
Illusions as
psychologists they would and
sociologists and others they might call
physics meter reading science the way
modern study of society and action is
sometimes is often called Behavioral
Science that's confusing the topic with
the data for it some of the data you
know you were talking about the limits
of understanding a little bit and um I
was watching a clip uh on YouTube I
believe it was in 1971 and you were
debating with a French philosopher which
is fuk I believe I don't remember and
you were debating about or his arguments
were more I guess that the social uh uh
limits that we impose ourselves are
something that needs to be taught and
needs to be enforced while you were
trying to say that it was something
inherently in the human uh mind to have
kindness and intelligence in order to be
like social my question is what what do
you think is our U limits for or to be
able to go in peace in a social context
and and start struggling I I I'm I'm I
believe in evolution so I think that
it's an evolution thing but I think your
philosophers are trying very very hard
to develop or to understand in order to
be um more social and peacefully
creatures yeah not just philosophers all
of us are in our ordinary lives raising
children whatever it may be there's no
real debate between I mean the debate
was not about the importance of social
factors of course they exist the debate
was about
what is taken to be contentious but
shouldn't be the existence of innate
factors that's very commonly denied and
Fuko in fact was denying it but it's
just incoherent to deny it If you deny
it then our cognitive and social
behavior would be like some you know
imagined organism if you can imagine one
uh that doesn't have any genetic program
that determines what kind of organism
it'll be and nothing that determines
that it'll be an insect or a a mouse or
a human or whatever and it therefore
will be nothing it'll be
some you know aoid style reflection of
accidental data uh a lot of scientists
have argued that philosophers too so
Quin for example famously uh I would say
infamously argu that uh language but it
would hold for he held it for all
behavior in fact all theories is just uh
the result of some it's a kind of an
accidental collection of behaviors
constructed by developed through
conditioning I mean it's essentially
like saying we're all amibas amibo not
even an amoeba because an amoeba has
internal structure it doesn't do it
doesn't make any sense you can't have
any structure in an organism unless
there's some form of predetermination
that form of predetermination will
provide scope it'll also impose limits
and there's just no way out of that
that's practically
logic but yes to try to become more
Humane creatures is not just
philosophers Quest it should be quest
for all of
us what are the determination what are
the um historical or scientifical U
factors determine the scope scope of our
understanding and can we assume that the
scope of our understanding have
progressed since say the ancient
times well as far as we know human
cognitive capacities have not changed
for at least 50,000 years uh when humans
are some small group of hunter gatherers
left Africa spread all over the world
were all their descendants I mean maybe
a little more complex than that but not
a lot lot more uh now we know that
pretty well for I mean like you know
it's not that anyone understands the
biological nature of it but there's very
strong evidence so for example if you
take a an infant from some tribe in
Papua New guine that hasn't had other
human contact for 40,000 years and
that's a possibility uh and you take
that infant and you bring it to Oslo and
raise it from infancy and Oslo it'll be
indistinguishable from the people
studying physics in Oslo
University uh it has the same cognitive
capacities and conversely you take a you
know an infant from here and put it in
that drive in Papa New Guinea it'll be
able to do all the complex cognitive
tasks that they can solve but that you
and I couldn't possibly solve we
couldn't survive there for a week so U
it looks from evidence like I me you
know from evidence like that which which
is maybe not conclusive but is certainly
powerful it seems that cognitive
capacities just haven't
changed in fact humans are genetically
very much alike as compared with other
species not and it's not surprising
because there's apparently a common
origin not very long ago 50,000 years is
nothing in evolutionary time it's a iink
so chances are that whatever the
cognitive capacities were 50,000 years
ago they still are of course they have
to be brought out like like other innate
capacities they have to be elicited by
experience but they're there you know
and I think that's you know hum wasn't
thinking about evolution of course but
when he talked about the common
faculties that are given by the original
hand of
nature I think must be what he meant I
mean these were real problems in the
17th the 18th century remember that at
the time of the early Scientific
Revolution that was also the time of the
first real
Explorations and explorers were finding
all sorts of creatures that didn't look
like
Europeans uh like Negroes and
orangutangs and so on and they weren't
sure how to distinguish them so which
ones are some of them human or not if
you're if you're a cartisian
rationalist uh there's 's a sharp
distinction between human and
non-human cartisian rationalism is
incompatible with racism it's a point
that historian philosophy Howard
Harold Harry Bracken has discussed at
length you can't be a rationalist and a
racist you either have a mind or you
don't have a mind and if you have a mind
it's the same there's only one you know
so that's it you can't empiricist on the
other hand could be racist because
there's uh there's you can have
different properties and these were
hotly debated issues in the 17th and
18th century they couldn't figure out
what those other creatures were were
they humans or weren't they if they were
did they have rights and if so what
rights and so on but of course that's
long past and now there's just humans
we're apparently essentially all
alike and what we could there could be a
study of what our common cognitive
capacities are in fact it's studied
quite a lot so when you study what the
way you say infants
determine
uh Contin the continuity of objects on
the basis of very scattered data you're
essentially asking the kinds of
questions that decart asked deart
actually people don't you know
unfortunately philosophers these days
tend only to read the
meditations but that's not theart in
fact that was kind of propaganda he even
pointed that out he the famous letter he
wrote to his friend maren where he said
that the point of the meditations is to
try to convince the Jesuits to take his
physic seriously that's what he really
cared about uh when he wrote principles
philosophy that means principles of
science that's the real stuff and in in
that work and in the Optics and other
things he posed very interesting
questions he didn't carry out the
experiments but he carried out thought
experiments very much the way Galileo
did uh and uh but they if you carried
them out they'd probably come out his
way so like one one was to ask the
question they said imagine an infant who
has had no experience with geometrical
figures okay uh which in fact is every
infant because geometrical figures don't
exist in nature just some other things
but uh so take an infant with no
experience with geometrical figures
present that infant with a triangle
drawn on paper he said what the infant
will
perceive is a distorted triangle not a
perfect instance of whatever crazy
figure it is you know with the two lines
not quite coming together one of them
somewhat curved and so on and he
regarded that as kind of paradoxical why
should that be true I if you're a thoing
empir empiricist you shouldn't permit
that conclusion in fact it's a since the
conclusion is almost certainly correct
it's a easy reputation of standard
empiricism uh and his conclusion
decart's conclusion was well we must
have some innate system of he would
assume ukian geometry which we impose
on data to yield our
understanding in fact their perception
and there's quite a lot of work in the
uh speculation through the 18th 17th
century on how this could be and basic
ideas are probably correct there's now a
lot of experimental work and uh with
infants and comparative work
investigating it and that is at the
beginnings of work trying to find out
what our cognitive capacities are
there's also work on U something like
rudimentary science for me uh how to
children develop a concept that the
world acts you know some rational
fashion a lot of this developed out of
P's work even though doesn't stand up as
it he presented it that kind of work has
been pursued and and that is I think the
study of what you're asking how far it
can go you know can it go up to what
kind of scientific theories we can
understand that's far off
if we um no longer consider materialism
as relevant but still we want to uh do
philosophy there should be an Endeavor
there should be a a
point um and um what should the Endeavor
of philosophy be then if it's is it pure
Consciousness is that what we are uh
exploring and and if so how do we go
about to explore those limits of
knowledge and and how do we practically
do that because many people propose for
instance that they can use psychedelic
substances and so are there some taboos
that are stopping us
from uh making that research that would
be leaving materialism behind and moving
on forward considering different aspects
of of our experience or whatever I'm not
sure
that well I don't think we can leave
materialism behind until somebody tells
us what materialism is i that's kind of
Elementary there was a concept of
materialism right through the early
Scientific
Revolution uh right through Newton
Newton still accepted it in fact the
great scientists of The Next Century
accepted it you know lron and others
kept trying to develop a material
mechanistic concept of the universe that
went right through the 19th century
ether theories and so so on it was
finally given up in the 20th century you
know finally recognized look we're never
going to get it uh and totally different
ways of looking at things were developed
which have no relation to traditional
materialism fredrich longa is correct so
since and nobody's ever suggested
another notion it materialism just is
like anything we more or less understand
it includes thinking it includes
reasoning and so on and so forth block
suggestion so we can't leave it behind
behind unless someone tells it what it
is but there's no reason why we can't we
can't study it I we can study what
the human capacity of understanding is
in fact we know some things about it we
know some negative things for example we
can't understand the way the world works
because our concept of understanding is
too limited to incorporate what nton
described as an absurdity you know
people like Newton and Hume and lock not
idiots we have to take them seriously uh
they regarded it as an absurdity for
very good reasons and U modern cognitive
science which somehow tries to
recapitulate some of this finds pretty
much that so as I mentioned an
infant presented with
presentations which indicate that
there's some kind of causality like you
know when the ball rolls this way light
turns red or something they will invent
a mechanical cause and they don't care
if it's not visible because infants
understand that most of what goes on is
invisible you know but there's got to be
some mechanical cause otherwise no way
for it to influence anything else so
that does seem to be the way our minds
work and that tells us something about
the limits of our understanding in fact
a classical crucial case and it can go
on to other cases um so uh U and and we
can study it directly in principle we
can study it directly it's not simple I
mean it's not easy to understand why a
rat can't understand can't deal with a
prime number maze even that's hard I we
have good evidence it's true but why
it's true is unclear nothing known about
the brains of rats that explains why
they can't do that in fact we can't
explain why uh say uh the tiniest
organism that's seriously studied C
elegant
nematodes 800 cells 300 neurons entire
wiring diagram known there been years of
study trying to explain why this thing
it goes left instead of right let's say
it's just we don't know how to explain
that it's a is an answer but these are
hard scientific questions when you talk
about how human intelligence works it's
incomparably more difficult so you can
you can ask the questions you can
you know cut away at them but we
shouldn't uh we shouldn't exaggerate
it's kind of striking that going back to
what philosophy ought to do philosophers
often appear to intend to want to get
answers about humans that we can't get
about
insects and that's too much you know uh
science sort of works at the edges of
understanding and it faces hard
questions all the way uh so we can sort
of talk about it but um if you want to
seriously work on it you have to take a
look at what is understood and uh try
see if you can formulate questions which
will which are can be investigated and
will tell us more about What's
Understood actually there's interesting
work going on on this having to do with
things like U the mor the human moral
Instinct in the past 20 30 years that's
become an experimental subject with
interesting experimental work on
universal probably Universal moral
principles
a very important book just came out
couple of weeks ago by uh John mik he's
a philosopher who's now teaches law at
Georgetown
University who gives a very acute he
moress initiated this modern study
didn't publish much but other people
have drawn off his work a combination of
reanalysis of traditional moral
philosophy mainly roles and his
antecedants and uh an analysis A lot of
the critique of roles and and then on to
developing experimental programs to
investigate some of these questions and
it's feasible maybe we can get some
insight into innate human moral Concepts
that
are that are cross-cultural like you
want to find them in every culture and
that you can find with young children
the pre any serious cultural impact
those are all
things that can be studied and there's
beginnings of
studies I was wondering what do you
think about the prospects of uh genetic
engineering and how that might perhaps
uh expand our cognitive abilities and uh
thereby maybe um also expanding the
scope of what we're able to
understand well in order to carry out
genetic engineering you have to
understand something about the genetics
of the trait that you're trying to deal
with so if you know Monsanto wants
to genetically
engineer U say rice that'll be immune to
some kind of disease they have to
understand something about what in the
genetics of rice uh yields the the you
know the susceptibility to disease when
we talk about human understanding we
have a clue what the genetics are so you
just can't even begin to ask a question
I mean that raises the an ethical
question should we even try if if we did
know but that ethical question is pretty
far off in the distance because the
genetics of it aren't understood I mean
my own professional work is mostly on
language and even in the case of
language which is a small part of our
cognitive capacity kind of a central
part but a small part nobody has any
idea what very little idea what the
genetics are it's obviously there you
can see its consequences but to try to
find it is very hard and as I said
questions like that are not easy to
answer about the insects or tiny
worms would you say that the search for
these So-Cal particles carriers of of um
influence like the hix boson and the
photon is that a search for a path back
to contact action and therefore
mechanical philosophy I'm sorry I didn't
understand search for the photon return
to the to the of contact the the
photon for the hios oh the
Hixon well you know there there's a
slight problem in physics they can't
find 90% of what the universe is made up
of but you know doesn't mean an end to
physics you just look harder and what
they're searching for is the higs bosan
which is supposed to be there and if it
is there it can account for why
particles have mass other hence energy
otherwise just can't account for it I
mean it's just assumed either it's there
or something different from the standard
models correct uh but you know until
it's found you can't ask whether you
can't say whether it exists or whether
the standard model that presupposes it
is wrong that's a very Live question
they're spending billions of dollars
trying to answer it and
Switzerland CERN things like United
States has always given up on that
Quest Congress won't fund
it hi um my name is Timothy Chen I'm uh
postto uh here at
csmn okay yes um okay so um Professor
tomsky you you mentioned that you
thought it's a legitimate scientific
project to investigate where the limit
of human understanding l so whether
question is um beyond our ability to
answer um I just wonder what what kind
of uh uh evidence or inquiry do you
think would be relevant to that so so so
just an example um you in philosophy uh
colen mcin holds the view that um the
nature of Consciousness uh or the
expanish Gap that's something that you
know human beings are just never going
to be able to ask answer and um I guess
there's some some Affinity between his
position and what you say but then an
objection to him that I'm sympathetic to
you said well how how do you know we
cannot know um you how do you know that
if you you give human beings 10,000
years suppose suppose that we haven't
gone extend by that how do you know that
you give 10,000 years people aren't
going to come up with new Concepts that
they don't now have so so how do you
know that that they are not going to be
able to solve it so um so I yeah so I
just wonder if you uh you think you
think there's a scientific uh evidence
for this question what kind of evidence
what would that be well first of all
we're talking about empirical questions
and in the case of empirical questions
you never know with certainty that's
what makes some empirical questions
otherwise they'd be questions of logic
or maybe arithmetic uh even there you
can ask questions but uh if it's
empirical we we we're never going to
know with certainty that's for sure it's
true by definition uh so the question
really is what evidence do we have and
how good is the evidence well in some
cases the evidence is pretty good I like
take the classical case what Newton
regarded as an absurdity and again I
think you have to take people like
Newton seriously you know and Hume and
Hans and the rest of them uh what they
regarded as an absurdity is that there
could be influence without contact and I
while we don't know with certainty that
that's the limits of human intelligence
there's pretty good evidence uh if you
study first of all we we just have it
from our own intuitions and from uh you
know the the history of centuries
of efforts by the leading scientists to
try to do to overcome it finally ending
in failure and abandoning the quest and
we also know it or beginning understand
it from just the experimental study of
infants children things of the kind that
I mentioned they
reflexively seek some kind of contact in
order to account for
correlations doesn't make sense
otherwise well pH physicists have
finally given that up they say look
we're never going to find it it doesn't
exist but is how strong is that evidence
well you decide how strong it is looks
pretty compelling to me and if it if it
is really the limits of our
understanding then nothing's going to
change in 10,000 years just as it didn't
change in the last
50,000 uh what about things beyond that
well you
know it's not an easy question to ask
even about other creatures like rats but
you can investigate it are you ever
going to get certainty no you'll never
have certainty because it's an empirical
investigation so that you don't bother
looking for as far as Consciousness is
concerned I it's a very hot topic these
days in fact in philosophy it's called
the hard problem everything else is an
easy problem Som but this is the hard
problem now you go back to the 17th and
18th century they also had something
called the hard problem namely how is
motion possible that was the hard
problem um I mentioned you know Newton
wrestled with it finally said it's
impossible possible we just have to
accept it even though we can't find what
he called a physical cause uh that was
called the Hard Rock in
philosophy voler you know dedicated
Newtonian said that the fact that humans
can cause motion by thought and like I
can think I want my hand to go over here
and something will move he said that's
so inexplicable that it's got to be
divine intervention he was of course a
pretty dedicated atheist by the
standards of the time uh but
uh it looks as if we're stuck with that
and there seem to be if we look further
there are many other many other things I
mean take say language which is easier
to study um there are impossible
languages you can
construct thing you know things that
look you know symbol sequences which are
given interpretations and so on but
which have a structure that humans
cannot
learn I mean they may deal with it as a
puzzle of some kind but they can't deal
with it as a linguistic task there's by
now pretty good experimental data on
that well that's the kind of thing you
expect to find when you look at any
organism including our cogn other
cognitive capacities as far as
Consciousness is concerned you know I'm
not so convinced that it's the hard
problem first of all you have to
formulate it coherently what's the
problem I mean I quoted Francis cck I
didn't mention him as saying that uh he
has an astonishing hypothesis that
Consciousness comes from activity of the
brain that's lock you know Hume I me yes
they took that for granted uh so that's
the astonishing hypothesis and then you
can go to proceed as he and others have
done to ask what's going on in the brain
when people are conscious okay that's
serious work does it answer the suppose
you could get all those questions
answered does it tell you what
Consciousness is no leaves open the
questions of Consciousness and in fact
you know we might ultimately be reduced
to something like what Bertrand Russell
thought you read his analysis of matter
for example which unfortunately isn't
read much but it's important I think I
think it's 1928 or so he says uh he says
look the only thing we have any
confidence in is our immediate
Consciousness it we may be wrong about
it but at least we have some degree of
con confidence in it everything else is
a mental is intellectual construction
including our conception of objects our
theory of the world and so on so that's
if you want the Hard Rock not too hard
because it could be wrong but uh that's
what we have to start with and uh it's
the best you can do as
humans okay your political ideas um uh
they have a foundation on ethics yeah H
ethics morality and then I want to ask
you uh how is morality
compatible with
um limited limited mind determined human
as you put it if I understood you well
uh because in a limited mind and DET
minded human I don't see a place for the
Free Will which is the base of uh
morality in the human world so what you
think about it about Free Will and
morality which is of course the base of
politics and
uhal yeah social human moral principles
we can
study like the kind of work that I
mentioned John M others uh are carrying
out the beginnings of experimental work
which sheds light on and may ultimately
shed a lot of light on what our innate
moral principles are what Hume was
looking for for example and Adam Smith
and others that could shed some light on
it so I don't think it's going to tell
you much about freedom of the will
freedom of the will I think we're stuck
pretty much where dekart was we just
can't abandon believing it it's our most
immediate phenomenologically obvious
impression but we can't explain it and
as he said if there's something which we
just know to be true and we don't have
any explanation for it well too bad for
our explanatory uh possibilities but uh
I don't see any way of getting around
that I there's a lot of arguments that
we don't have freedom of the will and
those arguments there's a ton of
literature on that and the literature is
kind of interesting actually for reasons
that William James discussed he said if
you believe that there's no freedom of
the
will why bother presenting an argument
uh you're just you're forced to do it
the person you're talking to can't be
convinced because there's no such thing
as reasons so why not watch a baseball
game that wasn't his example but you
know anybody who denies Freedom the will
actually believes that it's there
otherwise they wouldn't bother
presenting reasons I mean unless they
say look I'm just forced to present the
I can't do anything else but these
reasons yeah and it's very very odd
these discussion many of them actually
you may have seen some experimental work
which caused a big flurry a couple of
years ago some
neurophysiologists discovered that uh uh
if a if a person's going to carry an
active will action let's say you know
pick this up say there's you can find
activity in the motors's centers of the
brain before there's a decision to pick
it up okay and that was held to show
okay we've undermined freedom of the
will it doesn't say anything all it says
is what we ought to know anyway
decisions are mostly made
unconsciously by the time they reach the
level of Consciousness they've probably
already been made but that doesn't tell
anything about how decisions are
made but you didn't answer me I at least
I didn't uh realized I didn't uh
perceive that I got an answer of is it
compatible your
um teaching about determined genetical
determined
humans and uh ethics political ethics
morality and Free Will that is what I
ask is it compatible or comp it's
incompatible and unexplainable you said
it's unexplainable I don't understand
why belief in certain ethical principles
should be inconsistent with the belief
that we have an ability to make choices
in fact they seem totally consistent
maybe it's all wrong but they're
consistent if if somebody's determined
one cannot take a choice that is that is
the seems like that's the base of I
didn't I don't understand what the
alleged inconsistency
is in fact it's more like what you what
I thought you said before that moral the
commitment to moral principles basically
presupposes freedom of the
will but I don't see any
inconsistency she attributed it some
belief in genetic determinism to you but
you haven't committed to anything like
yeah genetic there's genetic determinism
of course that's why I'm that's why
we're all humans and not insects because
that's our genetic endowment that's
genetic determinism just what follows
from it you know you have to look and
see we don't know
uh my question relates to the previous
question actually um free will you know
as a philosopher I'd like to well you as
a philosopher I'd like to to ask you
this question
um you know Studies have shown that
decisions made in the brain actually
Pierce some moments before an individual
experiences
them um well how can you then say that
there is such a thing as free will I
mean thus wiring determinism you know it
proves that Free Will basically doesn't
exist yeah those are the experiments I
was just referring to there are some
experiments which show that in a will
action simple willed motor action you
know picking something up there is
activity and the relevant parts of the
motor cortex before the decision to pick
it up is
conscious okay that tells us absolutely
nothing about freedom of the will except
that it's
choices are probably unconscious but I
think we know that without the
experiments
what complicated oh yeah anything in
this area is very when we understand
nothing everything's
complicated it's another
truism you do seem to imply that the
theories of uh physics and chemistry are
in some way constructs of our own
imagination and I wouldn't very much
agree to that but you also seem to imply
some uh that they can be deconstructed
in some way into in biology they can be
deconstructed into the neurobiology of
our brains but what gives you the
confidence that our scientific method is
our science is one our scientific method
scientific method is uh what what gives
you enough confidence in the scientific
me method to believe the evidence that
biology uh give uh gives us that seems
to be some um innate skepticism in that
system of thought and uh to me it's I I
would rather end up believing in no no
nothing at all not even that we do not
believe anything than actually uh
believing in our own limitations
so if we are so if we are so
fundamentally limited as you claim we
are how can we have any confidences in
the evidences Pro providing the fact
that we are limited a pure
skeptic you can give no answers to which
means that they're not asking sensible
questions uh we're only interested in
sensible questions the kind to which you
can even imagine an answer maybe a wrong
answer but if you can't even imagine an
answer it may have the form of a
question but it's not a question like
for example if you were to ask uh why do
things happen Okay that happens have the
structure of an interrogative sentence
but it has no answers no no even
imaginable answers so therefore it's not
a question just as the structure of an
interrogative the pure skeptic if one
Can Be Imagined is posing things that
look like questions but aren't really as
to how you can have confidence
first of all you never have complete
confidence if it's if it's an empirical
issue in fact you know even even
arithmetic you can't have complete
conscious I me it's known you know you
can have non-standard models of
arithmetic which satisfy the axioms but
are different and so on so but in
empirical questions you develop conent
Confidence from experience intuition
experiment and so on What's called the
scientific method but that's a funny
term because there really is nothing
that's the scientific method like when
you take say a psychology
course program you do take a course in
methodology but when you study Physics
you don't take a course in
methodology there's no method other than
being reasonable you know uh and the
learning from what has been done and see
if you can carry it forward and so on in
fact the courses in methodology that you
take say in Psychology are sociology are
mostly courses and statistics and
techniques you can use but scientific
method is you just whatever way we have
of dealing with the world rationally
reasonably can we have confidence in it
no maybe it's misleading us just as rats
are consistently being misled about
mazes we can understand it for them but
if that's true all we can do is try to
see if we can use the same rational
approaches to see if we can figure out
what the limits of our uh uh
intellectual capacities are and we have
some examples in which I think can have
Fair confidence like the collapse of uh
the intuitive intuitively obvious fact
that that Mo interaction requires
contact I don't know much about physics
so I'm going to ask this like simple
simply and maybe you already answered
this um do you reject the possibility of
a non physical reality interacting with
this physical
reality
um uh and you like acknowledge it the
possibility of it through seeing the
effects uh it might have on the physical
reality I'm thinking of like um the
study of like the smallest entities of
an atom and
um yeah and also just the power of
Attraction what is it well the two of us
share something I don't understand
physics either so that so we're in the
same but and in fact I don't think
physicists understand it and they're
pretty open about it but uh uh but you
see you can't ask the question
about interaction between physical and
non-physical until you tell us what
physical
means okay you've at least got to be
able to tell us what physical means in
order for the question to be answered
but there hasn't been any concept of
physical for hundred hundreds of years
um there was one in the early Scientific
Revolution a very intuitive concept of
the physical that's what inspired
Galileo
Dart liet Newton lron you know many
others all throughout the modern history
of science but it's been recogn but it
was already recognized after Newton that
it's gone like Lo recognized it Hume
recognized it for Hume it's not a gone
it's a total mystery beyond our
intellectual capacities and uh that we
can speculate about but it's certainly
gone and no one has proposed anything
else the physical these days are things
that Newton would have regarded as total
absurdities like curved SpaceTime how
can that be physical quantum
entanglement I mean Einstein regarded
that as non-physical because it's so
absurd uh but you know now scientists
just accept it uh physical is just
anything we more or less understand and
if that's the the only notion of
physical we have there can't be uh
interaction between physical and
non-physical non-physical will be all
the things just all the things we don't
understand if we ever get to understand
them they'll be
physical I think that we're getting very
close to 6:00 I think we should call
this to end by thanking professor John
