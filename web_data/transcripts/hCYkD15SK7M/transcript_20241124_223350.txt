and
plenty of suffering and there were
images that that kind of stick in my
mind you know people coming to my
parents were teachers so we had some
money you know not rich but got along
and in fact the whole family of
unemployed working class kind of
converged around the around our house we
had
at least something
but there were images of people coming
to the door
trying to sell rags to try to get a
piece of bread to survive
I remember riding with my mother on
trolley cars
up watching and going past textile
plants this is Philadelphia and watching
women on strike being brutally beaten by
Security Forces I my own family was
extended family was mostly unemployed
working class and as I mentioned very
high culture as the New Deal sort of
began to have an impact they were able
to enjoy Shakespeare plays in the park
go to the boot with a string quartet to
my unemployed seamstress ants who were
members of the ilgwoo you know ladies
garment Workers Union couldn't get a
couple of weeks in the countryside at a
solidarity camp that that was life a lot
of it was Communist Party we're not
allowed to say anything nice about the
Communist party that's a rule and there
were a lot of things wrong with it and
I've mentioned some of them but there
were things that were right about it
like a sip one was that it overcame the
Amnesia that Nathan talked about it was
always there you know people remembered
somebody remembered how to turn the mini
graph machine or organize a
demonstration then you went from a civil
rights demonstration to a labor
organizing to something else that crazy
International ideas but that that was
kind of in the back of their minds it
wasn't what was really going on the
destruction of the the Communist party
was quite important killed off the
radical continuing
element that kept a lot of the left
Traditions going uh you know the reasons
it was in the Cold War framework that
was all there as far as the anarchists
were concerned the place I learned about
that was by reading
I went when I was a kid I'd go to visit
my relatives and as soon as I got old
enough to get on the train about 11 or
12 years old and take the train to New
York and stay with my relatives but
spend most of my time down on if those
of you know New York
Union Square used to be the place where
the anarchist offices were that's why I
arbite their stemma others and lots of
pamphlets lots of interesting people
very quite eager to talk to a young kid
you know so not hard to have discussions
and down below Union Square on 4th
Avenue
not today but then there were rows of
small bookstores a lot of them run by
European emigries many of them Spanish
refugees Spanish Anarchist refugees who
are also quite eager to talk and had
lots of pamphlets and the direct you
know a real original documentary
material actually when I wrote about
this 20 years later I used mostly
documentary material I had picked up as
a young teenager it wasn't available a
lot of it's available now it wasn't then
and that was a pretty inspiring picture
I felt the Spanish Revolution at least I
felt on the field was a really inspiring
moment which I think is why it elicited
such a vicious response from every
corner of power
quite important to remember
Communists fascists liberal democracies
all combined on crushing this this was
something they couldn't tolerate then
they could have a fight later about who
picks up the spoils actually there were
Anarchist proposals that I felt were not
unreasonable they're disparaged of
course in the west but for how to win
the civil war was Anarchist sinkers like
Camilo berneri who was murdered by the
Communists in May 1937 one of the
leading Anarchist thinkers he he
proposed that he he pointed out I think
as it turned out quite correctly that
they'd never win a conventional War for
one reason because the commitment to the
war on the part of the population had
seriously declined After the Revolution
was crushed they had lost what they had
fought for and they didn't care very
much who was going to pick up the spoils
he pointed out and
and of course the fascists were being
directly supported by
by Hitler Mussolini and the West
was not opposed to that
it's hard you may forget now but the
fascism had a pretty good image in the
West in the late 30s
Mussolini was that admirable Italian
gentleman as Roosevelt called him Hitler
was regarded by the state department as
in the late 30s as a moderate who was
holding off the forces of left and right
so we shouldn't be too critical of him
the United States had a Consul in Berlin
up until Pearl Harbor who was sending
back
dispatches saying you shouldn't be too
hard on the Nazis or doing some things
we don't like but they're still kind of
moderate his name is George Kennan you
don't read that in the biographies but
that's not untypical of the period that
Roosevelt for example
bitter there was a Neutrality Act
theoretically
the the United States was not supposed
to allow support for either side in the
Civil War and Roosevelt was very bitter
about any attempt to by somebody to say
send a pistol to The Republic I couldn't
stop it by force but he bitterly
condemned it on the other hand the state
department couldn't notice what I was
reading in the left-wing press at the
time and was later conceded 20 years
later that the United States had
authorized the Texaco oil company which
was run by an outright Nazi open Nazi
had authorized them to change they were
they had a contracts to ship oil to The
Republic they switched it to shipping
oil to the fascist forces
which is the one thing that Hitler and
the Cellini couldn't provide they
couldn't find that the left press
confines but the state department
couldn't well going back to bernary what
he proposed was that in Spain itself
the popular forces should fight a
guerrilla War that's an old Spanish
tradition in fact that's where Guerrilla
Wars and it were initiated under
Napoleon despite a guerrilla war in
Spain itself and in Morocco
call for support the Moroccan Liberation
forces that were trying to free
themselves from French and British
Imperial and Spanish imperial control
that was the base of Franco's Army there
were Moorish troops coming from Northern
Africa so his idea was fight a
revolutionary war and support them in
their efforts to overthrow imperialist
control that he thought would erode the
Spanish the fascist armies just as in
Spain itself the popular forces were
fighting but until they were crushed
well that's if you read the scholarship
on on the matter up till today that's
kind of dismissed as a sort of a
romantic joke as the whole Anarchist
movement is but I don't think it was
that's worth that was my initial
exposure to it
