most of the ipcc's climate mitigation
scenarios would deploy
uh carbon capture technologies to mop up
excess emissions
some of the most widely discussed
methods um
would uh consume vast quantities of
biomass produced on hundreds of millions
or billions
of acres and thereby threatening
ecosystems and food production
and a lot of this
would be happening in uh low-income
low-emissions
nations a group of
18 ethicists and other scholars wrote
earlier this year
now that a core principle of climate
justice is that quote the urgent basic
needs of poor people in poor countries
ought to be secured against both the
effects of climate change and
of measures that are taken to limit
climate change
that would clearly rule out these um
emit carbon now capture it later plans
it would seem
and there are other examples of what we
might call climate mitigation
imperialism that are the kind of
technology we should not be
um
using uh do you think the world could be
faced with more and more of this sort of
exploitation as temperatures rise and
what do you what do you think about
these um
carbon capture like
bio energy and carbon storage
i mean of course it's totally immoral
but we should recognize that it's
standard practice
we do it all the time
where does our waste go
doesn't go in my backyard
goes to places like haiti
places that can't protect themselves
and there's even an argument for it
it goes it's much worse take somalia
somalia has
turned into a wreck
what we call terrorists pirates and so
on
a large part of it is the fault of the
european union
they've been dumping their
atomic wastes
other
pollution off the coast of somalia
not in their backyard off the coast of
somalia
uh
destroying the fishing areas
destroying the local industries so that
people turn to piracy
then we accuse them of terrorism
okay
there's even an argument for it a famous
argument by a famous economist
lauren summers
uh
when he was i think he was then
chief economist of the world bank if i
remember put out a memo
in which he
argued that
it makes good
economic sense
to send
waste products poisonous waste products
to the poorest countries
because if you do
straight economic analysis
you
estimate each individual's
capital
how much they're worth
how much they could produce how much
they could increase gdp
then for people in the rich countries
their capital is much greater than
people in the poor countries
so by elementary economic reasoning
maximizing
gdp
so on it makes perfect sense we should
be sending all the waste to poison the
poor people
well had an interesting history that
memo
when it came out
a lot of people were horrified
uh economists ran away and say oh that's
not us
it is them
he was following their principles
nothing wrong with it he later claimed
well it was just a joke
but it follows exact economic principles
follows neoliberal principles
you know the standard neoclassical
arguments perfectly what's the problem
there's a problem
but we have to locate where that problem
is
i'll tell you an anecdote if we have a
minute
i learned
about
neoliberal doctrine from
the
ultimate master the guru
ludwig von mises
when i was a graduate student at harvard
he came to deliver a lecture this is 75
years ago
for a couple of friends of mine and i
went to the lecture
the lecture was interesting he gave a
reasoned argument about the evils of the
government
for example in causing unemployment
that's a very straightforward argument
suppose
some guy is
practically starving
and
i offer him a job rotten job under
dangerous conditions for
a dollar an hour let's say
well he would like to take it but then
the evil government steps in
and imposes standards of
that you have to meet in a workplace
and
minimum minimum wages and all sorts of
other intrusions into sound economics
so that he causes
we can't make this free current contract
between us free contract of course
that's what you are if you're a
libertarian and we force unemployment on
the population
it was interesting to look at the
audience
harvard students
part of the audience said that's really
good and good argument i agree
they're the part that went on to become
corporate lawyers
ceos
libertarian enthusiasts and so on
another part of the audience photo was
utterly appalling
they went in a different direction
well
they're the ones who became
freedom writers in the south
environmental activists and so on
we have those choices but let's when we
talk about
what you just described
imposing the costs
of
in a limited way cleaning up the
atmosphere imposing those costs on the
poor and the vulnerable
we're following
consistent long-term policies
which have been pursued without
objection
and are rooted
in sound economics
what's called sound economics okay
these are all things we're thinking
about
so of course we shouldn't do it it's
horrendous
and there's a history that we should
think about as well
quite apart from the fact
that these measures
uh have very little promise
of dealing with the crisis that we're
facing dealing with crisis means
following
the prescriptions of
virtually unanimous prescriptions of
scientists
latest ibcc report
beginning right now
to remove fossil fuels
other destructive acts in the
environment
taking steps so that within a couple of
decades
we can hope to
reach a sustainable economy
we don't do that
it's not that everyone's going to die
tomorrow
we will reach irreversible tipping
points
meanwhile
the people most vulnerable
least responsible for the crisis are
already suffering severely
people living in the
plains of bangladesh for example
where destructive cyclone comes and
low-lying planes and causes
extraordinary damage
people living in
india
where the temperature can go up to
50 degrees celsius in summer
they don't have air conditioning
i could survive that they can't you know
this is happening right now
it's not just our floods and droughts
and so on that a rich country can
sort of manage temporarily
much worse
large parts of the world may become
literally unlivable
there were recently reports by
israeli geoscientists
bitterly condemning the government for
not
taking account of the effect of
the policies they're pursuing
and
developing an analysis which
indicated that within a couple of
decades
over the summer the mediterranean
would be reaching
the heat of a jacuzzi
and the
low-lying plains
would be inundated
people could still live in jerusalem and
ramallah but much of the rest of the
country be underwater
telling them you're insane
we know how to stop this why are you
racing towards disaster
by developing new
gas fields
in the uh
in the mediterranean
it's all over you know
yeah
um
okay uh uh one last thing if you um have
time it seems
that the the larry summers um sort of
world view and
neoliberals is uh
especially lives on in
the
economic climate models known as
integrated assessment models which they
basically come down to
cost benefit analysis
based on the so-called social cost of
carbon for
in
now and in subsequent decades which
is discounted as you get further further
in decades
which would uh seem to me to be another
uh
example of a bad gamble that uh henry
schuh
um talked about um
what role are they playing and it seems
like a lot of decisions
being based on those
we have no right to gamble
with the lives of the
people in south asia
in africa
plains of
bangladesh you don't have any right to
gamble with them not their lives or the
people in poor communities in the united
states
you want to do something in your
academic seminar
okay go ahead
but don't
dare to translate it into policy
don't dare to do that in fact there's a
striking difference
between physicists
the profession
and economists
i mean physicists don't say hey let's
try to
experiment which might uh destroy the
world because it's interesting to see
what would happen
actually economists do that
on the basis of
economic theories
neoclassical theories
they instituted
a major
revolution in world affairs in the early
1980s
took off
with carter accelerated under reagan and
thatcher
given the power of the united states
spread to the rest of the world
the neoliberal assault
a major
experiment
with economic theories
which
perfectly predictably
had a devastating result
it wasn't good enough to take a genius
to figure it out
i mean the motto is
government is the problem
government is the problem doesn't mean
you eliminate decisions it means you
transfer them
decisions still have to be made
if they're not made by government which
is
in a limited way under popular influence
they'll be made by concentrations of
private power
which have no accountability of the
public
and following
the friedman instructions
have no
responsibility to the society that gave
them the gift of incorporation they have
only the responsibility of
self-enrichment
comes along margaret thatcher
there's no society
just atomized individuals
uh somehow managing on the market
of course there was a small footnote
which he didn't bother to add
for the rich and powerful there's plenty
of society
organizations
business roundtable
alec all kinds of others they get
together they defend themselves and so
on so plenty of society for them just
not for the rest of you
you face the ravages of the market and
of course the rich don't
they count on a powerful state
to bail them out every time there's in
trouble
so they are the strongest advocates the
libertarians of a very powerful state
which intervenes massively every time
they get into trouble to bail them out
to give them a
tacit insurance policy
called too big to fail
which allows them to get credit
cheaply to make risky moves which will
be profitable gives them all kind of
advantages have to have the powerful
state
let alone its police powers to ensure
that nobody gets in the way
so yes let's have a powerful state for
ourselves
big organizational structure for
ourselves but the rest of the population
uh
caused them out to make out somehow
but surprised that you end up with
50 trillion dollars of robbery which is
probably about half the actual number
when you add other things
how could it be a surprise there's a
surprise that
real wages for
non-supervisory workers are
about what they were 40 years ago
surprised that much of the population is
living a precarious life when they can
barely get by from payday to payday
it's unpredictable they predictable
you're going to destroy the environment
yeah
the easy
prove that in elementary school but
nevertheless let's try the experiment
because
and plenty of people gain for it from it
so in the united states
the top
0.1 of the population
has doubled its wealth share
from 10 to 20
well
those happen to be the people who
pay off to a mansion
who
by congress
who
own the republican party
much of the democrats
sure they gain fine great success
yeah
well i uh
can't thank you enough for
spending
an hour with me i really
it's been
it's been wonderful
i don't know if you have any uh
parting words uh
for this piece or um
party words are
young
when they say you betrayed us
they're right
and it's not over
i don't have many years others of you do
there's plenty that we can do and we
have to do it quickly and expeditiously
that's
uh absolutely right
well um once again i really appreciate
it and and thank you for all
the all that you're doing
thank you
let me reciprocate what you're doing is
amazingly important
well thank you thanks so much that means
a lot
see you later
