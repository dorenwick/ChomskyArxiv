Welcome, friends, to another edition 
of Economic Update, a weekly program  
devoted to the economic dimensions of 
our lives. I'm your host, Richard Wolff.
Today's program we’ll be talking about the strike 
by United States railroad workers that's being  
developed as we speak. We're going to 
talk about the Chipotle Corporation  
closing those restaurants where workers 
are organizing and fighting for unions  
and beginning to talk about strikes. 
Other issues as well, and then the  
second half we'll have an interview with the 
one and only Noam Chomsky. So, let me begin.
Railroad workers last struck in the United 
States back in 1991, so we're talking about  
30 years during which there hasn't been a 
job action of the kind we call a “strike”  
by this group of important workers. 
And I want to talk about them, - not  
only because they haven't struck, - but 
because these are better-paid workers,  
at least as the wages go in the United States, 
and they're becoming an important force,  
striking and unionizing, too. It's not just 
important as that is, it's not just the workers  
at Starbucks or Amazon that we've been hearing 
so much about, but it's all through the labor  
movement, all through the different categories 
of work, that workers are becoming more militant,  
demanding better conditions, not tolerating 
what they might have tolerated for a long time.
Railroad workers are overwhelmingly male, 
- many of them are former military, - and,  
relative to other workers, they're 
pretty well paid. The mean conductor,  
the average conductor salary, - about 
$68,000. The average engineer salary, $73,000.  
With benefits and so on. It's a considerable pay 
package, but it isn't enough for these workers,  
and there are very good reasons why, but 
before I tell you that, I want to make sure  
everybody understands that if the last 30 years 
were a problem, the last five were extreme.
The period of leading up to the pandemic, the 
pandemic, the crash, the inflation, they put a  
cap on a deteriorating situation, and clearly took 
this group of workers over the edge in terms of  
what they tolerate. How do I know that? Because 
when they voted on whether or not to strike  
in the middle of July of this year, the vote in 
favor of striking was 99% of those who voted.
The two biggest freight rail companies 
in this country, BNSF and Union Pacific,  
both had wonderful years in 2021. It might 
have been a pandemic of horrible proportions  
in the first half, and it might 
have added a horrible inflation  
in the second, but the railroad freight companies 
did well: $6 Billion in profits for BNSF, - was  
up 16% from 2020, - and Union Pacific with 
$6.5 Billion in profit, was likewise up 16%  
in 2021 compared to the year before. So, the 
companies were doing great at the same time  
that the pandemic, the crash, and the inflation 
was really walloping the workers, and they won't  
stand for it. The last time they struck, in 
1991, the strike only lasted 24 hours before  
Congress ordered, and the workers obeyed, going 
back to work. We will see what happens this time.
Ten unions are involved. The leader is the 
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and  
Trainmen. Over the last five years the number 
of jobs we're talking about fell from 125,000  
to 100,000. That's one measure of how bad 
the situation got. Over the same period,  
the increase in fatalities among these workers was 
60%. Accidents and injuries went up 9.4%. The work  
got harder, the work got more dangerous, but the 
pay didn't get a lot better. Meanwhile, pandemic  
justified weird schedules, - good for the company, 
not for the workers, - and then the inflation.
President Biden has the right and is expected 
to appoint a three-person commission to “cool  
things off”, as they say, until September. 
But this is a strike of people who are saying  
“we want better conditions”, “we want better  
accommodation to us”, just like everybody 
else in a long-suffering working class.
My next update has to do with a shift in American 
politics. You know, the big corporations,  
having been able to kind of stymie the federal 
government, between the Republicans and the  
Democrats, and back-and-forth, very little gets 
done up there, as most of you have noticed.  
And what is beginning to happen is that the labor 
movement demanding the way these railroad workers  
are, the kind of attention and the kind of support 
they should have been getting for a long time,  
are beginning to shift their focus away from 
a blocked, unable to act federal government.  
They're going lower, and not to the States 
but to the municipalities, - a stunning recent  
activity exemplified when the city of Los Angeles 
passed a special group of ordinances governing  
restaurant and other workers in Los Angeles, 
improving their pay, improving their job security.  
There, there was an alliance between a progressive  
machine in the local city and its supporters 
and the labor movement, and they got the kind  
of progressive legislation that the government 
in Washington is blocked from doing one way  
or another. And there's a lesson there for 
progressives and the Labor movement. If you get  
together, you may be able to do at the municipal 
level all kinds of things that are not available  
with the power of money concentrated, as it 
is, on the Federal and State governments.
My next update has to do with this Chipotle chain. 
The Chipotle chain, as I'm sure many of you know,  
is all over the country, and recently in 
Augusta, Maine, a union effort got underway,  
as is happening elsewhere, and it really got into 
high gear. The workers there went for a union.  
And once they showed that they have the majority 
support, the Chipotle did a very interesting  
thing: it closed its outlet in Augusta, Maine. The 
leaders of the strike and the human unionization  
effort there have already filed two unfair 
labor practice complaints, with the NLRB,  
and we will watch how those come out. 
There are other Chipotle efforts: Lansing,  
Michigan is one well-known where they're going 
to be unionizing, and Flushing, Queens in New  
York City, is another one. This is according to 
the lawyer for the union efforts, Jeffrey Young.
And I want to point out there's good reason to 
believe that the workers need unions. Let me  
give you an example. In the year 2020, two 
years ago, the office of Attorney General  
Maura Healey, - that's in the state of 
Massachusetts, - explains that Chipotle's more  
than 50 corporate-owned Massachusetts outlets had 
an estimated, - and get this, - 13,253 child labor  
violations, and other state wage and labor law 
violations, just in the four years from 2015  
to 2019. Examples included a minor working past 
midnight, - that's not legal in Massachusetts,  
- and 16- and 17-year old employees working beyond 
the nine-hour daily limit, and the 48-hour weekly  
limit. That's right, Chipotle ripping off the 
young people who work there in large numbers.
I want to address this retaliation by the 
corporations, when they're caught like this  
and when the workers act like this, forming 
a union, so they can't be abused like this.  
The Chipotle company closes the store. At that 
point, of course, the risk is workers will be  
without a job. They'll go find 
another job, they'll move out of town,  
they'll feel very depressed. We can all imagine 
what that's like, or we've gone through it.
There's a suggestion I would make that would 
solve that problem. The cities in this country,  
if we got together and pushed, could 
use something called “eminent domain”.  
That is a legal right every city has to 
seize property, to take property that is  
in the view of the city not in the general 
interest of the population, force the owner to  
sell it at a legally determined market price, 
and take it over. The cities could do that,  
saying that an empty store, a closed store, simply 
because workers want a union level of support,  
is a social interest, and the city has an interest 
in having stores that are well maintained,  
workers well-paid, and so forth. The city 
could then take the restaurant, once it closed,  
and say to the workers “Okay, now it’s yours, 
it's a worker co-op.” The city owns it,  
we will allow you to pay over time, so it 
becomes yours, call it a rent if you like,  
call it a payment plan, if you like. It really 
doesn't matter. The workers would keep their jobs,  
the community would keep its Chipotle type store, 
and the workers would become entrepreneurs,  
just like that, overnight. And you know what? 
It would make a lot of corporations think a lot  
longer and a lot harder before they close their 
stores if it meant that they might lose them.
My last update that we'll have time 
for, is really just a shout out.  
On June 1st of this year the United 
States Department of Education  
announced that $5.8 Billion worth of student 
loans would no longer have to be repaid. These  
are the loans outstanding at that time taken out 
by students at the for-profit Corinthian Colleges,  
three or four of them, as I recall. Corinthian 
Colleges were a kind of fraudulent operation that  
existed from1995 to 2015. For 20 years they made 
grandiose promises to students who took out big  
fat federal loans to get an education, a horrible 
exploitation of young people's hopes and dreams.  
When they folded, when the fraud was 
exposed, and the Corinthian Colleges stopped,  
of course people were stuck with debts but didn't 
have the education. And even when they got it  
earlier, it didn't count for very much because 
the promises were empty. A group of young people,  
associated with the Occupy Wall Street movement 
that many of you remember, calling themselves the  
Debt Collective, went to work on law and other 
ways of clawing back from the federal government,  
getting debt relief for abused, misled students, 
and after many years of struggle, this Occupy  
Wall Street movement succeeded. Almost 
$6 Billion of relief for student debtors.
We've come to the end of the first part 
of today's show, and before we move on,  
I want to remind everyone that Economic Update is 
produced by Democracy@work, a small donor-funded,  
non-profit media organization celebrating 
10 years of producing content focused  
on critical system analysis, and visions of a more 
democratic and equitable world. For instance, my  
book “Understanding Socialism”, tackles the taboos 
of socialism while unveiling the often-hidden  
histories of it, and offers a way forward by 
establishing real democracy in the workplace.  
It is available, as all of our products are at 
Democracy@work.info. I also want to thank our  
growing community of supporters that make 
this show and everything we do possible.
Please stay with us. We'll be right 
back with Professor Noam Chomsky.
[Wolff]  
Welcome back, friends, to the second half of 
today's Economic Update. Well, all I can say  
is that is an honor, a genuine honor for me, as 
well as a pleasure, to welcome to our microphones  
and to our cameras, Noam Chomsky. I'll say 
that silly old thing about how he doesn't need  
an introduction, because you all know 
him, but I'm going to give you a brief one  
anyway. He was born in 1928 in Philadelphia. He 
did his studies, both undergraduate and graduate,  
at the University of Pennsylvania, before joining 
the faculty at MIT, where he stayed for 60 years,  
and became a globally renowned linguist and 
philosopher. He left MIT eventually, and became  
laureate professor at the University of Arizona. 
He is internationally renowned, and many times  
honored as one of the world's great linguists, 
philosophers, and critical public intellectuals.
So, first of all, Professor Chomsky, 
thank you very much for joining us.
[Chomsky] My pleasure to be with you.
[Wolff] Okay, I want to jump right in. 
You and Vijay Prashad have recently  
produced a book called “The Withdrawal”, and it 
has to do with the US's military misadventures  
in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan. Do you think it 
is a reasonable understanding of what is happening  
in the world today, to speak of a decline of, an 
end, if you like, of the US empire in the world,  
the one that basically came into its modern form 
after World War 2? Something like the decline of  
the Roman or Greek or British empire. Is that a 
reasonable understanding from your perspective?
[Chomsky] Well, over a long stretch, the US 
domination of the world has of course declined. It  
hit its peak, as you said, at the end of World War 
2. At that point, the United States had a position  
of global power that had no remote analog in human 
history. US controlled the western hemisphere,  
controlled both oceans, controlled the opposite 
sides of both oceans. Other industrial powers  
had been devastated by the war. The United States 
gained enormously economically through the war.  
Manufacturing production practically quadrupled. 
It had maybe 40-50% of the world's wealth. Nothing  
like that in history. Couldn't obviously, couldn't 
last forever. In fact, within a couple of years  
it declined.1949, China became independent, 
what's called in the United States  
“the loss of China”. The terminology expresses the 
conception of how the world is supposed to be run.
After that, Industrial powers reconstituted 
themselves. The third world began to decolonize,  
got the non-aligned movement. By about, say 
1970, the world was what's called “tripolar”.  
Major center in North America, based on the 
United States, in Europe based on Germany mainly,  
and in Asia at that point based mainly on Japan. 
Since then, other changes have taken place.  
Collapse of the Soviet Union, maybe short 
period of euphoria in the United States: “We can  
take over the world again”. Of course, that 
couldn’t last. We're now in a period where  
the analogy to the Roman 
Empire is not completely wrong.  
As in the case of Rome, the United 
States is under severe attack  
from within. The society's collapsing from 
within. In many ways, internationally,  
it has overwhelming power, so in the military 
dimension no combination of states is even close.
In other words, so-called soft power like 
trade, commercial relations, and so on,  
it's being overcome by China.  
The United States is trying to hold it back but 
doesn't know how to do it. You can't overcome  
economic development infrastructure, 
building loans and so on, with bombs. So,  
China's constructing this enormous Eurasian 
system, the Belt and Road Initiative, includes  
India, Pakistan, and Russia. Its extending 
to Africa, where China is now the main,  
has the major trade relations, even to 
Latin America, the United States’ backdoor.  
All the United States can do in response to 
this is extend, use its comparative advantage  
in military force. So, the US is 
now constructing what's called  
a ring of what are called “sentinel 
states”, heavily armed, aimed at China.  
Advanced precision weapons. South Korea. Taiwan. 
Japan. New Zealand. Australia. India is kind of a  
reluctant partner, not really participating. 
The idea is to try to prevent what's called  
“Chinese Aggression”. What's Chinese Aggression? 
Well, it's not off the coast of California. There  
are confrontations off the border of China. But 
the main Chinese aggression is its development,  
which cannot be contained by military force.
Now, there's another conflict developing in 
Europe. Putin's invasion of Ukraine, in the short  
term, at least, gave the United States a wonderful 
shot in the arm, great gift. It pushed Europe into  
the US pocket. Now, there has been a background 
conflict since the end of the Second World War,  
about whether Europe would be essentially a 
satellite of the United States within the NATO  
framework, the Atlanticist framework, or whether 
Europe would move on an independent course, become  
what was called the “Third Force” in international 
affairs, a long line sketched by DeGaulle, Willy  
Brandt’s Ostpolitik, Gorbachev's proposals for a 
European common home from Lisbon to Vladivostok  
with new military alliances. That was another 
option. Well, for the short term, at least, that's  
been blocked by Putin's invasion, which handed 
Europe to the United States on a silver platter,  
best gift he could have given Washington's 
imperial pretenses. Whether this could last,  
is very much an open question, because 
it's not at all clear that Europe can  
really survive in any great viable way if it 
breaks from Russia and Eurasia. Notice that Russia  
is the barrier between Europe and the Eurasian 
land mass that China is developing so extensively,  
bringing in the East Asian economies.
 
The US is, if you look at it in what are  
called geopolitical terms, the US now 
is kind of an exaggerated case of what  
England was for centuries. England was an island 
off the coast of Europe, and its main strategies  
were to try to keep Europe from becoming unified. 
The United States is now kind of an island off the  
coast of Eurasia, and its goals are to keep it 
from becoming unified. That means incorporating.
[Wolff] So, let me ask you then what 
seems to me, the follow-up question.  
If it is correct, as you argue, that the United 
States, in some ways perhaps Europe also,  
is tearing itself apart from within, in the 
social divisions, class divisions and all  
the other fighting and splitting of the society 
apart. And then all it has to hold onto its empire  
is the military. It doesn't look really good for 
the United States to be falling apart inside and  
having to rely on military in the face of 
the Chinese and other economic powerhouse  
that outgrows the United States and has been 
doing that for 30 years. It does look like  
this is an effort to stop something 
that has very little chance of success.
[Chomsky] Well, it's very 
interesting to see how in the  
internally dysfunctional United States this 
problem is being faced. So, it's commonly  
observed that Congress is dysfunctional, can’t do 
anything. That's a curious way of saying that the  
Republican party has simply gone off the 
rails. They're not a parliamentary party  
in any traditional sense. Their policy is very 
explicit: announces it will just block everything,  
make sure that the country will be harmed 
as much as possible, so it will be blamed  
on the Democrats, and we can retake power. It's 
quite open, says it in almost those words. So,  
the GOP blocks everything in Congress, but they 
accepted one thing: a “China Competition Act”.  
The United States’ US infrastructure is 
falling apart, the bridges are collapsing, the  
electric grid, it doesn't work, the only end 
of it, there's a sharp cutback in development,  
there's a huge shortage of chips, because 
they're not producing chips here, so what  
can we do about it? Well, one possibility 
would be to pass legislation to carry,  
as during the Second World War, or the 
First War period, with massive government  
intervention to develop the economy. Can't 
do that, so therefore they passed the China  
Competition Act. We can rebuild our roads and 
bridges to compete with China. It's the only way  
it could get through. The only way the GOP would 
allow it to go through is a China Competition Act.  
Well, of course, it's symbolic of the 
internal destruction and disorder.
We, incidentally, today, just today, learned 
something new about it. There's a new report  
that came out which people should look at, 
from Axios, which is usually fairly reliable.  
It's a description of something 
that kind of slipped under the radar  
in the last days of the Trump years. Right 
before Trump left office, he had a directive  
establishing what was called “Schedule F” for 
civil servants, a plan to potentially remove  
the entire civil service system, - at least the 
leading elements of it, and to replace them by  
Trump loyalists. The civil service bureaucracy 
has traditionally been basically nonpartisan,  
just keeps functioning whoever's in office. 
But this was an effort to change it radically,  
to make sure that the leading elements are 
Trump's loyalists, and they will run what's  
left of the government as an organization beholden 
to the ultimate leader. There's a name for that.  
That's outright Fascism, not proto-fascism. 
Well, when Biden came in, he rescinded the  
offer, the order, but the Republicans are probably 
coming back, and there's now debate in Congress  
about what to do about it. The House passed a 
resolution, calling for legislation to block  
it. Senate's not going to accept it. GOP won't 
accept it, because they want it to come back in.
[Wolff] Professor Chomsky, I 
wish we had much more time.  
I would like to thank you very, very much. And, 
to my audience, what can I say? This is a very  
unusual opportunity to hear somebody explain 
what has been happening to us, and what we  
face as we go forward. And, as always, I look 
forward to speaking with you again, next week.
