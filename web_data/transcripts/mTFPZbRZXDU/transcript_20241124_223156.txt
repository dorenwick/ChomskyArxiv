no John Sookie thanks very much for
coming in and talking to us here at the
world we've seen the stock markets in a
frenzy the last couple of days what does
that tell you about the state of the
global economies it's very unclear first
of all it's worth mentioning that the
stock market is not the economy if you
look at the column by noted economist
Paul Krugman in the New York Times today
he says the three things you should know
about the stock market the stock market
is not the economy the stock market is
not the economy the stock market is not
the economy the stock market is mostly
rich Investor's
banks it's mostly owned by the very
wealthy and it's their estimate of
what's happening and they're very clear
about it now we've had a year of Donald
Trump as president you were very fearful
about what his presidency would mean how
do you reflect now a year in on how he's
going and where he's taking the country
I think the best and most authoritative
assessment was perhaps given by the
famous Doomsday Clock began seven
minutes before midnight in 1947 after
the atom bombing it's been oscillating
since just now a couple of week ago it
was moved forward to two minutes to
midnight after a year of Trump that's
the closest it's been two terminal
disaster since 1953 when the US and
later the USSR exploded thermonuclear
weapons demonstrating that human
intelligence had now developed the
capacity to destroy everything on earth
now it's moved again to two minutes to
midnight the two major issues which they
bring up of course or the growing threat
of nuclear war on the increasing threat
of
global warming both of them extended
amplified by the actions of the Trump
administration in the past year these
are the most serious issues that humans
face in fact have ever faced in the
history of the species and they're both
the world's major power most powerful
country in history is now leading the
way towards what may be terminal
obstruction how pessimistic then are you
now that for whatever reasons the human
race is is on a path to self-destruction
or is there an element of optimism is
there is there light there yes there are
many quite hopeful signs so again take
the United States most important country
in the world actions influence of the
state of the world more than any other
and go back to the 2016 election the
focus of attention of course is on the
Trump victory but if you think about it
the electoral victory of a billionaire
who had a huge financial backing spent
close to a billion dollars on the
campaign I had enormous media support
the fact that he won the election is a
little unusual because he wasn't the
establishment candidate but it's pretty
much within a normally expected range
however something else happened which
was really astonishing Bernie Sanders
who came from nowhere even used the
scare word socialist had no support from
private wealth or corporate power
I had no media support the meet either
ignored or denigrated him would have won
the Democratic Party nomination if it
hadn't been for the Massa nations of
party managers might well have won the
election
is now far and away the most respected
political figure in the country well one
of the the trading revolutions that
we're told here in Australia will be the
signing of the trans-pacific partnership
now this was the partnership that the
Americans and the Trump decided not to
be a part of we're told as these sorts
of partnerships are great for workers
you don't think so
well we have to be a little cautious
about that the the the TPP was quite
unpopular in the United States in fact
both candidates even Clinton reluctantly
were said they were opposed to it but
you have to be careful about why they
were opposed there were elements of the
TPP which were very seriously
objectionable there are others which are
fairly positive and unfortunately the
reasons why Trump pulled out was not
because of the objectionable features it
was because of the more positive
features and one consequence of this is
to reduce US influence in the Pacific
region in fact much of the world it's a
gift to China increases their influence
but that has little to do with the
reasons why the TPP was in many respects
a deeply objectionable program it was
basically it wasn't a free trade
agreement like NAFTA or any others
that's a mischaracterization these are
fundamentally investor rights agreements
Australia in the u.s. are tightly bound
by a defense treaty in the context of
North Korea and China what are the risks
for Australia the risks to Australia
well you know everyone has risks China
is a growing expanding power it's
expanding its influence it's carrying
out aggressive actions in the South
China Sea it's
we'll pursuits pursuing its interests in
many ways some denying some destructive
United States has in the dominant world
power remains the dominant world power
seeking to maintain its influence and
control that's certainly not averse to
using force no need to go through the
record and Australia has to make history
is not a it's not a major super world
power but it's a significant one and it
has to choose ways let us hope ways
which will tend towards alleviating
reducing conflicts opening ways for more
beneficial international policies to
take place meanwhile attending to quite
serious issues arising within Australia
that's a difficult balancing act but
Australia has the intellectual the
economic other resources to pursue a
positive path in world affairs Noam
Chomsky thank you very much for talking
to the world thank you very much
