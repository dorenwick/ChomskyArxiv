Nome chumsky if one were to judge by his
books is not one but two people there's
n Chomsky professor of linguistics
probably the most famous expert in the
world on the nature and structure of
language whose contributions to this
esoteric science have not only been
original they've been
revolutionary and then there's Nome
chumsky the pist and political
philosopher whose articles and books on
American political policy in general and
the war in Vietnam in particular have
aroused intellectuals and given support
to both the anti-war and draft
resistance
movements both gome chonis are resident
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where he's professor of
modern languages and

Dr chumsky what is the relationship
between uh thought and language you know
I vaguely have the idea that when I
think and when I dream I'm doing it in
words does this mean that if a person
didn't know a language he couldn't think
abstract thoughts well I don't want to
pretend to give any expert answer to
that but on the basis of uh my own
introspection I I'm sure I think in
language but I'm also sure I I think in
visual imagery and uh uh and in other uh
symbolic forms as well I would think
that uh clearly if you don't have a
language you can't express a very rich
range of thought and I assume that that
contributes to that do that suggest that
I think in words because because the
words are available if they weren't
available that would would be a thought
process that went on in other kinds of
symbols well I I think for example you'd
have no difficulty imagining a scene
let's say and imagining something taking
place in that scene even without a
verbal commentary how would I do with
such things as truth and beauty and all
the the wonderful VAR well there
certainly would be sharp limits on the
range of thought if language were not
available but I wouldn't go so far as to
identify
them what about the language in which a
person does think I suppose it's the
language which is most natural to him I
asked one guest in which language he
dreamed and because he spoke six or
seven languages and his answer was that
it depended upon the character he was
talking with he used a language which
was appropriate his language tied uh to
does can one think more facily in one
language or another for example well I
certainly there it's it's difficult in
uh as an adult let's say to acquire
another language anguage so readily and
with such facility that one can really
think in it fluently and easily there
are rare individuals who can do this but
children on the other hand probably can
Master quite a number of languages and
deal with them all essentially as native
languages thinking them dreaming them
the so on really almost be unconscious
of what language they're using at any
given moment I suppose internally I
didn't grow up this way myself but
friends who've uh grown up in
multilingual environments say that uh as
very young children they were even
unaware that they were speaking
different languages they knew that you
spoke one language in the street and
another language to your grandparents
and another language to someone else but
they didn't really identify them as
different languages just different ways
of speaking to different individuals so
a person who to a person who's not
multilingual and particularly one that
didn't grow up in a multilingual family
would almost seemed it would be more
difficult to think in another language
because of its structure than it would
to to think in this language for example
whose structure seems to be
easier to to work with well unless
you're lucky enough to be able to
acquire a language in a natural setting
whatever that means exactly uh it's
extremely difficult to really
internalize it to to make it really part
of yourself in the way in which your
native languages and I suspect there's
little doubt in fact that that's just
the property of human brain you know
that there's a way of
developing uh a system which is really
part of our thought and life
and there is another way of acquiring a
system that remains at a certain
distance from us we can handle it
intellectually but uh but there is a
barrier to to as you say internalizing
it easily There's a Great Barrier and in
fact it apparently gets much more
severe uh uh as in probably I'd say in
adolescence or later than that it's
almost extremely difficult if not
impossible to pick up a a new language
as really an integrated internalized
language does the um the uh nature or
the structure of language tell us
anything about how the human mind works
I think it tell us a good deal in fact
my own feeling is that's for myself at
least that's the major interest in the
study of language is that I think uh
this Lang use of language is plainly a
very distinctive human property and one
which is you it is distinctive that is
well the fact we can teach a a bird to
say words means nothing and well you can
teach I think the most interesting work
recently has been with the with uh
chimpanzees who've been taught
extensive symbolic systems as far as I
can see these are complicated
associational systems and I think uh
very different from language and the way
they function in my opinion though
there's much controversy about this and
I think by pursuing that kind of line of
Investigation in fact one may in fact
discover in more precise detail what are
those unique I'm sure they are unique
properties of language that make it
possible for a a human child so readily
to acquire the system of vast complexity
and to use it it is vastly complex it's
incredibly complex and it does
contribute immensely to the possibility
of uh creative thought and expression in
a way which is totally unique to human
beings and I think that by looking at
the detailed structure of language one
can we have an almost incomparable way
of gaining some insight into the
specific nature of the human mind as a
as a unique biological structure
existing nowhere else as far as we know
so what we discover will be transferable
probably to other areas of of learning
Beyond language well I think it's is
that going to be very interesting to try
to in fact there are a good deal of
modern cognitive psychology so-call does
try to use linguistic models and
investigating other domains of
intellectual competence and that's I
think a very fruitful and rewarding path
to follow it's very difficult in other
domains to gain such insight into the
complexity of structure as in the case
of language we simply it's language is
not only uniquely human but it's also
uniquely easy to study among the various
kinds of uh intellectual achievements
that a person develops for example it's
you know you also have a very
complicated theory of physical space and
uh that you've developed somehow every
human has or a theory of human
interaction or Theory of Personality and
so on but we don't externalize these as
we externalize their language is there
to be seen measured and everything and
therefore we have lots of possibilities
of studying it and through studying it
gaining I think considerable insight
into into the nature of mental
capacities and cognitive structures and
human intellectual achievements and in
general there are a good many people
specialist in the field as you know who
believe that language is simply a matter
of of training that that a child can be
trained to speak and that uh there's
nothing unique about this you I know
feel that there's something more than
simply training why do you feel that
there's something more to learning
language than simply training well first
of all it's it's worth mentioning that
most overwhelmingly people learn
language without training I mean if you
simply immerse a child in a situation
which language is spoken he acquires the
system he must but it's more than a
response to the stimul of the person
around him speaking well well the the
the most obvious and sort of gross fact
about language which shows that I think
is the uh Innovative creative character
of it and every child is capable of uh
understanding and producing very complex
structures which have no simple
relationship no point BYO relationship
no uh no no relationship on the Bas of
analogy let's say experience that he's
present generative creative structures
of language just that that you can as
we're talking we say new things which we
may not have said before we hear new
things as we talk there's very little
repetition in what we say Well if you
really were to to see how little
repetition there is you can let's say
take a a book or a newspaper or a
library for that matter and search for
repetitions of phrases or sentences and
so on they they occur but rarely so I
mean there are particular subp parts of
language say read Greetings or uh
conventional utterances of of one sort
or another that do repeat frequently but
these are incidentally often marginal in
their structure for example a sentence
like how do you do has a structure which
is in fact unique it's not the structure
of any English sentence uh that and we
don't create new sentences of that type
that's just a ritualized utterance but
most of our linguistic interchange is in
fact highly Innovative and of course
it's not just random I mean it's
Innovative but somehow appropriate to
situations doesn't necessarily follow
the rules that we were all taught in
school of a subject and a predicate or a
noun and a verb I mean I would have the
impression that somehow in my schooling
I was taught to do what it is that I do
now yeah well people have that
impression but the reason is that the
actual rules of language which certainly
are not taught in school because in fact
nobody even knows them to this day are
totally unconscious I mean what you're
taught in school is some relatively
superficial set of generalizations about
some of the
products is it important to know that
well I think it'd be important to know
it but the point that has to be stressed
is that one first of all that everyone
knows you know speaks a language very
fluently and very rich language before
he ever goes to school and furthermore
even if you wanted to teach somebody the
rules of language you wouldn't be able
to do it because the rules are largely
unknown we're just barely beginning to
discover them it it seems to us that
there's no problem in speaking just as
it seems to us that there's no problem
in what's say walking but if we were try
to try to design an automaton let's say
that would uh walk or ride a bicycle or
uh identify a person I mean for example
you look at me from one point of view
and if I turn my face you could still
recognize me that's not so easy to do I
mean we can do it because we have some
special unknown capacities for
perceptual identification well in the
case of language to we have this whole
totally unconscious set of intricate
mechanisms I mean something's built into
the to the system well I have no doubt
that uh most of the richness of the
structure of language is just the
biological property of the organism
can't be can't be taught any more than
you can be taught to have two arms
you've got no way that you can x-ray it
or or well put your finger on it at the
moment uh neurophysiology is not in a
state where one can detect the physical
structures that underly linguistic use I
mean only rather gross things are known
for example it's known that uh that uh
language is uh controlled by the do the
brain has two hemispheres and language
is controlled by one Domin hemisphere
incidentally humans are as far as I know
as far as anyone knows the only organism
that has lateralization that has
specialization of the two hemispheres
Apes don't for example and this is as is
well known this is closely connected
with language and uh you know areas of
the brain are known that have special
relevance to various language functions
but when you get into the detailed
intricate structure of the system it's
still a mystery entire mystery one might
say the same about learning nobody knows
anything about the Neurology of learning
either for that matter now one of the
most controversial things that you've
come up with is the fact that what
you're saying is true not only of
English but true of all languages a
commonality that runs through all
languages I would have guessed that some
languages were so rigidly structured
that if you learned a set of 20 rules it
would take care of all situations well
uh see if if what I just said before is
true that is if a great deal of the
structure of language is just a
biological property that you bring to
the learning situation not something
that you acquire in it and if we further
assume as is unquestionably the case
that humans are not specifically adapted
to learn one language or another that is
there's no racial difference that makes
it easier for you to learn this language
or that language or something of that
sort from those two assumptions alone it
follows that all languages are going to
be essentially uniform in that part of
their structure which is biologically
determined just as there's a there only
going to be certain possible limitations
in in the kind of gate that you can use
when you walk you can't fly you know and
no human beings going to fly we're all
going to walk we may walk in slightly
different ways and these may be
culturally determined in part and so on
well in a I don't want to press the
analogy too far there's more
differentiation in language than that
but still I think that there is simply a
biologically determined uh Rich
framework which we can learn a lot about
incidentally I think we can find out a
good deal about it and there are
interesting theories about it that
predispose us to acquire a system of
great complexity of a very specific sort
on the basis of a very slight
familiarity very slight exposure to data
you see one of the most remarkable
things about acquisition of language is
that U the the child or for that matter
an adult has had very few seconds in his
lifetime and very and the total range of
data available to him is rather small as
compared with the with his ability to
express himself and to uh produce and
understand uh uh sentences and
utterances and discourses as he does in
his normal life and that again indicates
that uh that there's a
biologically determined structure which
therefore must be uniform across
languages now as far to get back to your
original point the you know whether
there are languages with a small number
of rules that would suffice to explain
everything certainly nothing of that
sort is known I mean in so far as
languages have been carefully studied
living languages at least they seem
uhu
basically to they do differ and you know
one language is not another language but
they don't differ differ as far as We
Know there still creative aspect in all
languages is absolutely un that's just a
human property I mean which is true of
every language how did you become
interested in linguistics I know you
grew up in Philadelphia your father was
a Hebrew scholar and it's been written
about you that you proof read his book
on medieval Hebrew grammar at the age of
what 10 something like that did you have
a kind of
genetic fate that you were going to go
into to language as a result of that
well I was undoubtedly influenced by my
father's work in medieval Hebrew grammar
which I did uh was extremely interested
in and read his work and so on it then
lapsed for a while and I uh I actually
came back to it in college from a
totally different point of view uh did
you and your father talk a good deal
about this was it a matter of family
conversation that well the nature of
languages yeah that I mean it was one of
his he was his major scholarly interest
of his and uh I picked up a good deal
about it so often his son tends to go on
opposite direction rather than the same
direction well I don't know if one would
really call this the same direction I
mean his uh my own interest in
linguistics developed from a very rather
different point of view and although
there is
Convergence uh and I suppose influence
has to be still it's a it's a different
rather different uh uh area of
linguistics I mean the kind of
linguistics that I began to study in
college had uh developed in Virtual
in a in a totally separate intellectual
tradition from the one in which I had
that in which I had this kind of
informal background it was very useful
incidentally have had that informal
background in studying technical
scientific Linguistics later on and I
think the merger of the two was for me
at least very useful GA your interest in
college grew out of an association with
one of your professors who apparently
persuaded you not to leave College as a
matter of fact yeah I was sort of
planning to drop out of college
considering it an utter bore by by about
sophomore year I guess just not
challenging enough well yeah I found
nothing interesting in it really and
took one course after another and that
killed my interest in one field after
another and uh I guess by the time I was
a sophomore I'd sort of had it uh until
I met zelig Harris who turned out to be
an outstanding linguist I met him in
totally different contact had nothing to
do with Linguistics but I liked him was
impressed with him it was the first
really intellectually interesting person
I was the context in which you did meet
in politics yeah radical politics
radical politics which is your other
your other interest of course which was
a major interest of mine in fact the
overwhelming interest at that stage of
my life and I met him in that connection
uh actually it had to do with the
left-wing uh what was then called
Zionist I guess would now be called
anti-zionist activities that I was
deeply involved in and that he was
engaged in and we had many uh he very
significant influence on my thinking in
that area as well but through that
contact I became gradually interested in
work he was doing he finally got back
into it and ended up what was the source
of of of your rather revolutionary
Theory the one you've just been
discussing up to the point where you
enunciated this Theory U Linguistics was
a somewhat different study and when you
did enunciate it it caused a
considerable furer so it was a it was
certainly an original approach do you
know what set you off on that from the
more conventional studying of
linguistics that you had done at
College well it's you know one can never
be certain about that kind of thing it I
mean there
were I think in part it was due to the
fact that I approached language at once
from a point of view which was related
to what I had what what I was more or
less immersed in in formally before I
ever got to
college uh the kind of linguistics that
I had that I began to know about
informally had to do largely with
historical change and with efforts to
explain the facts as they now exist on
the basis of changes that had taken
place through a sequence of historical
stages uh the Linguistics that I was
studying in college was very anti- exlan
it was very descriptive it was in a
sense you might almost say quasi
behavioristic it was interested in this
is what happened but no explanation well
it was an effort to give accurate
descriptive uh accounts of languages and
it was often done in a very
sophisticated way uh to me that seemed
inadequate largely because I knew of the
uh
how explanation would appear in in a
historical context and I was encouraged
to try to develop an explanatory theory
in part also by the fact that I was
fortunate enough to be studying logic
and Mathematics and hence had some grasp
of the kinds of formal systems that in
fact were required to attempt to give a
an account of this ultimately of this
creative ability putting all these
things together that you came to Harvard
as a junior fellow and you did much of
your work at that time M now when you
did produce your first uh Publications
on this that they they weren't published
the three simply weren't accepted well
in fact the first the only really
extensive work that I did on it long
book is in fact it's in press now but it
was finished in
1955 and it couldn't be published at
that time and uh it was turned down in
fact by Publishers not unreasonably
actually it was unrecognizable nobody
could even tell what field it was in and
I was unknown and was but uh what I did
was
U uh well in fact it was several it was
quite a few years I think before this
work had much of an impact in the field
and that was largely I think because of
U some other linguists who became
interested in it and uh I began to work
in at man named Robert Le in particular
my colleague Mars Hy at MIT what you you
teach Linguistics at MIT what do you do
to keep your students from falling into
the same state of IND difference that
you did when you were in
school well
uh I don't know what to say about that I
mean first of all I have to do mostly
with graduate students who tend to be
very highly
motivated uh I do teach undergraduates
but I teach them in other domains I
teach an undergraduate course in social
and political Theory and there I think
many of the problems of how one relates
to uh intellectual work and an academic
commitment and Scholar
commitments and so on do arise and
that's a very personal matter I uh I
don't think there's any formula nor
would I ever try to persuade someone to
uh follow a particular path that's
something one has to work out for
himself and there are many difficult you
said that your that your original uh
association with zelig Harris was in the
area of radical politics you are
identified with the new Left whatever
that is you certainly have been an
activist as well as a writer in anti-war
anti Vietnam War uh and you've said that
the course of history may be determined
to a very significant degree by what the
people of the United States will have
learned from the catastrophe meaning of
course the Vietnam War what in your
opinion have we learned from this
experience I would say very little uh
unfortunately uh at the time I wrote
that which I guess was seven or eight
years ago what I had in mind was that
there are really two different ways of
looking at this catastrophe one can look
at it
as a failed Venture a mistake something
which was it was a mistake because it
failed mistake because it failed but
perfectly all right if it succeeded uh
and I think it's probably fair to say
that at least among intellectuals people
who are who write and speak publicly you
been better harsh on the intellectuals
yeah I think they're totally
unprincipled on this I mean I think the
dominant view is that uh if we had
gotten away with it it would have been
all right but we couldn't get away with
it so therefore it was stupid and
therefore we should get out you know
worse than a crime it was Wonder or
something of that sort now if that's all
that's learned from it I think it'll
have no effect on future history it will
have shown that there are limits to uh
American imperialism and your opposition
has been on moral grounds that it was
wrong from the the outset although you
said your opposition came 15 years too
late well active opposition came 15
years too late I think the time for
active opposition should have been about
1950 or a little later uh but I didn't
become really actively engaged in
opposing the war until about 1964
65 uh and at that point the United
States was very deeply involved in what
if we were honest we would call
aggression against South Vietnam that's
in fact what it was uh but I had of
course always been opposed to the war in
fact I was opposed to the Korean War and
may surprise you but I was even
skeptical about the second world
war are you a pacifist no not a pacifist
are there justifications for War under
certain circumstances yeah I can see
justifications for a a defensive War I
could in putting it all together I think
there are justifications for a war
against Nazi Germany in the 40s but I
felt I was a high school student at the
time but uh felt then and have continued
to feel it in fact wrote about it in
this book that uh a good deal of the
alleged justification for the war was
totally beside the point and that we
were engaged in the war for reasons
other than uh opposition to Fascism or
uh concern for uh uh you know people
being sent together Chambers and things
of that kind in fact those motivations I
think were virtually
non-existent nevertheless despite the
hypocrisy and there was plenty I think
that that war could have could be
justified and I'm not a pacifist in the
sense of someone who believes that it is
in principle wrong ever and always to uh
undertake violent acts I think you have
to have a strong reason for it very
strong the burden of proof is certainly
on a person who wants to undertake the
use of means of violence but I believe
occasionally that burden can be meant
the way in which you describe the
Vietnam War particularly in your own
words uh is such that one would think
that any good American I use it in
quotation Mars would totally reject the
support of the Vietnam War it's it's in
your words it's it stands for all that
we're opposed to oppression of other
peoples and so forth now either you
would be wrong in your description well
there has to be a reason why the
American would accept a war of this
which is it I guess you would never say
it was a wrong description of course
it's a stupid question for that point
first of all I'm not sure see we don't
know what the population as a whole
accepts or rejects because they're
inarticulate largely uh among the people
who are articulate intellectuals people
who speak and write articles and so on I
think they've made it overwhelmingly
clear that uh that they consider the
question of right or wrong Irrelevant in
the case of the United States of course
it's relevant if we're talking about
some other country for example everyone
would agree that it was wrong for the
Russians to invade cze Slovakia that is
no one says well it was okay because
they got away with it but those criteria
are never applied to ourselves and that
is totally unprincipled though typical
of you know other societies act this way
as well and it's that kind of lack of
principle that I think has to be
overcome and the ideology behind being
to see ourselves as others see us or as
we see others I suppose see ourselves by
the principles that we occasionally
enunciate apply those to ourselves I
want to ask you in 30 seconds whether if
we do in fact by pursuing or expanding
upon your studies learn more about man's
intelligence and how it functions will
that contribute to a better life it may
contribute to a better understanding of
what the essential needs of human beings
are and from that it's conceivable that
someday we'll grow a concept of a of how
a decent Society ought to be organized I
think thank you very
much
