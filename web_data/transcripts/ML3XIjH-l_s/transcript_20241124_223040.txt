[Music]
hey everybody welcome to the what is
money show
uh i am thrilled and honored today to be
sitting down with a very special guest
mr gnome chomsky who is an emeritus
professor at mit
and a professor at the university of
arizona
noam it's a great pleasure to have you
here
and in honor of the namesake of the show
i'd like to start with a very general
question and topic
um
what in your view is the
proper
definition of money
and how do you see the proper role of
government
in money
well money is
an accepted main
means of exchange
it's nothing in itself it's based on
trust and
willingness to agree to
let this particular means of exchange be
used in some community there was a time
when it was
theoretically backed by
some fixed
uh
commodity usually gold
but that again is based on trust why
should anybody care about that
particular mineral
so it's a convention that says
let's accept this as the means of
exchange by now most money is just
something going on in the uh
inter on the you know the
electronic
media it's not a
medium at all
the role of government depends on what
kind of society we have
if there's no general answer
uh
i mean
there's a debate
has been a debate
if you look at the
concrete cases so let's take
the last 45 years
roughly
the
as you recall i'm sure when
ronald reagan's
inaugural address
uh it answered this question
it said government is the problem
not the solution
we have to
reduce government to the minimum
his own administration
acted in the opposite way
the
chair of government and
gdp actually grew
but the distribution of the way
government worked changed
the
scale
basically didn't change but the
functions did
and that was
perfectly predictable from his
from the framework that he was
developing that he was
expounding the
so-called neoliberal framework
in which it's not
government that grows or
shrinks but
the role of government shrinks
what are government decisions
are government decisions to
uh be
developed uh
social democratic welfare states say on
the style of the new deal
or is the role of government to support
uh private power and extreme wealth
essentially what it amounted to
what's called neoliberalism
has a definition but
if you look at it in practice it's just
class war
and that was pretty obvious from the
start
the uh
the economic guru of
the reagan administration
milton friedman
was very clear and plain about it
when you follow
reagan's precepts government is the
problem
that doesn't make the decisions go away
just puts them in other hands
so instead of being in the hands of
government which is
to some
limited extent
accountable to the population and
responsive to popular
pressures and
demands
you shift from there to
private
unaccountable
power as
no and milton friedman explained exactly
what its role is
in a famous article he pointed out that
uh speaking of corporations which is the
central component of the private system
he
said that the role of a corporation
is the sole
single role of a corporation
is to maximize
profit
for shareholders and
of course that means indirectly to
managers and ceos stock options and so
on
that's the sole responsibility of
corporations
it's rather curious of you when you
think about it because
the right to incorporate is a gift from
the public
the government
provides
you want to in court the group people
want to incorporate
the government that is the population
provides you with benefits
like limited liability
others
you don't want those benefits you don't
have to incorporate you can be a
partnership
but if you take the gift
milk friedman says there's no
responsibilities come along with it just
take the gift and run away with it
and from then on your only
responsibility is essentially green
well
that shifts the role of government
doesn't end it it shifts it to
sponsoring greed
that's essentially what it does
so if you look at the years that
followed that's exactly what happened
we moved from that point on into
what some economists have called a
bailout economy
the economy shifted substantially
to uh
from
manufacturing
production to finance
a
huge part of the economy now is
finance which not really
doesn't contribute to the economy it's
just uh
you know things electronic things
shifting around from one hand to another
the uh
and it
during the previous period so-called
regimented capitalism
of the uh
50s and 60s
there were no if there was finance of
course but on a much smaller scale
a bank was a place where
if you have some extra money you put it
there they
lend it to somebody to start a business
or send their kid to college or whatever
it may be
uh there were essentially no financial
crushes
the
financial system was
fundamentally serving the economy
and that changed radically after reagan
well he started right away having
financial crises
and bailouts
and that's why it's called a bailout
economy not just
for financial corporations also for
manufacturing corporations so in
2009 uh
president obama virtually nationalized
the auto industry
and
reconstituted it through government
subsidy
so you have a system of
a
bailout government subsidy
and so on to sustain the
economy that was developed as a
population loses badly we even have some
measures of that
so
the rand corporation
highly regarded the
reliable
research outfit
did a
couple of months ago did a study
of the
amount of
money that was
the wealth that was transferred
their words
from the lower
90 percent of the
income scale
the middle class working class the poor
transferred from them to
the very top
of the wealth scale actually mostly to a
one percent or even fraction of one
percent of the population
uh their estimate is close to 50
trillion dollars
over 40 years that's a
not trivial sum
and the top 1 of the population
uh
their income share
changed from 10
to 20
which is a
spectacular amount for one percent of
the population
oh the tax system was revised
so as to benefit the extreme wealth
i think last year my under trump was the
first time
in over a century
that billionaires
have paid a lower tax rate than say
steel workers
uh that's uh
it's all it's all government policy i
mean these things don't happen by laws
of nature
uh
also reagan also
essentially opened the spigots to all
sorts of
shenanigans that were illegal before
like uh tax havens shell companies
many devices were
developed to allow corporations
businesses to uh
avoid any responsibility the public can
simply enrich themselves
the pandora papers that are coming out
now give you
some indication of that
or takes a
the world's largest corporation apple
i think it was today they came out with
their
profits for last year and some
astronomical psalm i've forgotten the
number
uh
they don't have to bother paying taxes
they
set themselves up in ireland and
where there's low tax rates and figure
out ways not to pay the taxes there
they actually by now don't even make
their money in manufacturing
they've shifted
under tom cook they've shifted the
policy
from
production they still produce but they
shifted the emphasis from
production to uh
finance and rent
rent means you
make money off the
patents that you have
you manufacture from china they pay a
firm
the what are called the intellectual
property rights
it was instituted under clinton the
world trade organization rules which are
radically anti-free market they're
called free markets called free trades
radically anti-free trade
uh
very uh
extensive uh in a patent
regime which never existed in the past
not only product patents but process
patents
for long periods and
this is
a
fantastic interference with
free trade but very good for the
corporate sector
increasingly monopolized
so
you
have a system where
that's a take apple again
turns out that you make a lot more money
by financial speculation than by
improving your computers
so in fact the computers
may they may add some bells and whistles
but essentially they don't
improve the computers to be more
workable
but they do make a lot of money in rent
and in financial speculation
it's a new kind of a different kind of
economy
and
these are all policy decisions
they don't they were explicit they were
pretty clear at the beginning of the
reagan administration they've been
pretty much followed by his uh
successors
so take say oh i mentioned clinton but
take obama
obama came in at the
time of a major financial crisis one of
the
series of crises that have taken place
since the neoliberal regime was
installed
uh reagan actually left on a huge crisis
the housing
crisis the
savings and loan crisis living in launch
crisis
then the clinton left on a high-tech
crisis not a sphere
and then there are others and finally
came the
huge housing crisis of 2008 collapse of
the housing boom and
then the financial crisis and that was
serious
almost like the great depression other
government had to step in with huge
infusion of uh
tax money to rescue the collapsed
capitalist economy so take obama
but when he came in
the bush administration had just passed
the tarp legislation
which was a bailout legislation
had two parts
one part
was to bail out the perpetrators of the
crisis
and the banks
investment firms insurance companies
that had like aig
all involved in predatory loans and
various uh
complex
devices derivatives of various kinds to
scatter and spread the
responsibilities so they could make
money but not take responsibility they
made a mint
and then of course it all crashed so now
you have to bail them out
that was one part of the funding there
was another part
to
do something for the victims
people whose homes had been foreclosed
and lost to jobs and so on
well actually only half of the
legislation was ever implemented
it was so
grotesque that the
inspector general of the
treasury department neil borowski
actually wrote a
book about it
condemning what happened several offids
but that's the way the system works it's
a system geared to class war
and it's been effective
50 trillion dollars and 40 years is
not small pennies
no not at all um
and the time frame really out here
lines up nicely with
us abolishing the gold standard
internationally after the the infamous
nixon shock in 1971 so
perhaps i could ask you about you know
to what degree has going off the gold
standard effectively unrestrained
government deficit spending
um which which itself i mean enables
governments to effectively not be
accountable to citizens or to be less
accountable and that they can just
print money at infinitum to fund these
policy decisions and and it funds the
bailout economy you're describing as
well so what is the role of
gold or going off the gold standard over
the past 50 years
because it
couldn't be maintained it's
it strangles
the options for government to do the
things it has to do
but the question is once you free up the
options what does government do with
them
and if you look over the
years since nixon
it's pretty simple it's pretty
systematic
when the republicans come in
they create a huge deficit
democrats follow them they have to
somehow
deal with it
uh dick cheney when trump was blowing
huge holes through the deficit
uh cheney explained that reagan taught
us that deficits don't matter
in fact reagan
created a huge
uh
deficit but it didn't matter he was
funding the wealthy and the
powerful and the military system so
that's okay
uh clinton actually reduced it
uh
bush came in blew it up again with his
huge tax cut for the rich and war
expenses
obama kind of somewhat reduced it this
is the regular policy
uh the republicans are
uh don't care you know they just want to
their fundamental
program
not all not always in the past this is
not true of eisenhower but the modern
republicans
are basically
they have one commitment serve the very
wealthy and the corporate sect
and that's if that creates a huge
deficit it's no problem
reagan taught us the deficits don't
matter
so say take the trump years uh
his uh
big tax scam
a
huge gift to the
very wealthy and the corporate sector
stabbing everyone else in the back of
course that punched a hole in the
deficit
there were pretenses that it was going
to
trickle down and increase investment and
so on but
the usual pretenses none of that
happened
it
and notice that the republican party
today is very explicit about it
now they have
the current republican party mcconnell's
party
has established what they call red lines
for any legislation that they might
consider
one of the red lines is you cannot touch
the trump track tax cut
that's one
another interesting one is
you can't
fund the internal revenue service
has to be defunded
that's a good reason for that
what does the irs do
it goes after
tax cheating
the guy who hands in his
1040 doesn't cheat on taxes
there's massive tax cheating but among
the very wealthy
so therefore we can't touch that
you got to cut that out
and it's very similar to
the laws that the business community is
managing to push through the through one
of its major lobbies the allied the
uh
american legislative exchange council
the major business lobbies works at the
state level to write legislation and if
you take a look at the legislation it's
very instructive
so for example one
there's a good deal of wage theft in the
united states my businesses just don't
pay the wages or don't pay overtime and
so on
so one of alex's
major legislative
programs which
they've managed to pass through lots of
states
is that you can't
punish
wage theft and you can't even
investigate it
that's like defunding the irs
defending the irs of course is far
greater in the scale of the robbery that
it permits
but
it's very open and blatant there's
nothing hidden about it
of course the rhetoric is where the
working-class party you know we care
about people and so on but you never pay
attention to rhetoric you look at policy
so getting gold standard is a necessary
thing to allow the society to function
properly but then the question is what
do you do with it
do you establish uh
takes a social justice issues
it's worth mentioning that though the
united states is
by reasonable measures the richest
country in the world has extraordinary
advantages that no one else has
on social justice measures it's a
serious laggard
way behind other countries
pick something as essential as
health care
i mean
just about every country has some form
of
universal health care
the us
pays about
almost twice as much per capita as other
oecd countries in health care and has
some of the worst outcomes
if you've ever had to deal with the
health care system you know why
you go into the emergency room
first of all you spend half an hour
trying to figure out if you're what your
insurance is and are they going to cover
it then it turns out there's some small
print you didn't notice which means they
won't cover it
in fact a lot of the bankruptcies in the
united states are just people who can't
pay for health care
actually the united states has a
universal health care system
it's called emergency rooms
if you can
get yourself to an emergency room
somehow they'll take care of you often
very good care
it's the most expensive
cruelest form of universal health care
imaginable
and that's true on other measures too
i mean take something as simple as uh
maternal leave
you know support for a mother after a
baby's born
it's virtually universal
the u.s doesn't have any and it's joined
by
a few uh pacific islands literally
and this goes
across the board in fact there's
regular studies of it there's a
international
social justice measure that's done
i think it's under un auspices
which uh
just they just came out with a report
and we'll go for the last
10 years last decade
163 countries
all of them had some degree of
improvement in
social welfare measures except for three
three that declined
uh hungary
brazil
united states
which declined most it's mostly the
trump years
it's uh
and
that's
class war
so you
it's not the pro the issue isn't the
gold standard it's what you do
with the opportunities to fund things
can i ask
may i ask you what options specifically
were unavailable to government on a gold
standard that were subsequently made
available by going off of it that are
socially necessary
well it's a new deal for example
the government had to basically
drop those restrictions to get the
country out of the depression and it did
actually wasn't so much the new deal
that got the country out of the
depression of course it had it did it
was greatly beneficial that's my
childhood i remember it very well
my family were mostly unemployed working
people it was very beneficial to them it
didn't actually end the depression
depression was ended by huge government
expenditures
breaking all the rules
in the second world war which was very
beneficial to the economy nobody worried
about the gold standard
you spent what you needed
manufacturing
uh correctly quadrupled
uh
huge technological developments laid the
basis for post-workout
prosperity
uh
and in fact if you use government
funding
almost with i mean of course ultimately
some limits but if you are printing your
own currency
you can basically do it without
severe limits unless you run into
extreme inflationary pressures but uh
that's all very can be very beneficial
to the society isn't that just a way of
increasing the tax rate though on the
population in a more surreptitious way
well the taxes
tax rates are
if you look at them basically flat
the united states if you look at all the
taxes
not just income tax but payroll tax
sales tax and so on
it ends up being essentially flat across
the income distribution
uh now under trump
it's shifted now it's less
at the top end
as i said that's back to
a century ago
uh under
during the
neoliberal period last 40 50 years 45
years
of the
taxes have been shifted
they've been reduced for the for the
corporate sharply reduced for
corporate sector and
for
the rich which means somebody else pays
the poor or else you just pay in lower
services
worse services
because if you if you don't have
government funding for available for
health care maternal leave vacations so
on and so forth and of course people
will suffer
and in fact that's what's happened
services
uh benefits for the population have
significantly declined
over the neoliberal years
as indeed have wages
uh
take say the minimum wage which sets a
kind of floor under wages
it's actually declined by
about a third in real value
during the neoliberal period that's
quite a blow to people
uh real
non-supervisory male workers are
actually have lower real wages than they
had 40 years ago
but meanwhile
management salaries have just gone into
the stratosphere
that's way beyond
anything in history the other countries
well that's policy that's what you can
do with
government policy
so that this seems to be all
related to inflation to at least some
extent though um
inflation
inflate yeah but inflation itself is a
form of taxation
and and isn't that also driving
managerial compensation packages and
that do these you know they're basically
able to borrow money cheap perform stock
buybacks
uh a lot of their compensations based on
stock options so but that's not because
of inflation that's in order to make
money
by paying yourself instead of producing
but uh the united states hasn't had an
inflation problem since the 70s
i mean right now there's what's called
an inflation problem but that's for very
special reasons
inflation has been very low in fact low
below fed levels
in recent years well by fed definitions
though by cpi which is a it's a not an
accurate metric let's say
doesn't matter whatever measure you use
inflation's been
actually below
two percent sometimes it's almost been
negative
you can tell it from the way people uh
buy and sell
but inflation hasn't been a problem
maybe it's
sorry maybe it's better to ask it this
way so there's
since 1971 there's been a divergence
between productivity and wages as you
described real wages declining despite
productivity increasing
so has that not contributed to the
uh widening divergence of the rich and
poor
sure as productivity
i mean up until
the late 70s about during the
basically the new deal period
post new deal period that wages tracked
productivity
as you'd expect
that broke in
the late 70s
since then productivity increases wages
stagnated
the extra wealth produced goes into very
few pockets
so sure that increases inequality in
fact there's pretty good evidence that
the union density
has a is a major factor in inequality
there's a
recent study by
lawrence summers and one of his
associates i've forgotten who
who showed that
should pretty convincingly that
as
union
membership declines inequality goes up
and conversely
and it's apparently a large share
and their
estimate is
a major share in the increasing
inequality and notice that that's part
of the neoliberal program too it's very
anti-labor
reagan started it off right away
same with thatcher in england at the
same time
their first acts were to attack labor
to attack labor unions
which
using what in the world are considered
illegal means like
scabs
permanent replacement workers
uh
that's a big blow at unions it then
opened the door to the corporate sector
which started to do the same
meanwhile
the
nlrb was
basically neutralized the laws weren't
applied so
employers could use all sorts of illegal
means to uh
break strikes prevent organizing
clinton contributed to this too
so take nafta
uh nafta open among other
it shifted the employment
abroad
part of the intent so increases profit
reduces jobs
but
it also undermined labor organizing
there's actually a study that was taken
under nafta rules
by uh
kate bronfman brenner she's a
labor historian at the cornell
which found that
a large percentage i think it might have
been as much as 50
of organizing efforts were simply broken
by
illegal
uh moves by
corporations to threaten
to move the business
to mexico
if
you try to organize
that
that's substantial
they didn't intend to move through on
the threat but it's enough to block
organizing meanwhile all sorts of
so-called
scientific methods of strike breaking
have been developed they're now
businesses that specialize in how to
break strikes but most of it's illegal
but if you don't if you have a criminal
state it doesn't matter if it's illegal
right
let me ask so
i
we'll segue into that topic next one
more question about this so
in your view
is there a connection then between
the 1971
decoupling of the gold standard and the
decoupling of productivity and wages
no
no connection at all
no no real connection
the question was
how it was going to be used i mean the
country wasn't a had an economic problem
in the late 60s it was called
stagflation
but
that was one reason for
the break of the gold snare but the main
reason
was just
the country was running out of gold
because we were printing too much
currency
yeah but that's uh
you know that
had no effect on things like wages the
stagflation
was for several reasons
one there were
huge expenditures to
fund the
war in vietnam and the china wars
and
there was so much
resistance in the country
that
johnson couldn't
do couldn't say
a institute a national mobilization
during the second world war there were
extraordinary expenses but they were
actually good for the economy
because there was imposition
of a
rigid system
which
price controls and so on rationing
which the population accepted
because they were committed to the war
effort as i say i can remember that
vividly you just accepted it
you can't drive
you know you have to
have a victory garden you don't have all
the food you want okay we're doing it
because we want to win the war
huge expenses
but
it by the population johnson couldn't do
that
population was not in a mood to
sacrifice in order to fight a war that
they didn't like
so you ended up with stagflation
well some kind of move had to be made it
was finally made by
folker
under carter 1978
in a very
brutal way sent the country into a deep
depression recession
not quite depression and it also very
much harmed other countries
the third world countries that had
been induced
by the world bank
to take huge loans
like mexico
their economies crashed when u.s
interest rates went up
their interest rates were keyed to u.s
interest rates so when u.s interest
rates went up they couldn't pay the
debts
and they went into steep decline
it's got a big effect all over the world
including in the united states
but
i think this is not the reason for the
decline in wages that's policy
okay so
you know you've mentioned that
limited liability for a corporate entity
is a problem
right
beautiful that's a gift
but there's a cost right who's bearing
the cost of that limited liability
well there's a cost but again it depends
how it's used
so it takes a
19th century corporations
which had limited liability
what was a corporation in 1850s
well it was like
people in a town getting together
deciding to incorporate for a particular
purpose let's say build a bridge across
the river
so you incorporate you get limited
liability and enables you to accumulate
capital people don't
means that an individual doesn't himself
lost lose if there's a problem
so you can accumulate capital you can
carry out the job and then you end the
corporation
that's what a corporation was not always
but that's a large part of it
now the modern corporations are quite
different
they're the
uh here it's not a question of
whether the corporation you know
my own feeling is that there shouldn't
be such a right but that's a different
issue
of limited liability
you said there should not be a right of
limited liability
well i
take the same position as
basically the republican party under
abraham lincoln
namely that
serving a master
as a subordinating yourself to a master
is an intolerable attack on human rights
and human dignity
that was also the position of working
people in the 19th century goes back
millennia
back to greece and rome
but the
industrial system when it was
established
imposed subordination
of
it
of uh
skilled workers artisans others to a
master
that was and was bitterly fought
and as i say it was so strenuously
opposed it was even a slogan of the
republican party
but it finally established itself
so what we call taking a job
which was considered outrageous in the
19th century
basically means
agreeing to spend
most of your working out your waking
hours
under the control of a tyrant
that's what it means when you have a job
somebody else has the authority
they can tell you
you're allowed to take a bathroom break
at 3 pm you can talk to one of your
friends for five minutes and
if you're a truck driver you can't take
a stop to get some coffee
that's subordination to a target to
tyranny
what was bitterly attacked in the
19th century finally became acceptable i
don't think it should be
and isn't the the
antidote to that tyranny though is the
individual workers option to leave right
they don't they don't have to subject
themselves to the tyranny
yeah it's stored
you can starve or you can subject
yourself to tyranny actually one of the
first
to tell you an anecdote when i was a
college student harvard grad student
there was a invited lecturer by
ludwig von mises the
revere guru of the libertarian movement
and the thesis of the lecture was
that it's that unemployment is the fault
of the government
if you didn't have
government intruding you wouldn't have
any unemployment
and he gave a good argument
he said
let's suppose that
some guy you know joe
uh
is doesn't have a job
starving doesn't have a place to live
and he's offered a
rotten dangerous job at
a dollar an hour
well
rather than starve to death he'd take it
but then the evil government moves in
and establishes conditions for
employment
uh worker safety
a minimum wage and all kind of
intervention in the market and therefore
poor joe can't work and he's unemployed
so it's the fault of the government and
that basically is the libertarian
physician
it's the reason for example why
fun mises
was a strong supporter of fascism
if you read his
classic book
on liberalism back in nineteen
he was in austria then
that's a
a lot of it's just an ode to mussolini
said mussolini's fascism had saved
european civilization
it
was done with the best of intentions
that
what mussolini's facialism had done
was destroy the labor unions destroy
social democracy
destroy independent thought
people like grumpy were sent to prison
to
keep that mind from functioning
as they said
all of that was great
they will go down in history as saving
civilization
now if you look at
the
mises
organization
they have an explanation of why this was
okay they say well fun mises thought
that the block shirts would go away once
they'd done their job
yeah fine extenuation didn't go away
uh fun mesas himself could
barely contain his euphoria when the
proto-fascist austrian government in
1928
crushed the vibrant labor movement by
force
and there's a principle behind this the
principle is that labor unions do
interfere with the market
if you have a pure market it'll be like
this guy joe that i mentioned who has a
choice between
starving or taking a rotten job
then the market is functioning properly
but labor unions come in and try to give
special privileges to workers
meaning
uh if it's a very dangerous job
you have to have some protection
you have to have health uh occupational
standards
and you have to have
a wage sufficient so you can at least
you know maybe
feed your children a little bit
and that interferes with
what's called sound economics
sound economics means just let market
principles function
which
no it when you get to the neoliberal
period
they did
sort of accept
the neoliberal the libertarian doctrines
friedman and others but with plenty of
qualifications
so the government is sitting back there
to make sure you don't get into trouble
if you run into trouble the
friendly taxpayer comes in and bails you
out that's not called an interference
with sound economics
only if labor unions try to raise wages
that's an interference
that's interesting i've studied mises a
lot but i hadn't heard about that so
i'll look into it let me ask you
this question about
so presumably this gift of limited
liability
the cost of that gift
presumably is borne by anyone that's
affected right if if the corporation
builds the bridge and the bridge
collapses the victims of the bridge
collapse are not being compensated by
virtue of limited liability so they're
bearing the cost of the gift
my question is isn't printing
the story suppose the bridge remains
then everybody benefits from the bridge
right
so
yes you're taking a risk but there's a
benefit associated with it understood
my question would be
isn't printing currency or a monopoly on
currency production let's say
effectively a form of limited liability
for government because they can now
spend
and incur debts
at at their leisure and indiscretion and
then externalize the cost of that
spending and debt accumulation
via inflation
i understand
that's an interesting way to look at it
your the presupposition of your question
is that the government is some alien
entity
like somebody from mars
which is coming in and doing things to
us
there's another view of government
that government is of by and for the
people
it's just an
institution of the people
okay that's
another view of government
in that case if you look at government
that way as an ideal that we should
approach
then it's the people who are deciding
yes i want to have expenditures so
they'll be
safe jobs maternity leave
health care
uh
decent conditions for
at schools education and so on
that's the commun and a bridge and
infrastructure bridges don't collapse
that's the community that's deciding
through the instrument
that the unit that the community
controls
called the government well that's my
deal we don't quite have that but that's
that's a way of looking at government
which is the opposite of holding that
the government is some alien entity that
is doing things that might harm us
perhaps we could narrow the scope of the
question to the central bank then rather
than just the government in general
because the central bank is producing
currency without they're unelected right
there's no legislation
that is uh
enabling them to expand this taxation
via inflation so
is it is the central bank effectively a
limited liability corporation um
in the market for money
well the central bank is kind of a
mixture of a
quasi-political institution
the fed
chairs
chosen by
the executive
uh the members of the board are chosen
by the
government then the fed has the central
bank has
a pretty free authority
and that doesn't is not used to create
inflation
it's used to cut back wages
that's the function of the central bank
if inflation goes beyond
two percent
you raise rates
which cuts employment
that's the main function of the central
bank let's cut employment
harm workers
so that
the economy continues to function now if
you look at the fed our central bank
it actually has two
prime commitments
one of them is to
keep inflation from going too high
the other is to foster full employment
pay much attention to the second one
but those are
social political and economic
uh
conditions that come from the nature of
the society not from the nature of a
central bank
central you could have a central bank
which
serves both purposes
i should say if you go back a little bit
the onset of the neoliberal
assault on the population goes back a
couple years before reagan started in
the late carter years
uh
1978
the democrats
made their last gesture
towards doing something for the working
class
uh the humphrey hawkins uh
full employment bill
which was passed by congress
uh president carter didn't it was
anti-labor he didn't veto it but he
watered it down
so it had so no teeth became basically
voluntary
and that was essentially the
onset of the neoliberal period and
working people understood it
there was
doug fraser who was the
head of the uaw united auto workers
in 1978
left
resigned from a labor management
committee that carter had established
resignation was partly because of
the watering down of the bill and he
made a very powerful eloquent statement
he said
business is now fighting a one-sided
class war
against working people
the poor most of the middle class
they've abandoned the compact
tacit compact of the post-war years
that there would be
cooperation in
maintaining
basic decent living standards business
has broken with that
now it's a one-sided class war
and that's what neoliberalism is
i gave you some measures of it
but there's more of course
but these are
largely political decisions even markets
markets don't run on their own
markets are set up by governments
and they determine how they're going to
function
there's no such thing as just a market
functioning by itself
in fact if you look over history
the business classes
have regularly intervened to prevent
markets from functioning
because they would simply destroy
everything
if you allowed a market to function
without constraints everything would
get total chaos and crash
so the business world has repeatedly
intervened
to try to pressure government which it
greatly influences
to impose market regulation simply to
keep it from imploding
things like regulatory commissions for
example
hey everybody
as you've no doubt learned by watching
this show bitcoin is the single most
important asset you can own in the 21st
century
and one of the most important companies
in bitcoin today is
knightig knightig's mission is to get
bitcoin into the hands of as many people
as possible
one of the ways they are accomplishing
this mission is by empowering banks and
financial technology companies to offer
their own bitcoin products and services
as a true game changer in the industry
nida is safely unlocking the power of
bitcoin for forward-thinking individuals
and institutions alike
led by robbie gutman yenzao and ross
stevens nydig has absolutely exploded
onto the bitcoin scene recently and has
quickly become a leader in this space
so
whether you are a professional investor
looking for asset management services
or a company looking to white label your
own bitcoin product or service
consider nidig your single source
solution for everything bitcoin
so
let me ask you then what is the proper
role
of coercion in civilized society
i mean my understanding of government is
really to just at least in western
civilization to preserve life liberty
and property
is there anything beyond the scope of
that
life liberty and pursuit of happiness
is the phrase that was used by thomas
jefferson
produ protect property was james madison
james madison who
was the main framer of the constitution
held that the
pro a prime responsibility of government
is to protect the minority of the
opulent against the majority i'm quoting
that's how the country was set up
if you look at the constitutional system
the madisonian system
though the main
power was in the senate
in those days the executive was kind of
an administrator
and the house was of course scattered
the senate was the major
power center
and madison was very clear about this
and said yes the senate must be the
dominant institution
and it has to be protected from the
public
so it was unelected
until 1912
the senate was unelected
it's basically picked by elites
furthermore senators get long terms six
years
so they're not
subject to public pressure
and they're not distributed by
population so two per state you know uh
and the senate as madison put it
should be the wealth of the nation is
freeze
people who understand the right and
sympathize with the rights of property
owners that's
the constitution you take a look at the
this is well understood
you look at the scholarly literature
it's very good scholarly literature on
this
the
gold standard and scholarship now
rightly is a
very important work by
harvard law professor michael corman
the uh it's the main book on the
constitution forming the constitution
very interesting book
he uh
that the title of the book
is the framers coup
c-o-u-p the framers coup
their coup against democracy
the
radical farmers
uh
the people who had
served in the revolutionary army
they wanted democracy
the elites didn't wanna
i remember who the framers were
who was able to
sit in philadelphia for a couple of
months over the summer or even get there
this is the 18th century after all
the
founders were a group of
wealthy
white men
mostly slave owners
very impressive group in many ways if
you read the debates at the
constitutional convention they're pretty
impressive
so
not demeaning the individuals but their
class origins were very explicit
so it's understandable that the
constitution was set up as a coup
by the wealthy against democracy which
started as a serious danger
he didn't want to have the public the
what alexander hamilton called the great
beast
they can only cause trouble
and that goes on in democratic theory
right into the 20th century to
give you details but it's basically the
it's basically what's called liberal
democratic theory
liberal democratic theory i'm not
talking about the harsh reports
that basically holds that
the public i'll quote walter lippmann's
leading
liberal intellectual of the 20th century
public intellectual
he's a wilson
roosevelt kennedy liberal
he wrote a lot about
a
formation of government
his view
quoted was that
the public have to be put in their place
as spectators not participants
and the responsible men
the elites have to be protected from the
roar and the trampling of the bewildered
herd
others agreed like uh reinhold niebuhr
who's
greatly respected as sometimes called
the theologian of the establishment
liberal establishment
his view was that
people are too stupid and ignorant
quoting to
enter into affairs of state
they have to be fed
necessary illusions
emotionally potent simplifications
in order to keep them in line so the
responsible men can act in the public
interest
you look at the foundations of political
science
take harold lasswell
one of the founders also
roosevelt liberal it says we should not
be
seduced by
democratic dogmatisms
about people being the
best judges of their own interests
they're not
that we are the responsible men
in the kennedy years they were called
the
technocratic
policy oriented elite
they are the ones who understand how to
do things just keep the people out of
this
and uh that's a the united states didn't
invent it you go back to the british
establishment of british democracy
a century earlier it's exactly the same
isn't this that entire
concept is very anti-human freedom the
idea that someone knows
what's best for you better than you know
yourself as an adult i mean this seems
to contradict
the very principles of democracy itself
it's intended to predict
democracy was considered as a danger
just hidden about it
you read hamilton
madison others they're quite
it's quite open
it goes beyond what i just said i mean
one of the reasons actually had to do
with inflation
that one of the big debates during the
constitutional convention
was whether states could issue paper
money
now the uh that would have led to
inflation
what was going on
the population wanted it
during the revolution
the population suffered badly
country was much worse off after the
victory than before it was costly
not just in money people than the
revolutionary army suffered their family
suffered
meanwhile the speculators benefited
enormously
there were speculators who
lent the
convention
wanting to keep fighting the war
they made huge profits
well
the population wanted inflation
which benefits
the debtors
arms
the lenders
they wanted to wipe out the speculative
gains
during the
revolutionary war and benefit themselves
that was one of the big issues in the
convention
and it was paper money was blocked
almost everywhere i think rhode island
may have kept it nobody else
so there seems to be perhaps this
endless struggle between
what free market participants are
selecting for themselves and what state
actors
are attempting to
provide structure to the market or some
element of coercion to preserve peace or
whatever it may be
is this something we could ever overcome
like you know i'm thinking through the
lens of of something like bitcoin if the
free market selects bitcoin as money and
and
uh disregards the central bank or or um
let's say selects bitcoin instead of the
central bank shouldn't we honor what the
market is choosing doesn't isn't that a
reflection of what most people want
no it's not that's a myth
the market doesn't reflect what most
people want
the more if one of the myths of
libertarianism
is that it's so it's not a myth but the
misleading parts is that it solves the
calculation problem that's supposed to
be a big achievement you know about this
economic calculation yes
and it does solve it
but the question that's not asked is
does it solve it in a sensible way
so let's imagine a society where
a small group where
say a hundred people are
multi-billionaires
and a million people are
barely surviving
well the market solves the calculation
problem by producing super yachts
for the millionaire billionaires and a
bag of potato chips for everyone else
yeah that does solve it it even gives
you pareto equilibrium
but is that what we want
who says the market solution is worth
anything
the merch market solution depends on
distribution of wealth
so then the alternative is some element
of coercion so who do we give the keys
to coerce
it's not coercion it's decisions by a
democratic society that this is the kind
of place we want to live in
nobody's being coerced
it's of course people who don't want to
live in a democratic society they'll be
coerced so for example people who say
uh i don't want to stop at a red light
okay they're being coerced
if you don't want to live by community
norms you can call that coercion
but the question is whether a community
has the right to democratically decide
here's the kind of society we want
markets are on the side like a
democratic community might decide to use
the market for informational purposes
you know tells you something give the
information you can use for decision
making
but
turning the market into some holy
institution is a joke
a business doesn't want it it's never
functioned
it would be totally destructive
society couldn't survive
if any if the market was instituted
in fact we see that right very obviously
right now
i mean suppose that
the market worked for
uh energy production
we'd all be dead
we'd all be
living off
fossil fuels as long as they exist and
pretty soon
life on earth would be over pretty soon
in fact
is totally destructive
doesn't pay any attention to
people's needs and rights
in fact we're facing that right now
with the
uh
external so-called external you know the
externalization of
costs that's inherent in markets
i mean there's all kind of claims you
could price it in but that's ridiculous
when you start to price it in it becomes
a bureaucracy so complex that you can't
even
imagine it
well my understanding is as as costs are
externalized it would again be the
integrity of private property rights
that would price in that externalization
so if you're dumping pollution in my
river
i could sue you or i could take some
legal recourse against you and that
would impute the cost of that
externalization
so if
if
exxonmobil
is heating up the atmosphere
and destroying
killing your children you can take exxon
mobil to court
good luck
yeah i would presume it would be class
action at that point
yeah first of all class action is
extremely difficult to organize and it's
now being bored
by the reactionary supreme court
these are all jokes
you can teach that in a seminar if you
like has nothing to do with life
i mean just look at and first of all
look at property where'd property come
from
go back property comes originally from
enclosures
violent enclosures
which took away the commons that were
commonly available to people
forcefully expelled people from them
handed them over to private ownership
goes down in the generations
uh properties or take something
right in front of our eyes
take the vaccine
let's take mederna for example they
created a vaccine
a couple of uh
executives are now super billionaires
where'd that come from
well
it came from
decades of research
investigation
paid for by the public at research
universities government laboratories
developing
the basic
the basis for the what became the mrna
mrna
technology modern it was a strong small
struggling company
they did they picked up
these
gifts huge gifts from the public
picked them up
turned them into something marketable
then because of the
radical anti-free trade
agreements
they get a monopoly pricing right on it
for a huge period
not only the product rate but even the
process rate
which means that
billions of people in the
third world can't produce it even though
they have institutions that could
because of our radical anti-free trade
principles of libertarians in the united
states which impose these rules
okay
and therefore they can become
a billionaire as well and it's good for
us like i had a modern vaccine i'm glad
i had it but it's deprived other people
are deprived that's the way a quasi
market
with massive government intervention
works so let me ask you
one last question here do you still
identify them as an anarcho-syndicalist
yeah
so what is the proper role of market and
state in that worldview
well
if you look at the literature their
anti-state
but that means adding a particular kind
of state
a state which is an instrument of class
rule
if you had a
democrat if you had a
society
in which say
institutions
were democratically controlled
say an enterprise that's producing
something would be controlled by the
participants democratically
they would run it they would pick
representatives
who could do special things
recallable if they don't like what
they're doing and so on and
same with communities democratically
controlled associations among them
free associations on
to higher levels maybe internationally
if you could have a society like that
uh these questions wouldn't arise
it would be
the community would decide freely and
democratically
in cooperation with others
with concern for the needs of others not
just
greed for myself not ayn rand
not milton friedman
but concern for
the needs
and uh
just rights of others in a society that
worked like that
you wouldn't you would have of course
coercion
meaning
say if somebody insists
i want to drive through a red light
community would have the right to
prevent them
actually that's a very live issue right
now
suppose that uh
workers in a restaurant
decide that they want a safe space
where
they can be safe from people spreading
covet
well
somebody says sarah palin last couple
days
i'm not going to accept that i'm going
to go into it even though i
i have i refuse to get vaccinated and
i'm infected i don't want to
well in that case i think coercion is
legitimate
just like somebody wants to drive
through red lights
but those are ways in which
communities can
create
a viable
healthy
functioning communities working for the
good of the general public
interesting so okay
just one last following question it
seems like the
this democratically selected
community environment this seems to be
this sounds to me a lot like the free
market where you're actually selecting
what you want by buying and selling
right if you buy a house you're saying i
want more houses you sell a car i want
less cars
how do we reconcile that than the market
to this
coerced
free market
everyone has a vote
and the vote depends on your wealth
so if you're a billionaire
you have a billion votes
if you're a homeless guy in the street
you have if you're lucky one vote in the
market
that's what's called a free market has
nothing like democracy it's the opposite
of democracy isn't the successful
entrepreneur though accountable to the
wishes of consumers to become wealthy
take successful entrepreneurs
like the modern billionaires
or like bill gates
or like uh take bill gates
i think he would frankly tell you what
happened
take your
i'm you probably have a laptop computer
maybe apple windows whatever it is
where'd that come from
same as the vaccines
decades of research
risky
inventive creative research
in the public sector
paid for by the public
research universities
like the one where i spent
almost my whole life
mit back in the 50s 60s i was part of
that people working developing the basis
of what became fun funny computers
of all publicly fun almost all publicly
funded
few exceptions
after many years
uh
it became possible
for steve jobs he was the first one to
figure out how to
turn this into something marketable
i think it was
1996 i think
when they were able to make a marketable
computer he made a contribution no doubt
the first apple computer were a
contribution
small contribution
the major contribution had already been
made
by the public
uh they don't get the profit
the system as it works is basically
public subsidy private profit
that's property rights then come along
the
uh
free for so-called free trade agreements
which are
radically anti-free trade and they add
on monopoly monopoly pricing rights
and the monopoly control
that's what we call the free market
so the
the public then is subsidizing the say
the research and development on the
computer as you described
through
a coercion right they're paying via
inflation or taxation is funding these
public subsidies that then steve jobs
makes marketable
it wasn't an inflationary period the 50s
and 60s i'm sorry i'm just referring to
taxation and inflation when i say
inflation i mean just expansion of the
currency supply they're both means of
government revenue
it's taxation yes
actually
very regressive taxation
because
even with the progressive income tax
taxation tends to be pretty flat yeah
but we do have a
regressive taxation system
which funds
the basic work that
creates the advanced society the future
it's pretty well in other countries they
call it industrial policy
we're not allowed to use that phrase
because we have a
uh ideology which claims that we're all
in favor of free markets
which is a joke but it's industrial
policy it's just
done in fact it's interesting to see the
way it was done
go back to the 50s and the 60s was
mostly done through the pentagon
the pentagon
is the one institution in the society
that congress doesn't question
the pentagon says we need more money
they get it
so the way to develop the high-tech
society
was to fund it through the pentagon
as yet
i was working in these places
the lab where i worked research live
electronics at mit
was 100 funded by the pentagon
they didn't pay any attention to what
you were doing it was perfectly free
they understood perfectly well you're
just
doing research development you know it's
a job
uh
didn't have to ask grant requests nobody
came around to see what you were doing
this was so extreme
that by the late 60s
congress began to take notice
in i think
1969 it must have been
uh there was uh mike mansfield senator
mansfield
passed legislation the mansfield
amendment
which said that anything funded by the
dod
has to have a
definite military purpose
before that
of course the military used it they use
everything
whatever you're doing in the military
use it
but it was the work itself had no really
specific military purpose
marginally
but the 69
amendment
at least officially changed that
i think the main change if anybody
researched it
it's my experience would be that what it
basically changed is the way people work
research grants
so instead of saying here's what i want
to do fund me
they said
here's what i want to do here's some way
maybe you could fancifully imagine using
it for the military then here's what i
want to do
interesting well
no
i want to be respectful of your time um
thank you so much for coming on you know
again
great debt of gratitude to you and your
work uh being an intellectual pioneer
and rebel in the world so thank you
thank you could you do this
if my audience wants to find out more
about you or your work where should they
go
it's a lot of books
that comes out regularly
am i
i have regular uh
pieces that come out and
uh
uh website sites like uh truth out for
example every couple of weeks other
places
lots of talks
whole dozens of books
they keep coming out
mostly small
small publishers marginal publishers big
publishers don't want
but to their
look up amazon you can find them all
wonderful well thank you again noam it's
been a pleasure to speak with you
