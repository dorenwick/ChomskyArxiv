greetings we're here with Professor Nome
chsky of MIT the most quoted living
author and I'd like to ask Nome a couple
questions about uh about Gaza since it's
in the news here we are we're we're it's
inauguration day we have new president
in office and can you tell us about the
chances for a reasonable settlement I
mean it's pretty straightforward
actually for 30 years there's been an
extremely broad International consensus
on the shape of a peaceful
Zone a little variation here and there
but the basic idea is uh there is an
international border called The Green
Line prune 67 border uh there should be
settlement on the international border
uh with the US formulation was uh minor
and mutual modifications so you
straighten out some curved lines and
that sort of thing uh maybe a little
exchange of territory uh but that's the
basis for the settlement and it should
be a peaceful settlement which
recognizes the rights of all states in
the region to live in peace and security
within recognized borders it's the
working of the main UN resolution uh and
other things about you know just how do
you work out Jerusalem you know what do
you say about refugees and there's
another range of things okay that's the
international
consensus uh it was brought to the UN
Security Council in
1976 by the Arabs states with the
support of the PLO the US vetoed it uh
they vetoed it again in 1980 I won't thr
through the whole record but it's a
record of us International
isolation uh to keep from implementing
the international consensus now the uh
the votes and Security Council of the US
just V in the general assembly the votes
are you know like 151 to three United
States Israel and martial Islands or
something like that uh and it runs right
up till today the Clinton offer some
people say well the Palestinians should
have just taken that could you comment
briefly on propaganda Clint see the two
Clinton offers and people only talk
about the first one the first one was at
Camp David in 2000 when the US and
Israel did make Israel never made an
offer but Clinton sort of made it kind
of a vague offer the Palestinians did
accept it which is true and Clinton
recognized shortly after that the author
was completely unacceptable to any
Palestinians and he then proposed what
are called his parameters that's in
December 2000 he said okay here the
parameters of solution little vague but
more forthcoming than the Kent David
offer which he knew that nobody could
possibly accept uh well he then made a
speech in which he said both sides have
accepted the parameters both sides have
reservations they met in Egypt in
tuba in January 2001 Clinton's last
month and the two sides negotiated and
they went Way Beyond the camp daav
agreement they came very close to a
resolution and in their last press
conference they said if we had a few
more days we could probably resolve
everything roughly in terms of the
international
consensus Israel terminated the
negotiations
prematurely end of that that's what
actually happened but that story is and
it's not it's it's not really debated I
me facts are very clear they're not
challenged but it's it's just doesn't
fit the party line so it's supressed
what you hear is what you said
Palestinians had this generous offer and
they refused it no the should have taken
it
the they were getting near a resolution
Israel terminated the negotiations wow
uh and you know that just you just can't
about that I it's like the references to
Hamas every statement about Hamas in the
Press it's a Iranian backed Hamas which
is intent on destroying Israel try to
find a statement that says
democratically elected Hamas which is
calling which is has joined the
international consensus on a two State
settlement which is the US are blocking
you can't find that statement even
regarding Iran most people aren't aware
that we went in there and overthrew
Muhammad mus attch and that the
hostilities that's when they started in
19 beyond that and as soon as Iran
overthrew the population overthrew the
Tyrant we' imposed the US supported
saying in a murderous war against Iraq
we supported it militarily
diplomatically well basically authorized
his use of chemical weapons which killed
hundreds of thousands of
Iranians the US Contin support Saddam
husin right through his wor
atrocities the Kurdish massacres the
Iranians we may not like to remember
that but they surely remember in fact
immediately after the war uh we imposed
harsh sanctions on them which have
remained so the United States have been
torturing Iran since
1953 we may not like to think about it
but you know they sure remember if
somebody had done it that that's sweet
remember so here we are on the day of
the inauguration and and we have uh
Barack Obama in it one thing I wanted to
say is that you know this whole uh the
divisions of mankind you and I have
discussed this before we all have a
common ancestor I mean so the these
whole kind not that I'm mean in
evolutionary terms it's pretty recent
right every one of us comes from a small
group in East Africa about 50,000 years
ago so last thing here we are at the
height of the information age and I
guess Elementary truths are still easily
varried somehow
very very easily okay thank you very
much no good to see you again
