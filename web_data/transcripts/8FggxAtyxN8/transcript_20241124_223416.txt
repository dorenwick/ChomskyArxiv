hang with the uh the intellectuals for a
second um to make it more concrete can
you give some examples of just a few or
as many as you want of people who you
think do fulfill the responsibility of
intellectuals let's say in the United
States or maybe um and and what makes
you say that about the particular person
what makes me say it is that they do the
specific people oh well let's take
Howard in who died recently or ekbal
Ahmed who died a couple years earlier or
Edward SED who died shortly before Eko
uh well these are happen to be old
personal friends but they were also uh
Edward and ebal were very close friends
eel and Howard were close friends
and interacted constantly so they were
kind of a Cadre if you like of U
prominent uals Scholars activists their
lives and their work were intimately
intertwined and they dedicated a large
part of their lives and work to pursuing
Elementary moral truisms that could run
through them but that's what they did so
okay that's responsible intellectuals
okay maybe a way to to see it is some
intellectuals but not journalists
because we're going to get to journalism
in a minute who fail Mis miserably um
who have the prestige who have the
access who have all the characteristics
that you describe as associated with
being an intellectual but who um don't
meet their responsibility violate it
routinely that's I mean I know there are
a lot you want to start from a we we'll
go on for the rest of the day it's
virtually
