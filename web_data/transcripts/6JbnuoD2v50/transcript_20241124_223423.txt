here's a question will U.S society and
its economy be uh
reformed without direct action militants
and revolution
well you know talk about I want you to
think through these things carefully
let's think about a revolution
I mean if a revolution is going to be at
all constructive not not just establish
some horrible dictatorship worse than
you happened there's only one way it can
come about
that's if a large mass of the population
in fact the larger majority come to
recognize that changes that they want
cannot be instituted within the
framework of existing institutions
that means that if you're a real
dedicated revolutionary you're a
reformist
there's no conflict between reform and
Revolution what you want to do is press
the institutions as far as possible
to yield to just popular demands and if
the population comes to recognize look
it can't be done anymore
okay then you can talk about a
revolution but not before
and if you look at people who are really
interested in revolutions like Karl Marx
they they press this all the time in
fact he even believed that in the uh in
England you know country that entered
the most the freest country of his day
parliamentary system in England the
United States might be possible to
establish a Communist Revolution without
any violence at all
just by pressing forward within the
framework of the institutions that they
have well maybe so maybe not but that's
the Criterion
so I think
just again endure sweat
Juan and Amy said you have to try in
every possible way to
bring the
the changes bring about the changes that
we think ought to be made by means that
are available and going back to occupy I
agree with Amy it was a tremendous
achievement but there's a gap
the 99 percent have to participate
uh and that hasn't been achieved and
that's pretty important it's good it's
good to bring it to public attention put
it on the national agenda get people to
think about it but that's only the first
step the next step is to engage the 99
and that's
a hard task just as it has been with
every popular movement and you have to
remember if you look at the history of
popular movements they have had
successes I mean it was a much Freer
Jester country than it was not that long
ago but it's always partial successes
