[Music]
good
evening thank
you everybody for coming to hear gnome
at this very critical
juncture um it's an honor of course to
introduce n chamski it's actually a very
easy job because I don't have to say
anything and especially to this crowd in
the People's Republic of
Cambridge and but I should just say to
do due diligence that Professor chamski
is professor emeritus of linguistics at
MIT and also holds this prestigious
position of the Institute Professor but
more than that he is suffice to say is
often described as America's greatest
public intellectual so welcome Nome uh
tonight uh I understand um uh Nome is
going to talk about what he has title
that talk is after the Electoral
Extravaganza well it's continuing and
the show is going to go on so be great
to hear gome on this well in my opinion
this is a
historical uh campaign season uh not for
the reasons that you'd hear from the
mainstream media but for the reason of
the tremendous mobilization of people
that we have seen a working people maybe
they're not going in the right direction
all the time but regardless this is a
mobilization that we haven't seen uh
since I would say and I wasn't here in
1968 but the convention in Chicago I I
um it it brings me back to those days
because somebody I think it was uh U
mayor uh or is it renel who's a governor
of Pennsylvania just comment made a
comment saying that better watch out
these uh delegates from uh Bernie better
better fall in line so I just reminded
me of the situation in Chicago but the
situation is now is is is is is
different uh um but what I think is
happening and as uh Professor chsky will
definitely talk about the issues that he
talks about are not in the in the
mainstream media which are also not the
real issues that people face and some of
these are uh the issues that uh Mass
peace action is working very closely one
of them is the people's budget we have a
budget in the United States I come
originally from the defense industry I'm
a whistleblower before arriving at MIT
and the defense budget is a $600 billion
budget that makes this weapons makes
profits for the companies and and makes
our foreign policy so much dependent on
the militarism that we have seen but we
we have also we can take some credit and
mass PE peace action was very much
involved to move the policy against
another War for instance against Iran so
we now have an Iran deal and we have a
lot of work in front of us because a lot
of people are are sabotaging that uh
continuously uh today uh we are also
involved in fighting Wars in general and
stopping a other um military actions in
in in Syria to give diplomacy uh a
chance so
and and professor chsky and our last uh
uh um get together at MIT talked about
the connection of this military spending
and climate change so all of these are
not talked about even Bernie Sanders is
not talking too much about the military
budget that we have to attack that to
solve our problems so thank you very
much for coming without much further Ado
Professor ch
[Music]
[Applause]
uh well I'll uh pickups from suba's last
comments uh we're all familiar with the
uh Sherlock Holmes story about the dog
who didn't bark and we're now
experiencing uh remarkable and uh reveal
in example of that uh Curious phenomenon
namely the Electoral campaign in the
most powerful country in world history
uh the leader of the so-called free
world uh as I'm sure you know since
1947 the bulletin of the atomic
scientists has uh uh take has displayed
a a Doomsday Clock where the hands are a
certain distance from midnight Midnight
means
termination the hands move up and back
depending on world
circumstances uh last year they were
moved 2 minutes closer to
midnight 3 minutes from Midnight closest
it's been since a major war scare in the
early
1980s stayed there this year and they
explained uh that there are two reasons
for that uh one reason is the growing
threat of nuclear war which means
terminal War and the other of course is
environmental
catastrophe well anyone with eyes open
must be aware of the severity of threats
to these to survival literally just to
give a few illustrations right now at
the Russian border the US run NATO
alliance is rapidly building up its uh
offensive forces in fact planning to
quadruple them it's a huge increase
Russians are reacting in kind uh here's
the way the confrontation is described
in in the Press happens to be the New
York Times a couple days ago so I'll
quote by sharp by sharply ramping up
so-called intercepts of American ships
and planes in Central and Eastern Europe
Russia is demonstrating its anger over
the increased American Military presence
in a region it considers part of its
backyard White House officials said they
call the Russian actions
harassment that's one way of looking at
it uh another way of looking at it is
that it's not on the Mexican border it's
on the Russian border the traditional
Invasion route through which Russia has
been virtually destroyed several times
in the past Century many times before in
fact if it had come anywhere near the
Mexican border we wouldn't be around to
talk about it we've had would have had a
nuclear war a long time ago uh the
background to the uh Russian harassment
on the Russian border as the state
department sees it is uh the very very
rapid NATO expansion that took place as
soon as the Soviet Union collapsed back
25 years ago uh the there were
alternative visions of a future system
presented one presented by
gorbachov representing the Russian views
was that there would be a a general
Eurasian security system all both
military blocks would
disappear there would be centers in
Brussels
Moscow Ankara FL of AO in a joint Global
Security system in peace and Amity that
was rejected by the West uh in favor
of uh maintaining not only maintaining
NATO but rapidly expanding it it's kind
of interesting that that passed without
comment
since NATO's origin the justification
for it had been very simple it's
necessary to protect the Western Europe
from the aggressive Russian hordes no
more Russian hordes so what happens to
Nato it
expands uh first under Bush number one
to East Germany then under Clinton right
to the Russian borders then on uh in the
last few years there have been
invitations from NATO 2008
2013 invitations to Ukraine which is
right at the geopolitical heartland of
any
Russian strategic analyst and of course
long historical and cultural ties
invitations to join NATO as well well
the threat that this would pose was
under stood right away right at the very
beginning George Kenan other senior
Statesmen described this as a tragic
mistake uh policy error of historic
proportions uh now leading to the point
of major conflict very likely major
conflict if you read the arms control
journals they warn that both sides are
acting as if a war is thinkable
they're laying plans for war and they're
preparing for it and anyone who's paid
any attention to the shocking record of
the last 70 years should be aware that
it's literally a miracle that we've
survived I mean the record of
near uh termination is just outlandish
uh new cases keep being discovered a
couple of months ago it was revealed
that that uh in 1979 under Carter uh the
US automated response systems which make
hundreds of Errors the Russian ones
undoubtedly or even worse uh the
automated response systems which are
supposed to detect an incoming missile
attack it did detect a Russian missile
attack and protocol is it goes up to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff they approve a
response goes to the National secur
security advisor then speak of pinski he
calls the president he launches the
missiles and we say goodbye to each
other because it's well known by now
been for years that a a first strike by
a major nuclear power is going to
essentially be terminal just from the
effects of nuclear winter alone uh
brinsky was on the phone calling Carter
to launch a strike when the information
came in that it was just one of the many
hundreds of false alarms there's been
case after case like that that's quite
apart from highly adventurist actions by
the political leaders which they knew
might lead to nuclear war but proceeded
anyway the cases are pretty
amazing uh the threat of serious nuclear
war is understood by Leading figures one
of them who's been outspoken recently is
U William Perry was Former Defense
secretary conservative nuclear
specialist on nuclear Affairs taken
quite seriously he's warned repeatedly
that the threat of nuclear war today is
greater than it was even during the
Reagan years and that's pretty plausible
in fact the just the fact that a nuclear
war is even considered thinkable is
really really an astonishing commentary
on human
imbecility again the first a first
strike the attacker would be destroyed
there's no question about that uh and to
regard to be planning for something like
this is you can't find words to describe
it but it's happening and something
similar is happening in the China Seas
where us uh there very serious US
provocations military vessels going
within what the Chinese regard as
territorial Waters comparable to what we
would describe recently a nuclear
capable B52 by accident flew over a CH
an island that the Chinese claim these
things it's it's less threatening in uh
Asia because China doesn't have much of
a retaliatory Capac capacity but they're
going to develop it and if the
provocations go on they'll develop it
and we'll be in deeper trouble and as
you know I'm sure the Obama
Administration is planning a huge uh uh
what's called Improvement in the nuclear
posture a trillion doll expenditures to
build up much more lethal and
threatening new nuclear weapons
including uh we small weapons with a
small yield which are particularly
dangerous because there'll be a
temptation to use them and all you have
to do is use one and it escalates out of
sight well that's uh that's brief look
at U what's happening in the world of
nuclear weapons what's happening in the
primaries the dog is completely silent
no barking nobody on any side is saying
a word about it except for strident
calls repeated today from the Republican
establishment to build up the nuclear
weapon system and the whole military
even Beyond its extraordinary
proportions today we didn't get reports
from the Ryan Trump meetings but you
could be pretty sure that U among the
things they agreed on was that that's
one of the points they have in common
that's kind of an interesting proposal
if you look at it both Trump and Ryan
Ryan is more dangerous than Trump in my
opinion because he's taken seriously but
if you look at the proposals the actual
numbers uh the call is let's increase
the military budget let's sharply reduce
taxes particularly on the rich uh no
other sources of revenue the military
budget is already over 50% of
discretionary spending the just do the
arithmetic there's nothing left any part
of the government that might be of any
benefit to the
population disappears that's just
arithmetic of course there's all kind of
Mythology about how there's going to be
amazing growth and so on but we can
forget that uh that's quite apart from
the consequences of building up the
military budget like uh quadrupling the
NATO stance in on the Russian border and
another trillion doll expansion of the
nuclear program well the Doomsday Clock
partially one of it's cons one of the
reasons the minute hand is moving closer
to midnight is that the other one is
environment there the threats are no
less severe and the Silence of the dog
is equally dramatic uh almost nothing
being said about it a few words here and
there
and it's very serious I don't have to
stress that for you this is the first
time in human history ever 200,000 years
of the history of the species when we
have to ask the question are we going to
uh uh take steps to guarantee at least
extend the possibility of decent
survival not in the distant future for
our children and grandchildren that's
the question and of course we've already
answered that question for innumerable
other species the uh level of species uh
extinction because of global warming is
at the level of the so-called fifth
Extinction 65 million years ago when uh
an asteroid hit the earth huge asteroid
that caused the catastrophe ended the
age of the
dinosaurs uh opened the way for the rise
of mammals ultimately us and we're now
paying our respects by becoming the
asteroid the level of U species
destruction is back to that level and
we're next uh the uh uh I I mean every
issue of a science journal gives more
chilling prospects I'll just read a
couple but you can find them every time
you open a new science journal there's a
new study in nature
geosciences found that the pace of
environmental change now is faster than
at any previous time in the world's
history maybe at least a 100 times maybe
a thousand times as fast uh you've
probably seen the report by James Hansen
18 co-authors they studied the last time
time that the world warmed naturally
that's about 120,000 years ago pretty
similar temperatures uh much of the
Polar Ice
disintegrated and uh they've established
that the sea level Rose about 20 to 30
ft uh that's where we are now but that
was over a long period uh this is
immediate much more rapidly they
estimate that the worst case could be
maybe 50 years
uh followed by increases so precipitous
quoting now that they would force
Humanity to be a hasty Retreat from the
coasts loss of all coastal cities the
real catastrophe would be soon in places
like Bangladesh a coastal plane where
billions of people are without
sustenance or opportunities for
survival uh the uh uh virt all the land
ice on the planet has already started to
melt much more rapidly than was expected
and the melting of the Arctic Ice which
is taking place quite rapidly will also
release a vast amounts of methane into
the atmosphere that's uh in short in the
short term much more lethal than CO2
that drives the crisis onward just last
example another study
investigated a period that's called the
paleocene eosine thermal maximum 60
million years ago there was at that time
a natural CO2 release drove strong
warming that caused I'm quoting
amplifying feedbacks dwarfing of large
animals ecosystem disruptions soil
degreg water cycle shifts other major
changes and again that was over a much
longer time time likely to be more
severe that one affected the Earth for
more than 100,000 years and today would
be utterly
catastrophic uh another threat very much
alive right now is drought it's
happening all over uh couple days ago
the Press reported that uh in
India quote much of India is reeling
from a heat wave and severe drought
conditions that have decimated crops
killed livestock and left at least 330
million Indians without enough water for
their daily needs uh that's now just
think what happens when the Himalayan
glaciers have melted eliminating the
water supply for South Asia I mean if
anybody thinks there's a refugee crisis
now in fact there isn't but if you
believe that imagine what happens when
this goes on well what's the dog doing
nothing
uh the Democrats you get a couple of
polite comments very little that's
serious in the case of the Republicans
there's not much talk but there's some
and the few remarks are pretty serious
every single Republican candidate denies
that it's happening with a single
exception Cas who says yeah it's
happening but we shouldn't do anything
about it so we have he's the smart guy
that everybody Praises so that's 100%
agreement on the part of the political
party that controls Congress that either
it's not happening or we don't do
anything about it we should not regulate
emissions so in short Let's Race to the
precipice as quickly as we can uh I
should say that the dog is not only
silent in the primaries uh you may have
seen a report that green piece released
a couple days ago they somehow got hold
of 280 pages from the latest so-called
tra Trade Agreement the transatlantic
trade and investment
partnership investor rights agreement
masquerading as free trade the
provisions have a very harsh effect on
climate and they point out that in these
280 Pages the phrase climate change does
not appear doesn't matter take a look at
the business press same story a lot of
talk in the last couple days about the
plans of Saudi Arabia to reshape their
economy they the biggest oil producer
front page of the New York Times you
know Financial Times and so on a lot of
discussion of the possible consequences
so will it cause oil prices to rise
which could harm American consumers who
are worried about whether they can drive
enough this summer one problem or will
cause oil prices to drop which has the
negative effect of driving American
shell producers out of the market uh
most highly polluting uh fossil fuel
extraction there is outside of
tarand something's missing not a word
about the effect on the
climate uh that's and it's well
understood that unless almost all the
fossil fuels are left in the ground
we're pretty much doomed
but the dog is silent that's very common
when fossil fuels are discussed at all
so if you happen to take a look at
today's New York Times the business
section the lead article is about the
huge forest fires in Canada in Alberta
the forest fires are probably the effect
of global warming and they're
accelerating it for the obvious reason
they're destroying a major carbon sink
and the article what the article is
worried about though is something
different the forest fires are slowing
down
temporarily extraction of tar Sands oil
the absolute worst kind and they're
concerned is this going to harm the
Canadian economy there's good
news pouring resources in to make sure
that the tar Sands are lifted as oil is
lifted as quickly as possible so maybe
won't be too bad a problem a dog is
Silent not a word about the climate
change effects uh well what are we doing
about it in
2009 the uh nations of the world agreed
to limit planetary warming to 2° C above
the pre-industrial level uh that's we've
already reached about half that amount
2015 last December uh there was a major
con International Conference in Paris uh
it aimed at reaching a treaty that would
establish limits on carbon emission the
limits were much too high but at least
it would have been something but they
couldn't do it and they couldn't do it
for a very simple reason it's called the
Republican Congress which would not
permit a treaty so therefore it's a
voluntary agreement which means nothing
happens uh couple of weeks after that
the Republicans in the Supreme Court uh
barred very mild restrictions that had
been proposed on uh carbon emission uh
the uh uh it's a message to the world
that says we're not going to do anything
so you don't do anything either and
again every Republican including Kasich
says don't do anything about it either
it's not happening or if it is happening
who cares uh eliminate the EPA stop
regulation Let's Race to the precipice
that's what we want to do it's quite an
amazing comment on the human species if
you think about it it's
uh it's the this is the one species in
history that has achieved what we call
higher intelligence
and this is the way it's being
used uh there in fact it would not be an
exaggeration to say that the and this
should be headlines in every newspaper
that today's Republican organization is
the most dangerous organization in human
history literally for this reason alone
and there's others that's what the
headlines should be reading and the
Democrats are not that different well
there is a bright side the bright side
is that much of the population is well
ahead of the political
leadership there is a very strong case
that U without a carbon tax uh the
situation is almost hopeless and uh at
least According to some polls that's
there's some pretty remarkable results
one recent poll found that almost half
of the population in the United States
does support a carbon tax which is
pretty remarkable since articulate
support is very low mostly opposition if
it's mentioned at all and Elite
opposition to it is just
overwhelming uh no less remarkable is
the fact that uh a majority in every
state supports regulation of
CO2 that's true even in the so-called
red States and it's alleged that in
every every congressional district a
majority favors requiring utilities to
use clean energies uh those are hopeful
prospects they can be built on and there
is substantial popular activism
worldwide the question whether it will
prevail is the most important question
that has ever Arisen in the history of
the human species and it's going to be
answered by people like you and pretty
soon
thanks thank you for your remarks um
what do you feel is the most important
action the people can take to turn back
these destructive forces voting is not
it what else do you recommend voting
should take is it's worth doing I mean
to keep the uh basically for one reason
to make sure that the Republicans don't
get into office because the danger that
they pose cannot be
overestimated it should take about five
minutes of our time to think about it
and another 10 minutes to do it and then
you go back to the serious work uh which
is what ought to be going on all the
time uh working
to take
these popular attitudes as long as
people just that I mentioned when people
just think them doesn't matter very much
if they're organized mobilized energized
to do something about it uh whether it's
uh lobbying in Congress or
demonstrations
or Civil Disobedience or whatever it
might be then it means something and
that's the way every positive change in
history has taken place so fine you know
vote it's okay but meanwhile go ahead
and do what's
important thank
you uh thank you Professor chsky for
your wonderful presentation so channels
of communication I think are becoming
very very important in like channels of
communication like mass media Electronic
media social media
and uh what would you like Envision how
is it going to develop a lot of the
times people now talk about
scientification of Journalism or
scientification of media meaning that
they bring like hard evidence and
numbers and data and scientific study
results to prove the point so would you
think that if media and education
institutions get together they will
voice
um how their voice will be heard better
by politicians and you were talking
about the psychological catastrophes and
dooming day so how would you envision
the future role of media and science
getting together in this direction well
first of all I mean on the on both the
environmental crisis and uh the nuclear
issues the uh the science and the
professional journals and associations
are pretty straight but they don't reach
many people they reach a small sector of
uh educated opinion and that has to
reach the public and it's not going to
reach the public through the media uh
what I described as pretty typical
they're not going to reach the public
through the electoral process again what
I described is pretty typical the dog
doesn't bark so how does it reach the
public through people like you um what's
been found over the years and what is
indeed uh shown in careful studies is
that the most important mode of
organization is face-to-face contact I
mean that actually shows even uh in
political
campaigns uh there was an interesting
study recently by uh Andrew
Coburn very good military analyst
journalist uh Pon the Atlantic I think
in which he reviewed a series of studies
comp deter kind of analyzing how
political
spending uh influences
elections turns out that the impact is
pretty slight that people don't pay much
attention to television ads but what has
an enormous effect is
canvasing going do door too and talking
to people that there turns out to have a
huge impact incidentally this doesn't
mean that the political spending is
wasted by the people who are spending it
because remember that they're not just
trying to get their candidate in they
are buying something very precious
called access if you fund a political
candidate that candidate's doors are
open to your lobbyists and corporate
lawyers who can go in and write the
legislation
that the candidate ultimately will sign
halftime without reading it that's the
way the legislative process works and it
also does have an impact on U on on the
electoral process but what really has a
Major Impact is talking to
people and that means local organization
expanding to National and international
organization and we know that from
history just take a look at the major
achievements of say even the past
generation so the Civil Rights Movement
women's rights uh opposition to nuclear
weapons environmental concerns it all
developed this way and that goes way
back to abolitionism and you know
overthrowing the feudal system as far
back as you go so that's what has to be
done and it's really a job for every
everyone wherever you happen to be
whatever oper opportunities you
have um Professor chamy um first um I'd
like to thank you very much for um for
your time and um uh before I um give my
uh question I'd just like to um uh say
thank you um especially for your
documentary released on um American
foreign policy on Netflix because um uh
that's what inspired me to um pursue a
career in politics and also um become uh
quite a huge fan of you since my uh
freshman year I'm now a junior small
correct they're not my documentaries
they're the documentaries of the people
who do them I'm kind of like the moon in
a documentary about the moon I don't
have anything to do with thank you and
they deserve the credit of
course and um also uh forgive me this
question might call for um a bit of
speculation but um you have um I'm sure
everyone in this room knows you've
described yourself um as an anarchist in
the past and we we're all aware of from
how you define anarchism it's very
sensible and logical but um in you've um
highlighted a lot of um problems that we
face not only you know like as a country
but as a human species and um in an
anarchist Society um How could a lot of
these um problems be solved in probably
maybe a more Superior manner
too that depends on uh your faith in
human beings so for example if decision
are in the hands of an informed public
which has which participates in
structures of cooperation and mutual Aid
uh are you likely to have more uh
humanly uh benign consequences than if
they're made by a group of corporate
lobbyists uh state state bureaucrats and
so um dictators and so on it's a guess
but I think it's a pretty safe guess
thank
you hi thank you for speaking with us
this evening it it's really a pleasure
to hear you talk yep no worries um so
you mentioned that the military budget
is increasing and that I'm not sure if
that's your speculation that it's
increasing for nuclear weaponry or
that's some well to get the fact
straight it's now about 53% of
discretionary spending okay the U Obama
Administration has called for a rapid
increase trillion dollars over the next
couple decades in uh uh modernizing and
developing the nuclear component uh I
think just about every every Republican
candidate certainly Trump and Ryan the
two major ones have called for
substantial increases in the military
budget they don't give numbers but
substantial okay so given that um How
would you characterize Obama's planned
visit to Hiroshima his visit to
Hiroshima well it's about 70 years too
late right I mean
aside and depends what you
know depends how it's handled but I mean
this was a real Watershed in human
history I mean the Hiroshima bombing
told everyone who was listening
that we're from now on we're fa we are
facing destruction I remember it very
well won't talk about it personally but
uh it was a shattering uh at disclosure
in fact the atomic scientists themselves
really hadn't thought about it very much
turns out they knew that there was a
possibility that it could
instantaneously destroy life on Earth if
it happened to set off reactions that
would expand but uh and it was pretty
horrible the way it was and remember
that was a very small Bomb by
contemporary standards and it's quite
interesting to look at the developments
since that time this goes back to your
question about Elites and the
population so there is a kind of a
standard history of scholarly history of
the nuclear weapon system by McGeorge
Bundy former Harvard Dean who was
National Security advisor for Kennedy
and Johnson you know kind of liberal
side of the spectrum and he was given
access to highest level documents and so
on and and the book's interesting
reading but I think the most interesting
part again is the part where the dog
doesn't bark now there's one paragraph
in the book around the middle which I
don't think historians have ever even
commented on which is just mindboggling
what here's what he says he says around
1950 the US of course had overwhelming
uh Power just way ahead of the Russians
technologically far ahead of everyone
else unbelievable
security but there was one Potential
Threat to the United States at that
point potential uh icbms International
intercontinental ballistic missiles with
advanced hydrogen bomb Warheads they
didn't exist but in the course of time
they would exist and he points out that
he was unable to find any comment even a
staff paper by someone suggesting maybe
we should try to stop it and maybe we
should try to enter into a treaty with
the Russians to ban the development of
the only weapons that could wipe us out
immediately apparently nobody cared was
it a possibility very likely the
Russians I said were way behind even
Stalin at the time was making
significant gestures calling for some
kind of negotiations and settlement in
fact one crucial
offer remember pretty well in March 19
52 was an offer from the Russians to uh
permit Germany to be unified Germany's
of course an incredible threat to Russia
just take a look at the history this is
right after the second world war permit
Germany to be unified allowed Democratic
elections internationally supervised
which the Communists are sure to lose
and the West will win on one condition
that Germany not join a hostile military
Alliance it was pretty interesting what
happened the information was withheld
for a while so that Truman could put
through a huge increase in the military
budget it was finally released but kind
of dismissed with as kind of a joke you
know who can take that seriously and
anyone who mentioned it was just
ridiculed well now the Russian archives
have come out that turns out it was
pretty serious and the mainstream
historians including very anti-communist
ones like Adam mulam Harvard agreed that
could have been serious and there were
other such possibilities but they were
simply dismissed and disparaged in the
interests of building up a massive
military system to intimidate the world
and pursue our interests and the the
idea that we might do something to
protect the people of the United States
from destruction doesn't seem to have
Arisen literally and if you look over
the history that happens time after time
uh that's the kind of decisions that are
made by political and economic Elites so
for it's kind of comparable to when
Exxon Mobile decides to suppress the
information that they have from their
own
scientists uh that if we continue what
we're doing we're going to destroy the
human species but let's keep quiet about
it it because it's more important to
make profit tomorrow those are the kinds
of decisions that you find all through
modern history and in fact you know
going way back uh and
uh these are the core issues that just
have to be
overcome thank you very
much uh Professor chsky much like
everybody else said thank you very much
for your time and for for your Shar BR
your knowledge with us I was just
curious what your opinion was given the
fact that International treaties for the
most part are kept um you know
unfulfilled and those that are fulfilled
are generally binding agreements such as
the tppa that are negotiated in private
and their effect of the environment is
highly detrimental but because of their
secretive nature we as the quote unquote
elected the electorate don't have access
to them and don't have input what can we
do so that we can voice the concerns
that these International agreements that
would bind us um pose to our day-to-day
lives well that first of we can demand
access now that's the kind of work
that's being done by Major criminals
some of the leading criminals in the
world that the US government is
dedicating enormous resources to trying
to capture and silence are people like
uh Julian Assange and Edward Snowden who
are breaking the rules seriously the
rules are exactly what you said power
has to be protected from scrutiny
because if people know what the powerful
are doing they're not going to like it
so therefore it has to be kept
secret uh former uh professor of the
science of government at Harvard Samuel
Huntington noted liberal analyst and
Scholar once said that uh forget his
exact words he put it rather nicely that
uh
power must be kept in the shadow if
exposed to the sunlight it begins to
evaporate and he even gave an example he
said uh through since the Truman
Doctrine throughout the Cold War uh we
had to the US government had to pretend
that it was the Soviet Union that we
were fighting whenever we intervened
anywhere otherwise you wouldn't get
popular support for it if you say you're
intervening to prevent democracy and
freedom and uh human rights uh people
aren't going to Rally to it but if you
tell them the Russians are coming yeah
then they will and rather
strikingly it's pretty striking what I
mentioned before what happened to Nato
that was only one of a number of crucial
things that happened right at the time
of the collapse of the Soviet Union and
that's kind of interesting that the uh
the media the educational system
scholarship kind of ignore it but if you
want to understand what the Cold War was
about the best place to look clearly is
what happened when it
ended okay Russians are gone for 50
years everything was done because the
Russians are coming okay no Russians
what happens we expand NATO uh there
were the Bush Administration Bush one at
the time of course came out with a new
National Security
strategy uh said pretty much everything
will go on as before but with new
pretexts so we still have to have a huge
military system and not to defend
ourself against the Russians they're not
there but because of I'm quoting the
technological sophistication of third
world powers that's why we have to have
this huge military system uh they said
we have to maintain what they call the
defense industrial base that's a
euphemism for the high-tech economy
which is funded by the taxpayer and
what's called a market system in which
taxpayers pay the costs of research and
development and Innovation over long
periods and if anything comes out
decades later it's handed over to
private Enterprise for marketing and
profit computers internet satellites so
we have to maintain the defense
industrial base actually one of the most
interesting comments was about the
Middle East said we have to
maintain intervention forces directed at
the Middle East this is 1990 and you
know what happened since
why it said in the we have aimed at the
Middle East then came this interesting
phrase where the serious problems we
faced could not have been laid at the
kremlin's
door in other words we've been lying to
you for 50 years it wasn't the Russians
it was what's called radical nationalism
independent
nationalism had to follow Huntington's
advice and pretend it was the Russians
but in fact the problems couldn't be
laid at the Kremlin store uh it goes on
like that NATO was not only expanded to
the east its mission was changed
officially to be a global Mission uh
what they call defending meaning
controlling the International Energy
System pipelines and sea Lanes all of
this tells you an awful lot about
Foreign Affairs did you study it in
school did you read it in the media do
you find it in scholarly journals I mean
it's there same on the uh trade great
agreement uh what green pieace just
released basically tells us what any
rational person knew these are investor
rights agreements they have almost
nothing to do with trade nothing at all
to do with free trade uh enormous
protectionist measures protection of
investor rights uh and of course they
have to be negotiated in secret you
can't tell people that uh but you see
when people say they're negotiated in
secret it's a little misleading they not
secret to the corporate lobbyists and
lawyers who are writing the legislation
they're the ones writing the details to
make sure it comes out correctly for
their interests so they know about it
and their corporate Masters know about
it and of course government bureaucrats
know about it it's just you're not
supposed to know about it and then uh
it's supposed to be passed by a system
that's called Fast Track
and every reasonable person supposed to
be in favor of Fast Track what's Fast
Track stalinist style legislation the
government gives you gives Congress a
choice yes or no no discussion no debate
which of course means yes that's the
height of democracy well do we have to
accept that and it's across the
board case after case don't have to
accept it and notice that the people who
tried to break it like Snowden Assange
Manning they they are some of the
leading criminals in the world huge
resources are devoted to trying to
capture them if you can to get rid of
them sequest of them somehow I don't
know if how much the extent to which
this is done is kind of shocking like
Snowden finally made it to Russia and U
couple of years ago the
he would like to go to Latin America we
could get
Asylum uh the Bolivian president Eva
Morales flew to Russia for just
negotiations of some kind and uh as he
flew back to Bolivia the European
countries under threat from the United
States of course would not permit the
plane to cross their
airspace which is pretty shocking the
plane was finally forced down in aus
Austria and it was immediately invaded
by Austrian police to see if this Arch
criminal was trying to escape I mean
that's the and Assange just I think it's
now four years has been locked up in a
room basically I visit them there it's
actually worse than being in prison
can't even go outside you know uh but
but these people cannot be permitted to
survive they're much too dangerous
because they're trying to lift the Veil
to help people know what's going on and
that's really dangerous and if you uh
anyone who's spent time going through uh
AR archives you know Declassified
documents you very quickly discover that
almost nothing has anything to do with
National Security in any serious sense
it's mostly security of power against
the domestic public the primary enemy
and it is an enemy CU if they know
what's going on they're not going to
allow it which tells us what we ought to
be
doing get people to know what's going on
it's possible thank
you so um as everyone else said I just
wanted to say thanks for speaking um I
guess my question is a little more
abstract in the sense that um
it's more about the cognitive dissonance
that many of my generation feel
surrounding what we're told about
climate change versus how we're told to
live our lives in the sense that we're
still encouraged to uh have children
we're still encouraged to continue
consuming and unsustainable ways um uh
pursue careers in spite of the fact that
we're also taught in the same
institutions that are encouraging us to
go on have careers live our lives um
that uh sort of catastrophic climate
change at this point is almost
inevitable um so I guess my question is
do you have any advice for dealing with
that intense cognitive dissonance and
not be paralyzed by uh the sense that
there's nothing we can do and uh our
generation is basically doomed to
inherit an intractable
problem we're only your generation is
only doomed if it decides to be doomed
there's plenty that can be done it's by
no means a foro conclusion now there
have been much harder problems in human
history even recently that have been
overcome uh you can name any number of
them I mean take a one of the real
achievements of the past generation
women's rights back in the 1950s it's
not that it looked impossible the
question doesn't wasn't a ra wasn't ra
raised it happened uh take uh
anti-Semitism at Harvard which people
like to talk about it was real at one
point when I was a student in 1950 it
was very real there was almost no Jewish
faculty two or three people in fact one
of the reasons MIT became a great
University is because people like
Norbert weiner superb mathematician
couldn't get jobs at Harvard so they
went to the engineering school down the
street you know uh that's the kind of
thing that's happened throughout human
history uh late 19th century Irish were
basically treated like African-Americans
which is the absolute lowest you can get
uh you could read signs in Boston
restaurants saying no dogs are
Irish years later they took over a large
part of the political system they get
presidents and so on there are things
that can be done always and there are
things that can be done about this and
it was it would have been easy all say
for
abolitionists I mean that was a
horrifying struggle they could have
easily given up but some of them didn't
and finally worked and the same's true
now except now it happens to be more
urgent even than any of those cases
because it is a question of survival so
there's no reason not to go on with your
life every reason to continue in fact
that's where you get the sources of
sustenance and strength to do the
political work that you need so that
makes good sense but there's we have a
lot of opportunities we have a legacy
that has been W by our predecessors we
can start from a higher platform a lot
of things have been won already we don't
have to fight about them anymore gives
it a chance to go
on hi professor I my name is ibraim I'm
a student at Boston University I just
had uh two questions um my first is do
you have any advice on how we can make
our businesses as well as Urban
Development sustainable and socially
responsible and then my second question
is what can we do as Educators as well
as college students to encourage Youth
Empowerment and Civic
engagement well um if you take the
second question if you look over the
record very
characteristically uh students have been
in the Forefront of the kinds of
political engagement that led to Serious
change was true of the Civil Rights
Movement the women's movement the
anti-war movement and goes way back and
there's a reason for that the reason is
that students are at a period of their
life when they have maximal freedom
they're sort
of mostly out of parental control
they're not yet in the circumstances
where they have to dedicate themselves
to putting food on the table they have
opportunities to think uh to interact
with one another uh to undertake actions
and many have done it and that can lead
to change as for sustainable businesses
yeah create them there's plenty of
things that can be done plenty of very
important things like worker managed uh
Enterprises uh Enterprises that are
dedicated to uh avoidance of
destructive forms of energy like fossil
fuels and uh develop uh sustainable
energy huge opportunities there and
there's case after
case thank
you hello Professor jsky um so in the
conversation about uh climate change we
hear a lot about the issues some of what
you spoke on tonight related to trade
and oil industry and transportation but
some one of the issues that I find is
omitted often in the conversation is the
unsustainable ways in which we produce
our food and the meat industry uh ac
across most developed countries and I'm
aware that the United Nations has I
think in the past year or two released
statements encouraging most societies to
move toward a vegan diet and vegetarian
so I'm wondering what your thoughts are
on this yeah industrial food production
is a major contribute contributor to CO2
emissions and uh not just meat
production for one thing but also uh
Foods in general with massive use of
pesticides and
fertilizers highly energy intensive and
uh this whole system really has to be
radically revised that's another serious
form of activism which can be done very
locally I mean the so-called localist
movement you know farmers markets local
production that's a step towards it but
it has to be done on a massive scale if
there's going to be survival the food
problems and the water problems are
massive thank
you hello thank you so much for speaking
with us um this evening
um I'm graduating um for with my
undergraduate degree um later on this
week and I have noticed within my peers
a severe lack of critical thinking and
I'm wondering if you have any advice to
give to the next generation of Scholars
um and what kind of advice you would
give them to
continue um to continue the fields that
you do work in what advice to
younger Scholars
and nothing but the simple
virtues you know be question dogma if
things
are are accepted without question if
they're generally accepted doctrines you
should immediately be suspicious and
nothing is that clear no and you should
have an open mind critical mind be
willing to challenge stay honest be
willing to face criticism and threats
and there can be threats don't want to
deny it an attempt to be
independent an independent thinker can
bring upon himself or herself uh
pretty serious threat it is a very free
country so you're not going to be sent
to a torture chamber but it might
undermine chances of getting the kind of
job you want okay those are the kinds of
things that you face in
life thank
you Hi how are
you I've been seeing more and more
reports even now in mainstream media
about the 28 redacted pages in The 9911
Commission report and many people are
now claiming that the information in
those pages implicates um Saudi official
involvement and possibly funding the
hijackers from for the attacks on
September 11th if those claims were ever
able to be verified and that information
was actually released to the American
public uh what effects do you think that
would have on us Saudi
relations um in the 28th Pages certainly
ought to be released right but I suspect
what they're probably going to reveal is
just the total incompetence of the
intelligence agencies in the political
leadership who had plenty of evidence
that something like this was likely to
happen but just didn't pay attention to
it because they were interested in
something else the chances that it will
implicate the government in 911 I think
are minuscule I mean if just think it
through if the Bush Administration had
been involved in any way and was in a
position to kind of shape the perception
of what happened what would they have
done they would have blamed
Iraqis they wouldn't have blamed
Saudis their main goal at the time was
to invade Iraq not Saudi Arabia that's
their Ally you have to protect them in
fact the fact that sis were implic ated
was a big
embarrassment the Bush Administration
had to break its own laws and fly its
Rich SOI friends out of the country when
they were supposed to be you know air
control uh they were TR they wanted
desperately to invade Iraq if they had
blamed the Iraqis they would have had
overwhelming support for the invasion
they wouldn't have had to invent stories
about uh weapons of mass destruction
which discredited them when they
exploded
even crazier stories about connections
between Saddam and Al-Qaeda they
wouldn't have had to resort to torture
most of which was uh directed by
Rumsfeld and Cheney to try to get some
piece of information that would link
Iraq to
9/11 they would and we know what the
effects quite apart from the moral and
other dimensions what the effects of the
exposures of torture were I mean unless
the totally saying they couldn't have
been involved so I don't think the 28
Pages which should be opened are going
to reveal that I suspect what they'll
reveal is the usual incompetence and
lack of concern for extremely serious uh
threats I mentioned a much more serious
one the lack of concern to try to block
uh icbms with nuclear war with hydrogen
bomb Warheads that's mindboggling
the one unfortunately no fortunately for
power nobody talks about it but that's
the kind of thing I would expect to be
exposed but it should be released we
should find out so there should be
pressure thank
you hi professor shumsky well my voice
is a bit gone uh I just came yesterday
24 hours ago from for the first time to
the USA I come from Argentina Spain and
I came from rikic it was a tricky
situation uh because rikic and Iceland
in this moment are going ongoing on a
very very complicated finan financial
situation a very crisis I am an educator
I teach languages I have been teaching
in Iceland how to teach the students of
younger students how to use their own
language because it's very difficult
and I was very every time I've been
traveling since the Panama papers happen
since I hold an Argentinian passport and
a Spanish
passport uh I've been very stressed to
be a minority so I have I've been
listening to all to to you I didn't know
you were going to be here so it was a
big surprise for me and I would like to
address two questions to you the first
one is in your opinion what and Nation
since everybody has been talking a lot
about na Nation defense nationality
defense uh the defense of the community
and
secondly I didn't catch what is the
question the the after that one what
that the question would be what do you
think it builds those uh components
those words Nation community and after
that question I asked myself would you
agree to the fact that educators but not
only well educated people in the legal
like in the legal system of the levels
are the best defense for a community to
avoid this uh secrecy and conspiracy
paranoid threats that we're constantly
advertising in the media it's a big on
the second question people who are
privileged and most well
educated people are privileged actually
academics are particularly privileged to
the extent that you have any privilege
you have
responsibility priv like if you're
spending 50 hours a week trying to put
food on the table there's a limited
number of things you can do if you're
privileged the way most of us are
there's a lot you can do so there's more
responsibility uh doesn't mean it's
going to be used well in fact quite
typically if you look at the record it's
used to support power but it doesn't
have to be that's a choice but if you're
educated yes if you're privileged in
other ways yes you have the
responsibility to do things I mean as
far as uh National groups and cultural
groups and so on they you know it's kind
of depends on what you make of them it
makes perfect sense for people to find
uh communities in which they're
comfortable in which they share values
in which they share ceremonies
traditions and so on all of that's very
healthy uh and healthy Society should
encourage it as long as it doesn't turn
into attacks on others that's the
difference if it's a matter of uh
cooperation with others it enriches the
society if it's a matter of trying to
crush others then it harms the society
but these are all our
choices thank you very
much hi
hi know um I just want to say first of
all thank you for your years of service
to people without power um to uh
knowledge and reason on behalf of people
without power for the most part um two
days ago the Obama Administration
awarded Henry Kissinger uh an award it
was conferred by Ashton Carter from over
here at the Kennedy School his friends
call him Ash um at the Pentagon the
award is distinguished public service
award it's the highest award that can be
given to a private citizen I guess by
the Pentagon I'd be interested to hear
you talk a little bit about your
assessment of Henry Kissinger and
in in particular I'm I'm I'm I'm
especially interested to ask because of
what I take to be an explicit
endorsement of voting for Hillary
Clinton if it should come to that given
the closeness um of of the clintons to
Henry Kissinger and the kind of the role
that that kind of politics in
international relations has played in in
the Clinton Administration and could be
expected to play in a future Clinton
administration again what's your take on
Henry Kissinger well Kissinger's made
some intelligent and useful comments uh
one of them was U can't remember the
exact words but he essentially tried to
Define what the responsibility of uh an
academic serious intellectual is and he
said it's their responsibility to uh
formulate accurately and appropriately
the interests and the wishes of the
people in power in other words you
should be a
Toady you should sit at the feet of the
powerful and try to help them achieve
what they're trying to achieve if you
look at his own record say in the
1960s he was desperately trying to uh
become the advisor to either side you
know Nixon Humphrey whoever would accept
him and put him in a position of
authority the carrying out this
responsibility and he had plenty of
initiative and it wasn't pretty uh we
can run through the cases you're
familiar with them most people are but
uh you can see why he would get an award
at the Kennedy School he was performing
the duty of a responsible
intellectual uh implementing the wishes
intentions and goals of the powerful in
an effective way what's wrong with that
that's the way you you know that's the
way you progress in the uh educational
institutions well the award was at the
Pentagon but um maybe there's not much
difference but um there's a difference P
tends to be more open usually but what
about what about what about the
relationship between um Clinton Clinton
and Kissinger I think Clinton if as I
recall is already on record is saying
that Kissinger is one of the admir her
admired Statesman so sure if it won't be
Kissinger it'll be somebody
comparable he happened to be pretty good
at it but there are others in the wings
thank you
um thank you Professor chomy for coming
out here tonight and um after hearing
like the brutal facts of the environment
and um the potential of nuclear fallout
I think a lot of people like myself and
lot of people in the crowd might feel
like a general like a like helplessness
or even hopelessness of like a possible
um of Escaping The Inevitable extinction
of the human species so I want to know
um how would you recommend overcoming
that sort of like maybe nihilism or
pessimism
well let's go back to
kinger he is one of u a few senior
respected Statesman George
Schultz uh NY couple of others who are
calling for elimination of nuclear
weapons for good reasons your reasons
and there is a legal
obligation legal obligation to pursue
for the nuclear states to pursue what
are called good faith measures to
eliminate nuclear
weapons that's it's in the
nonproliferation treaty article 6 and
it's also there's a world Court decision
1996 which basically uh repeated it as a
legal document so we're on pretty strong
ground if we call for the elimination of
nuclear weapons and
it can take it can go in stages like one
stage can be what say William Perry has
recently proposed elimination of
icbms one of the parts of the Triad and
a particularly dangerous part these are
almost useless and they're
guarded guarding the icbms is one of the
lowest level uh tasks that people in the
military can be assigned to so half the
time they're drunk or you know playing
poker or something like that which means
that they could just go off by accident
and they're doing almost nothing in
terms of defense they're kind of like a
power symbol so eliminating icbms would
be a pretty straightforward move uh
another straightforward move would be
and this is quite significant uh to try
to establish nuclear weapons free zones
in very parts of the
world that's a move towards first of all
has an educational effect of bringing
people to see look we can do something
but it also does reduce the threat of
conflict there are several there's one
in the Western Hemisphere but not
including everyone not including the
United States and Canada includes
everyone else uh there's one in the in
for Africa but not entirely because the
US insists on maintaining a major
nuclear base on the island of Diego
Garcia from which the population was
helpfully expelled by the British so the
us could build it up and Obama's built
it up even further also can't quite uh
implement it in Africa there's one for
the Pacific but again there's a problem
at first it was blocked by France which
was carrying out nuclear tests there
they stopped but now the US insists that
the Pacific Islands that the US controls
be used both for storage of nuclear
weapons and passes passage of nuclear
submarines and so on so that one can't
be implemented uh the most important one
uh is the is a Middle East uh a Middle
East nuclear weapons free zone that's
extremely important for one thing the
future of the nonpol eration treaty
depends on it this is not widely
advertised but if you take a look at say
Arms Control journals the
nonproliferation treaty is the most
important military treaty we've ever had
it's restricted hasn't limited but it's
restricted the spread of nuclear weapons
uh that treaty is contingent on steps to
take to establish a nuclear weapons free
zone in the Middle East the that has
been the initiative comes from the
Middle East States the Arab states and
Iran have pressed very hard for a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East recently it's mainly Iran uh Iran
was the head of the non-line movement
and which strongly supports this and U
in that position has dramatically and
repeatedly called for moving to
establish a nuclear weapons free zone in
the region
but if you look back at the
negotiations literally the future of the
nonproliferation treaty is contingent on
doing that why has the whole world
practically The Whole World's in favor
of it can't go through you know why
because people like us aren't doing
anything about it Obama's blocked it
repeatedly just as his predecessors did
they don't want it and the pretext is
well first we have to have a general
peace settlement then we can do it that
means let's never do it uh and the
reason which everyone understands is we
have to protect Israeli nuclear forces
from
inspection and that's a very high uh
necessity so therefore we have to
sacrifice uh the possibility we have to
accept the possibility that the whole
nuclear peripher system May collapse
because it's so important to ensure that
Israel dominates the region with nuclear
weapons client State well those are
things that are going on in the world we
don't have to accept
them all right thank you very much no
can we take say 25 question yeah just
one more one more yeah uh we're sorry uh
chsky will have to leave soon so I know
you have been waiting for a long time
but just one more question sorry hello
Mr trky thank you
for hello Mr trky thank thank you for
all your work throughout your lifetime
um my mom who's an elementary school
teacher is going back to school after
many years to study Linguistics and I
being a high school teacher I mean I
being a high school student uh read a
lot of your political work um I took
your recommendation uh to read uh
anarchism by Daniel Garen by Daniel
Garen yeah um but to contrast I read uh
capitalism and Freedom by Milton
Friedman um and there were actually some
similarities um in the first chapter uh
Milton fredman says that U he advocates
for absolute freedom and that uh
reminded me of individual individualist
anarchists like Max sterer uh and he
also said that uh um there that um
companies ought to be voluntary work
ought to be voluntary and ought to be
cooperative uh which reminded me of like
anarch anaros syndic ISM um and the uh
free market sort of remind me of uh what
Anarchist called federalism um so in
brief what really sets anarchism apart
and makes it so virtuous in your opinion
and what makes free market capitalism so
vicious well there is um a brand of
what's called anarchism in the United
States and to an extent in England which
is a very sharp departure from the whole
libertarian tradition it's called anarco
CAP capitalism that's what's called
libertarian here if you take a look at
it it's advocacy of the most extreme
form of autocracy and oppression that
has ever existed uh what it support the
policies whatever the proponents May
believe the policies very quickly turn
into concentration of power in the hands
of unaccountable private institutions
the worst kind of
autocracy political states are at least
partially accountable private
concentrations of power aren't the idea
that you have voluntary
agreements that goes back to a famous
comment of anat France that under
conditions of perfect Freedom both the
poor man and the rich man have equal
rights to sleep under the bridge yeah
that's what voluntary agreement is if
you're uh if you have no means of
support and somebody who has all the
power is willing to give you a couple of
pennies you can make a voluntary
agreement saying okay I won't starve
I'll be your slave voluntary agreement
and in fact some of the more honest
Advocates of this position like James
beanan uh Nobel Prize Laureate uh argued
at one point point that every human
being's highest aspiration is to ensure
that everyone else in the world is his
slave that's the kind of people we are
that's our nature we want to make sure
that everyone is enslaved to us and
these policies basically
are are based on that conception of
human nature another well-known Advocate
Mari rothbart is strongly opposed to
laws that require children to parents to
feed their children why should parents
be forced by the state to feed their
children uh that's the con and if you
accept their conception of Liberty
that's true why should you be uh it's
it's radically different from the
libertarian tradition and it's pretty
striking to see how different it is so
if you go back to back to say Adam Smith
yeah who's supposed to be a advocate of
Classical liberalism take a look at his
actual views uh everyone's heard the
phrase invisible hand uh very few people
have bothered to look at how Adam Smith
used the phrase actually he used it
twice once in Wealth of Nations once in
his His companion book moral sentiments
in moral sentiments here's the way he
uses it he says suppose it's an
Agricultural Society he's talking about
he says suppose some land owner
accumulated almost all the land and
everybody else had to depend on him for
survival he says well this wouldn't
really matter very much because because
of the natural sympathy of the landowner
for other people which is kind of the
core of human nature he would make sure
that the goods of the his possessions
are distributed fairly equally so it
would end up with a fairly egalitarian
society as if by an invisible hand
that's Adam Smith is not what you
learned in school actually the other
place he uses it in Wealth of Nations if
you take a look it's pretty much an
argument against what's nowadays called
neoliberal
globalization what he says is uh he says
suppose that in England what he's
concerned with the uh manufacturers and
uh Merchants sold their goods abroad
manufactured abroad and imported from
abroad they' make money but the people
of England will would suffer however he
says probably not going to happen
because they're going to have enough
concern for their own society that
they'll be willing to sacrifice profit
for the general good so as if by an
invisible hand we'll be saved from the
ravages of what's now called
globalization that's Adam Smith it's
based on a different conception of human
nature it assumes that the basic
Enlightenment conception that the core
of human nature is sympathy concern for
others Mutual support and so on not hate
everyone else get as much as you can for
yourself make everyone else your slave
and we'll call that
freedom yeah well I'm I'm reading uh
Anne Ran's book a virtue of selfishness
I'm reading an Ran's book virtue of
selfishness too so that's a caricature
