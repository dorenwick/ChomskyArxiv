[Yanis] Good evening, good day,
good morning, good afternoon,
wherever you might happen 
to be.
I'm Yanis Varoufakis
on behalf of DiEM25.
I have the honor, the privilege
and the extreme joy
of being joined by two usual suspects,
two great friends and comrades of DiEM25,
and, I'm glad to say,
of myself personally.
Ann Pettifor,
Ann I believe you are in London
- yeah
Correct, correct.
Ann is of course a usual suspect.
She's been involved in struggles
to make sense of economics against
the edicts of the economics profession,
struggles against the financial sector.
She has tried to help the Labour Party
when the Labour Party
was in the hands of people
who wanted to confront
the Establishment.
We've done quite a few things together.
Noam Chomsky does not
need an introduction.
The only part of his
illustrious CV that I'm going to mention
is that he is a member
of the Advisory Board of DiEM25.
This is a very self-serving mention,
Noam.
I haven't seen either Ann
or Noam for a while.
This Covid-19 situation has been appalling
for the human condition.
Today we have this opportunity
to see each other,
even if it's only in two dimensions,
through the medium of the Internet.
We're getting together to discuss
the appalling fiasco,
the lost opportunity
- well, it was never
a real opportunity, I don't think -
the fraud that was COP 26,
an occasion
that was advertised by the powers that be
as a great chance humanity had,
maybe the last chance humanity had,
to prevent itself from going
past the point of no return
regarding climate catastrophe.
Without further ado,
let me begin with Noam.
Noam, what do you make of it?
What do you make of COP 26?
[Noam] Well, it's unfortunate,
but predictable and predicted.
We could run through
the content very quickly
since there basically wasn't any.
A number of nice words.
Promises, we'll meet next year
and see if we can do anything,
but, essentially,
that's the content.
Which is what was anticipated.
And it teaches us,
it reinforces a lesson
that we already knew.
The only way anything is going to change,
the only chance for humanity,
to borrow their phrase,
is for massive, organized,
popular action and opposition.
The important part of COP26
was what was happening in the streets.
That's the hope for humanity.
And unless many more people
become involved and more deeply engaged,
that hope may vanish.
There's a -
I almost hate to quote it:
but one of my favorite
statements in the Confucian Analects
is a definition of the exemplary person,
presumably the master himself.
The exemplary person is the person
who keeps on struggling,
even though he knows there is no hope.
Well, I don't think we've reached
the level of being exemplary people,
yet, there is hope,
but it's diminishing.
So we're short of being exemplary
for the time being, but getting close.
And there are developments
taking place in the world
which are even more ominous
than the predictable collapse of COP26.
The most powerful state in world history
is going to have an inordinate effect
on whether there's a way
out of this crisis,
and it is moving into the hands
of a radical denialist party.
We've had four years of racing towards
the abyss as quickly as possible,
a brief escape from it,
very likely coming back soon,
and it's coming back in a way
which may be virtually permanent
because of the radical efforts
on the part of the far right
- that's the Republican organization-
to undermine the prospects
for elections in the United States.
They 're working hard on it.
They may succeed.
Well, that's a special burden
on the United States,
but on the rest of the world too.
If Europe continues its craven
subordination to U.S. power,
there will be no counter force to this,
and Europe doesn't have to do it.
Europe has the resources, the capacity,
to move in an independent way,
instead of subordinating itself
consistently to the master of the world,
and if it doesn't take that role, it will
accelerate the process of decline.
These are all matters that we...
it's one of the reasons why the Corbyn
movement was so important in England.
It gave a chance for the Labour Party
to become a true popular party
that would be dedicated to
the needs of the working people
and the general population of England.
I don't have to tell you, but,
as you know better than I do,
that led to a huge campaign
on the part of the whole Establishment,
including, what's called the Left,
to try to squash this heresy
before it took place
and to return the Labour Party
to essentially Blairite neo-Thatcherism.
It's a catastrophe for England
and for the world.
But these are things that have to be
overcome wherever they take place.
As far as the failure
of COP26 is concerned,
it was a success on the streets and
it reinforced what we already knew.
That's where the hope lies.
It's mostly young people,
which is a severe condemnation of
my generation, your generation,
of just beyond belief
that we're imposing this burden
on the young people of the world
who are taking up,
picking up the gauntlet.
They need every possible
assistance they can get,
because what they're doing on the streets
of Glasgow is the hope of the future.
[Yanis] Ann, I don't know about you,
but I'd try to navigate the conundrum
that Noam has just put forward
by distinguishing between
hope and optimism.
I choose to be pessimistic while not
losing my grasp on hope, how about you?
[Ann] Well, I'd like to start
where Noam ended,
with the young people on the streets
of Glasgow because they are hope.
I wasn't there, but everyone
who was there tells me
that they understand that
this is a need for system change
in a way that our generation
didn't understand.
And they're clear about that
and I think from all the evidence we see
that that is the case.
So I am not entirely without hope,
although I'm angry,
I'm very angry at the outcome of this.
I'm also angry at the way in which
we've allowed ourselves
to follow the agenda set
by global capital, if you like,
which is to set some unattainable target
and just to have target-based
discussions and debates
around a target
which is just a number out there,
without discussing changes
to systems and policies.
And that's exactly where
they want us to be.
They want us to be in that box of saying:
"Are we going to hit this number
or not hit the number?"
They don't want us in the box of
transformation of the system
and change to policies.
Indeed, policies weren't even discussed,
as far as I can tell, at this event.
So I, like Noam,
I despair,
because we know what is happening
to global temperatures.
We know that the physics doesn't respond
to this kind of empty blah, blah, blah
but responds to real change,
and we haven't seen that real change.
But I I'm also heartened
by looking at history
and understanding that
there have been periods in history
when global economic systems
have undergone great transformations
and they've undergone
those transformations almost overnight.
This last year, we've celebrated
the 50th anniversary of the "Nixon Shock".
Now the Nixon Shock is a story
that has remained secret, if you like,
for a very long time.
Economists pride themselves
on ignoring that moment in history.
It's taken a historian this year,
a Republican historian, Garten,
to write the story of how Nixon
met with Paul Volker and others
over a weekend in 1971
and plotted the downfall of
an international system
of financial architecture, i.e
the Bretton Woods system
and announced on a Sunday night,
just after a big cowboy show
that was very popular with Americans,
to the world and without consulting
his partners, his allies,
or indeed the IMF,
the World Bank,
or any other institution,
or, indeed, well,
the Federal Reserve was involved in this,
but anyway, overnight,
announced the dismantling
of the global financial architecture,
just like that.
Boom! Bang! Bash, right?
And there was no alternative offered.
And then alternative, of course,
was the United States Dollar
- not just the United States Dollar,
but the United States' debt -
as the world's reserve currency.
That's what emerged,
ultimately.
But at the point I want to make
is that the right does not hesitate
transformation when it wants to
and has achieved
such a transformation.
Now, that was one that was regressive,
but in 1933, equally,
when Roosevelt came to power
on the night of his inauguration,
- as the historian Eric Rauchway
has documented -
on the night of his inauguration,
he decided he was going to dismantle
the global financial system of the day,
which was the gold standard.
And he said to his staff:
"We're going to close the banks
and we're going to take the gold
out of Wall Street
and put it in the Treasury
and we will in future determine
the value of the currency.
We won't leave that to Wall Street.
And his staff said:
"You can't do it tonight or tomorrow
because tomorrow is a holy day, Sunday.
You'll have to wait to close the banks
on Monday.
And when he closed the banks,
the story the economists tell
is that he just closed the banks
in order to save the banks.
But he didn't!
He closed the banks in order to
take the gold out of their vaults
and take from them the power
to manage key levers of the economy,
the exchange rate,
the interest rate,
the the flow of capital across borders,
and that transformation
also took place overnight.
And because the United States was
in a state of profound depression,
Wall Street was slow to react.
They did react ultimately,
but, initially,
they were just taken aback.
So I'm trying what I'm trying to argue
is that we have to take hope
from the fact
that we have in the past
transformed the global economy.
It is not impossible.
We need political will
and we need leadership.
We need intellectual thought leadership
as well as political leadership.
I want us to think about it.
And, above all,
and can I just end on this note?
The Green New Deal
has been attacked recently
in favor away from the Green New Deal
and towards something called localization.
Now, localization is actually
a really important feature
of the Green New Deal,
but what was absolutely key
about the Green New Deal
was that we understood that in
order to save and transform the ecosystem,
we had to change the international
financial and economic system.
And until the left focuses on
the international financial system
and the fact that it acts as master
of the global economy.
And until we learn
to do something about that,
it's not going to be possible,
in my view,
to fight to save the ecosystem.
So I want us to understand
the interconnectedness of these things,
how sort of highly complex
they are at the moment,
but how closely integrated
they are,
and we have to deal with the system.
We have to have system change
before we can save the climate.
I'll stop at that point.
[Yanis] Hear hear on the last sentence!
Unless we have system change...
if I may put in my reaction
to what you said, Ann.
Look, the two examples
that you gave,
1933 Roosevelt's shutting down
of the banks,
the night the money stopped,
as at that day or night was remembered,
and the 15th of August 1971,
the end of Bretton Woods.
They were momentous events.
They were very radical breaks
from the previous phases of capitalism.
But,
at the same time,
Roosevelt's move was a progressive move.
Nixon's move was an inevitable move.
He could not have sustained
the Bretton Wood system,
which was built and predicated upon
America being a surplus country.
By 1967-68,
it wasn't a surplus country,
it would have to go.
And the Americans,
unlike the Germans or the Europeans,
are very good at destroying
a system they created
when it's past its due date.
But in both cases
this was top-down change,
fundamental change.
Sometimes,
as we used to say,
once upon a time
we radicals,
those in control of the system,
those who are governing the system
in order to make sure
that nothing changes
will change everything.
Everything must change
so that nothing changes.
So, in both cases occasions:
Roosevelt was not a leftie.
He was just a very smart patrician
who understood that he had to change
the system completely
if he was going to keep capitalism.
And, similarly,
Nixon in 1971.
I believe LBJ would have done it
if he'd hung around.
They realized that in order to keep
American hegemony going
now that they were a deficit country,
they had to pump up the volume
in terms of debt
and turning debt into what backs up
the the global currency,
the exorbitant privilege
of the US dollar.
But in both of those occasions
you had the system
which is now destroying the planet,
reacting violently against Itself,
in order to preserve itself.
What we now need is
a similarly monumental change,
which is going to
go against the system,
not in the interest of the system.
And I don't think those two examples
of 1971 and 1933 are good examples.
More generally:
allow me just to say a few things,
because I want you to react,
both you Noam and you Ann,
to react to an analysis of mine.
The climate catastrophe we're facing
is the result of three issues,
three processes.
One, is the standard Free-rider problem.
You know, let the others
do the costly things
that need to be done to save the planet
and let them do it.
If they manage to do it,
then I'm scot-free,
I will survive as well.
If they don't do it -
What am I?
The sucker who's going to
do it for them!?
This is a free ride.
The problem is typical
of all collective action problems.
There is a second problem,
which is a major coordination failure.
Mark Carney went to Glasgow
representing a big financial syndicate,
saying: "I have 130 trillion
dollars with me,
the money is here,
the world must decide
whether to use it!"
It is completely true
that the money is there.
The world financial circuits
have never been more replete with money.
The money exists,
but there is no way of coordinating
the money which is there,
the technologies
which are necessary,
and the wants of the people,
the needs of humanity
and the planet.
This is a coordination.
And, then, thirdly,
there is capitalism,
because capitalism is a process
which began, as we all know,
three centuries ago.
It's a process of commodifying everything,
privatizing the commons,
and eating up anything
which has no price but value,
and converting that into a price
and to private profit.
So once they've started
eating up the commons
and the only impediment
to the degree of exploitation
of humanity and of nature
was the cost
- the private cost,
not the social cost.
And this capitalist beast
is going to continue.
You talked about the target
that they set, the number in Glasgow,
net zero by 2000 and something,
right?
I mean the whole point of net zero
is to make sure that they will
continue to exploit fossil fuels
as long as the private cost to them
is much much lower than the social cost.
In other words,
they will continue
to destroy the planet.
There will be very clear numbers
when it comes to how much destruction
they will wreak,
and then offset it somehow,
some time, somewhere,
by means of mechanisms
that we have no way of measuring.
And the Green New Deal
is an absolutely necessary stepping stone
towards saving the planet
because it helps us overcome
the Free-riding problem
and the coordination problem.
Taking the money,
- like Roosevelt did in 1933 -
taking the extra cash
which was available,
the idle savings of the rich,
and pressing them into the service
of common works
and the New Deal
in the 1930s.
We can do this with Green Works.
So the Free-rider problem
and the coordination problem
can be solved by means
of the Green New Deal
if we can impose it
upon the powers that be.
But that doesn't do away
with the problem of capitalism.
For that we need to reconsider
the system, as you said, Ann.
We have to reconsider property rights,
who owns stuff,
who owns the processes?
Anyway.
I've spoken enough!
Noam.
[Noam] Well, what you're talking about
is the evolution of capitalism
from, back to the enclosure movement
in England,
which took away the commons
from the population
and commodified it
and turned the independent farmers
into what was called wage slaves.
People fought against it bitterly
in the United States, right through
the 19th century.
Radical farmers, workers bitterly opposed
the efforts to turn them
to take away their rights as free,
independent citizens and to force them
to subject themselves to masters.
The goal of the rising Warburg Movement
in the 19th century was to establish
a system of cooperation in which workers
would own and manage their enterprises
in coordination with one another.
The farmers movement - it was mostly
an agricultural country then -
sought to develop a what they called
a cooperative commonwealth
in which farmers would be free from
the rule of northeastern bankers
and market managers.
They would set up their own banks.
They would (set up) their own
cooperative management systems.
They came very close to integrating
with each other, the Knights of Labor
and the radical populace.
If that had happened,
it would have been
a very different country
and a very different world.
So the question is:
can it now happen again?
Well, that's what we have to
try to achieve.
Now, there are some objective facts
that we can't overlook:
questions of time scale.
The urgency of the climate crisis
is such that it must be dealt with
within, basically the framework
of existing institutions.
That doesn't mean you stop trying to
change the institutions
and lead to the system change
that you've both eloquently described.
There are parallel acts in parallel,
but the fact of the matter is that
the concrete measures will have to
be done by actions within
the framework of institutions that exist,
but compelling them
to behave differently, while at the
same time seeking to change them.
That 130 trillion dollars can be used
for the common good
if enough pressure is imposed
to force those who illegitimately own it
to use it in that way,
in what they describe as,
"the peasants coming with the pitchforks"
We have to make sure there are
more peasants and sharper pitchforks.
It's succeeded enough so far
for them to be beginning
to be concerned about what
they call 'reputational risks'.
We saw that at Davos, for example.
We've got to be worried about
the reputational risks
The peasants may come
and take it all away from us,
because our ownership of this
is very fragile and if the peasants
rise up and come to understand that,
it'll all disappear.
It's in their hands if, they
understand enough to take it.
So we therefore better present
ourselves as what used to be called
"soulful corporations".
Corporations that are working with
the management,
working day and night slaving away
for the common good,
because we are so dedicated
to the welfare of humanity.
We are soulful corporations.
This is from the 1950s, 
but it's being revived.
Well, it's necessary for the peasants
with the pitchforks to understand
what's happening, to know that
the pressures have to be mounted.
There's no soulful corporations.
There are institutions dedicated
to short-term profit for the wealthy
and for the managerial sector,
but you can compel them to do things,
while at the same time, trying to
spread the understanding that
their ownership is illegitimate.
It's not their wealth.
It's ours, the your wealth.
the wealth of the population.
We should reconstruct society
to take it from them,
take it back, and use it for the purposes
of creating the kind of cooperative
commonwealth that workers and farmers
were committed to for centuries.
That can be done, while at the same time,
we have to carry out urgent measures
by pressures on the illegitimate owners
to spend their illegitimate wealth
in ways which will overcome
immediate crises.
And I think, those are difficult tasks,
but not impossible ones,
and they have to be carried out
energetically and simultaneously.
We can't put off the urgent measures
until we've come to create
a more free and just society,
work on that, but meanwhile,
pursue the urgent measures
and in fact there are feasible ways,
important to recognize.
There are feasible proposers within
a small percentage of GDP
- a couple of percent of GDP -
to carry out measures which,
in the short term,
will overcome the urgent crises
and at least allow us
time to move towards
the more far-reaching and fundamental
questions of significant system change.
That's the task that's in front of us.
[Ann] Thank you.
[Yanis] Ann, can I ask you to,
because you spoke about
system change as well, so did I
and of course, Norm just gave us
a great insight into the importance,
how crucial system change is.
For our audience, can you just
share with us your vision
of ownership, of corporations, of energy,
of energy grids, I should say.
How do you imagine
a radically different system?
[Ann] So I didn't mention 1971,
without understanding that what Nixon
was doing was consolidating capitalism.
I mentioned 1971 and 1933 which,
as you rightly argue, Yanis
were both attempts at consolidating
capitalism, simply because
I wanted to show that actually,
these big international global systems,
these meta-economic conditions
that safeguard capitalism
on the scale of the entire world,
that those conditions
can change overnight, right?
Now, the question those, on
those two occasions,
they were for consolidation, right?
But they were also transformational.
My problem is that I don't think that
the Left, in the broader sense of
the world, progressives,
are ready for
what to put in place when
the next crisis comes and I think
it could be as sudden and as,
[Yanis] Well.
that's why I'm asking
for your vision.
[Ann] Well, my vision is the
Green New Deal,
that we subordinate the globalized
financial system, to the interests of
local communities and national
communities where
democratic accountability is possible.
My vision is for
on-shore-ing mobile capital, basically.
My vision is for managing
flows of capital between countries.
My vision is for restoring democratic
accountability to the financial system,
to the economic system,
and in order for that to happen,
we have to abolish capitalism.
There's no doubt in my mind,
because capitalism relies
at the moment on those
meta-economic conditions.
It relies for its expansiveness
on the fact that it's detached
from regulatory democracy.
I'm bringing it down to earth.
Sorry?
[Yanis] So who owns Facebook
in your schema?
[Noam] For me?
[Yanis] Let Ann answer first
and then Noam.
[Yanis] Who owns it
Who should own it?
[Ann] I think the public
should own it.
I think this is a public utility.
Facebook is a public utility,
of course.
There are utilities
that should be publicly owned.
I'm very clear about that
Water, electricity, energy - these are
all important to the survival of humanity
and to the stability of social systems,
so I I'm very clear about that.
But I'm also clear that we will have
some private sector activity,
we will have markets,
we've had markets for more than
5000 years of human society,
so we will have markets,
but markets will not govern societies.
Societies will govern markets
and societies will make what is joint,
what is collaborative,
what is communal, communal,
and that's what will happen,
but it cannot happen until
we begin to on-shore capital,
until we begin to subordinate
our, now detached, financial system
to the interests of local
and national communities.
And the thing I despair of is that
the Left will not look at and study
the 400 trillion dollar system
that is the shadow banking system.
It's no accident,
because the shadow banking system
has been designed to be in the shadows.
It has been designed
to be invisible to us,
but that we shouldn't fall for that,
we should be challenging it.
Instead, we are myopically
preoccupied, in my view,
and I'm being a bit exaggerated here,
with what's happening here,
locally, at our feet.
Now, we've got to be caring about that,
and we've got to be accountable for that,
but we also have to look at the international
system, in the way that Rosa Luxembourg...
Rosa luxembourg was about
the Internationale,
a sort of central theme of socialism
the time of Rosa Luxembourg,
but it isn't anymore.
We don't talk about it in that sense,
so I want us to understand that.
That's my vision.
My vision is:
bring global capital back, onshore
and allow monetary systems,
which are social systems
systems constructed by society for
the purpose of facilitating transactions
which enable us to do what we can do.
That's a social construct,
one that we should be in charge of
and that shouldn't be detached
from regulatory democracy.
I feel I'm ranting and raving now,
so you better stop me Yanis!
[Yanis] That's what we're here for
tonight!
Noam, who should own Facebook?
The electricity grid across Europe,
let's say, or the North Americas,
and the local cafeteria?
The electricity
grid and the local cafeteria.
[Noam] Well, I think
that's the place to start.
First of all, I'm not so convinced that 
anything improves much,
if it becomes national.
I think the idea that workers of the world
should unite has a serious point to it.
There are good reasons for working people
around the world to unite
in taking back the international commons,
which is not local, it's international.
So, I would like to see international...
You know, a lot of unions have the word
international in their name.
I think it would be a good thing if that
became operative the way it once was.
There has to be an international
movement of solidarity
with people who want to take their lives
over and run it themselves.
So, yes, let's take the notion
of public ownership of utilities.
I think that makes sense,
but then the question is:
who is the public and how do they own it,
and what do they do about it?
Well, here I think we have to go back 
to the fundamental evil
of the capitalist system.
The idea that you have
to subject yourself to a master
for most of your waking life.
It's considered, it's called 
taking, having a job.
Having a job means
you subordinate yourself
to arbitrary control of a totally
unaccountable master
for most of your waking life,
who has the kind of controls
that Stalin never dreamed of.
Stalin couldn't tell you you're allowed to
go to the bathroom at 3 pm for 5 minutes,
and here are the clothes you have to wear
and here are the steps you take,
if you want to move from here to here
and, also in your private life, you're
not allowed to do this and that.
This, for thousands of years
back to Classical times,
this was regarded as a fundamental attack
on human rights and human decency.
Qualification: It was okay for slaves,
they could do it,
but not for free people
or more precisely free men.
Free men had to be free
from this indignity.
Well, we now extend it.
It's not free men,
it's free people not free,
while the slaves do the work,
but no slaves.
It's the general population
who take over from the beginning,
from the spot, where
they're spending their lives,
control over their lives,
control over their workplaces,
not subordinating themselves
to a master,
moving in association with others
towards the kind of cooperative
commonwealth based on popular, 
informed participation at every level,
eliminating the whole concept
of masters and subordinates,
unless, representatives
can be chosen under popular control,
but there should be no form
of authority other than that.
I think that's the kind
of system change we need.
It will, it must be international 
because they're international -
none of the crises we face have borders -
there's no borders to heating the climate,
to pandemics, to nuclear war.
We either work on all of this together
or we're all doomed,
and I think the point of departure is
from breaking this idea,
that you should be subordinated
to a master during your waking lives.
That's a 20th century idea,
that was beaten into people's heads
with major efforts and struggle,
and we have to free ourselves from it.
If we do that, the rest of the system
begins to collapse.
I think we can work on that
at every level,
including the levels that
Ann has been talking about,
at every level, at the level of increasing
the so-called reputational risk
to compel those who illegitimately own
capital to use it in the common interest.
At the same time, dismantling, 
laying the basis for dismantling,
their illegitimate ownership and,
at the same time,
carrying out the urgent measures,
which can be implemented now,
feasibly, to at least, give us
some space to survive.
If we don't do that in another
couple of decades, it'll all be over.
All of this will be academic.
[Ann] Yanis, I want to just add
to what Noam said there,
and to give credit to my colleague,
Geoff Tily,
who's the senior economist
at the TUC here.
He argues, correctly I think, that what we
have now is the globalization of wealth,
a form of internationalism
that benefits the 1%
and, as Noam has argued, what we want is
an inter-nationalism of labor
in the sense of the 99%.
That's what we need.
We need to transform our global system
of globalization,
which serves only the interests
of the master, the 1%,
into a form of inter-nationalism
that serves the interests of labour.
So I think Noam was
absolutely right on that.
[Yanis] If you allow me, I would like
to add a note of optimism,
which is very rare for me,
to try to do these days.
Because, listening
to you, both of you now...
This internationalization of labour
is not without precedent
and it is recent,
the precedent I'm referring to.
If you think of the first, the original
Internet, if you think of Linux,
open source software
which is now taking over,
I mean even Jeff Bezos's
machines run on Linux.
Linux is the result of
internationalized, massive,
technologically sophisticated
supreme software,
produced by people who worked,
without bosses
without trying to maximize 
their profits from their wares,
from their intellectual labour.
They collaborated across the ether,
across the world, they keep doing it
and they are putting together this
magnificent, technological infrastructure.
Because, what I want us to avoid is
for our audience to think that,
if we're going to have a cooperative,
it must be rural.
It must be, you know, avocados and
potatoes that we grow together
and we go back to
a kind of rural idiocy.
No, it is happening already
at the most advanced level of technology.
The problem is that all this 
internationalized,
anarcho-syndicalist technology
is then used by Bezos
to appropriate our data
and to build on top of these commons,
this technological,
labour-intensive commons,
to build his own empire.
The only way of stopping that from
happening is by clashing mercilessly
with the interests that own, these
not technologies, but the property rights
over our identities, over our humanity,
because this is what they do.
There's nothing else that they have.
They have property rights over us.
This is very illiberal as well.
It's not just capitalism, 
it's feudal, actually!
I don't think that we even
live in capitalism anymore.
I call it techno-feudalism.
So, it is crucial to let people know
out there, that the commons
are already happening, except that they
are again, being privatized by leeches
and we have to be ready to call them
out and to clash with them,
so that we can energize and
we can press into the service of humanity
the new commons that are being created
by young people and not so young people,
who simply do not want to play
the capitalist game anymore.
[Ann] So the only way to do that, Yanis,
is to manage capital mobility - 
trans-border capital flows -
[Yanis] Property rights as well!
[Ann] The fact of the matter is, if we 
wanted to build a new system at home,
we cannot, for example,
raise the tax revenues to do that,
because Mr Bezos and Amazon
and Google and Facebook
are all shifting their profits out of our
domain and in some tax haven or wherever
and their ability to move their capital
across borders is their great power.
And we have conceded that power.
[Yanis] Sure, that is one thing
we need to do.
Capital controls is one thing
we need to do.
[Ann] I don't like to call them controls,
I like to call them, 
managing capital flows.
[Yanis] To manage it, you need controls.
Let's not beat about the bush
but it's also the question
of property rights.
[Ann] they're associated with that power.
[Yanis] Of course, the two go together.
Redistributing property rights
and inroducing capital management.
Noam, you want to come in.
[Noam] Well, property rights
are not graven in stone.
They were imposed by organized capital
when they instituted the Uruguay round
of the WTO arrangements,
which were designed to radically violate
any meaningful form of free trade
by introducing extraordinary property
rights, TRIPS, patent rights of a kind
which had never existed in history.
If they had existed, England
would never have developed,
because it was taking higher technology
from India and the Low Countries,
even from Ireland.
The United States would certainly
never have developed,
since it was taking
superior British technology.
The United States would still be
exporting, you know, fur and cotton.
These were imposed in the
neoliberal globalization programs.
As Ann said, no consultation with anyone.
This is just the organized
international capital saying
here's the way we can rob people
for the long term
by imposing the kinds of
extensive property rights
which guarantee monopoly
pricing opportunities, indefinitely.
So there's no legitimacy to that,
it can be torn down very quickly,
the way labour tried to break it up
at the beginning.
We should remember
there have been struggles about this.
When Clinton tried to impose NAFTA,
he had to do it in secret.
He never informed the labour movement,
contrary to American law.
He informed them just at the last minute,
and the reason was they had
alternative programs
for integration of
the North American countries,
which would lead to high-growth high-wage
economies, and the owners didn't want that
and since they also owned the government,
the government was able to ram through,
over popular opposition,
a low-wage low-growth form of NAFTA
which has, in North America,
led to what we've seen since, is
internationalized in the Uruguay round.
But that's just a power play,
with better organization, more activism,
and, in fact, international cooperation,
the labour movements of the countries
could have created a very different form
of international economic integration
in their interest.
Just as if you go back to the turn
of the century, late 19th century,
radical farmers and workers could have
created a cooperative commonwealth.
A kind of radical democracy in the US
would not be subjected to the rule of
actually a fraction of 1%.
If we look at the details,
it didn't happen by laws of nature,
just by use of private power and
you could see it coming.
You could see it when Margaret Thatcher
said "there's no society",
either she's very stupid or she was lying
and I don't think she was stupid.
She knew perfectly well that
there's plenty of society,
rich society, at the upper top levels.
There are all sorts of
integrations of capital,
business roundtables, 
chambers of commerce,
international business 
trade associations,
all work very closely internationally
to ensure their own benefit.
So there's a rich society
for the very wealthy and the owners,
the illegitimate owners of capital,
but no society for the general population
and that's basically neoliberalism,
in a nutshell.
Marx described it.
Thatcher was
paraphrasing him, probably unwittingly,
when he condemned the autocratic
governments of the 19th century
for wanting to turn people
into a sack of potatoes.
Isolated, atomized individuals
who cannot fight back against the attempt
to turn them into virtual slaves.
That's, basically, neoliberalism.
A form of class war, which is quite old.
It takes new forms and at every point, 
including property rights,
as you mentioned, a crucial point,
the struggle can go on to take this away.
There's no reason why Bill Gates should
be a multi-millionaire,
because he has monopoly
pricing rights over Windows,
or that Big Pharma should be able
to charge 10 times the price of a drug
because they have property rights
granted to them
or why Apple corporation
can become very rich by rent,
by using its property rights
while somebody else does the work.
These are not laws of nature.
These are structures designed
and imposed by the very wealthy,
the corporate sector
for their own interests,
and that has to be dismantled
from top to bottom.
[Ann] I'm so glad that Noam has raised...
[Yanis] Hold up, hold on,
because we are entering
the last 10 minutes
and you will share it with us,
because we're entering
the last 10 minutes,
I have a duty, as the "moderator"
to put to you at least one question
that's coming from our audience:
So here is one,
and maybe you can blend
what you just wanted to say
and with your answer
to this question.
"Humanity has been struggling
now for a couple of years
to adapt itself to the new
circumstances of the pandemic.
How has this collective struggle changed
your expectation
on our capacities (as a) species
to respond to climate change?"
So, say what you want to say, Ann,
and address that question as well:
[Ann] I'm going to drop Bill Gates
because Noam dealt with him.
No, no, I think the pandemic
was extraordinary
and it showed how capitalism
had to be nationalized to survive
the invasion of a small virus,
basically.
So, capitalism was nationalized.
Wall Street was nationalized.
Wall street collapsed in March 2020
and had to be bailed out
by the Federal Reserve, right?
And the same applied
to financial sectors everywhere.
So, what the pandemic showed us
is that the state
- and this is the point
I really would like to make here -
is that the state,
what Noam's referred to
as property rights,
the power that we give to
Bill Gates to earn money effortlessly
without any real innovation
or technological advance,
but simply because he has property rights
over something,
that power is given by the State.
And the State, in turn,
- and Noam was quite right
to say
that it's owned by capital
right now -
but actually the state depends
almost entirely on the tax revenues
of us individual taxpayers,
of the citizens, basically,
and the citizens must, once again,
re-claim the State
- as it is our own, really -
and not, for example, empower the State
to dispense these property rights.
So I think what the pandemic
showed us
is that the state is quite capable
of doing that.
We were quite capable of nationalizing
Wall Street,
but then we allowed them to take all
of those gains
from all of that quantitative easing
and use it for
- God knows what they're squandering
it on at the moment! -
at the moment, what they're doing
is trying to transform
those virtual assets
wITH the finance they obtain via QE
into real assets,
and so private equity firms
are going around the world
grabbing up every asset
they can land their hands on.
So, we learnt of the power of the State
to subordinate capital
through the pandemic,
but we haven't learned
how to hold that power
because, of course,
capitalism has reclaimed...
is now exalting in
all of those subsidies
and those bailouts
and using that to even
consolidate themselves even more
than they did in 1933
and 1971.
I'll stop at that point.
[Noam] Well, just adding a word to that:
I think the pandemic has brought out
with extraordinary clarity
the pathological elements
in the State Capitalist System
which are also preventing us
from dealing with
the global climate crisis,
which is far more severe.
Just a very simple fact,
which we all know.
Everyone, the leaders of all 
countries understand very well,
that the pandemic is
an international crisis.
If they continue what they've been doing,
as we all know,
is monopolizing two things:
monopolizing 
the vaccines for themselves
and preserving the property rights,
- the illegitimate property rights -
of the manufacturers.
Those are the two major principles
that the leaders of the world
have been following:
make sure that Big Pharma
gets exorbitant profits
because of the illegitimate property
rights that we've granted to them
in the neoliberal globalization system.
Insist on that,
and also insist on
using the vaccines for ourselves.
They all know perfectly well
that this is a suicide pact.
They know perfectly well that
as long as they withold -
prevent a People's Vaccine,
as India and South Africa
and others have called for,
preserve the right of
the big pharmaceutical corporations
to control not only the product
but also, crucially, the process.
Something that was granted to them
in the WTO negotiations.
Never existed before,
Control the process,
so others can't manufacture it.
So long as they insist on that,
most of the world is not going
to get vaccinated,
is not going to be protected for years.
Which means, that the virus
will mutate,
may turn into forms that are
far more lethal.
Maybe, forms that
can't be even dealt with
by current understanding and technology.
It'll all seep back to the rich countries
and destroy them, too.
But it doesn't matter
as long as we can make
short-term profit for the powerful,
doesn't matter if we kill ourselves
in the long run
as long as the very rich
can make profit
and protect themselves in the short run.
Translate that into the global warming,
into Glasgow,
that's what you see happening.
We're going to make short...
As you all know,
the biggest delegation in Glasgow by far
was the lobbyists
and they were there to make sure
that the very rich
and the corporate sector
can make as much money as possible,
while dooming the world
and their own grandchildren
to utter catastrophe.
That's the pathology
at the core of the system,
and that has to be weeded out.
It's made clear in the response
to the pandemic,
very clear in the response
or lack of response
to the far more serious problem
of destroying the global commons,
and we have to recognize the depth
of that pathology,
root it out,
turn to the commitment
of general populations
to the form of cooperative,
mutual aid, mutual support,
which we've also seen in the pandemic.
One of the striking things
in the pandemic
is how in communities,
very poor communities,
people have just gotten together
to help each other.
If there's some elderly person
stuck in his house and can't get food
they'll bring him food.
This has taken place in
the most amazing circumstances.
One of the most remarkable
is in the Brazilian favelas,
these miserable, hideous communities
which are run by criminal gangs,
all involved in the drug trade.
Well, it turns out that the criminal gangs
organized something
the State wouldn't do:
the criminal gangs organized
the favelas to bring water to people
who needed it,
to bring help
to people who needed it,
with the cooperation of local people.
Humans are capable of overcoming
the crisis
and we have to bring out
those capacities of humans,
not the pathological ones
of those
who are in
a ruling dominating situation,
not because they're bad people,
because that's the nature
of the institutions.
All of that has to be dismantled.
[Yanis] Hear hear!
I just want to add a couple
of numbers.
One is by last May,
I think it's more now,
but last May
when I was keeping tabs,
the major central banks had printed
9,000 billion dollars
and given it to financiers,
who then gave it to companies
who then took it to the stock exchange
where they bought back
their own shares
to increase their share price.
So, nine thousand billion
was wasted on that.
At the same time,
the IMF, International Monetary Fund,
had estimated that it would cost
only about 50 billion
to vaccinate the whole world,
even if they paid the crazy prices
that Pfizer and everybody else wanted.
So they printed 9,000 billion.
It would have taken them 50
to vaccinate the world
and it didn't do it!
You just need to state it!
You don't need to say anything
more than that!
So the money tree is there.
It is producing oodles of money
for the haves.
It could save us from climate extinction,
from climate catastrophe,
from pandemics,
but they proved,
just to misquote Noam,
they prove that the State
is more criminal
than the criminal gangs
in the favelas.
Noam, Ann,
thank you so much,
we've come to the end
of our hour.
It was a great joy
to talk to both of you.
We need to stop doing it
in two dimensions
and go back to three dimensions.
I want to thank the audience
for being with us.
I want to to encourage you
to join DiEM25
because we are doing
an enormous amount of work.
Yesterday, in Berlin,
we founded our new political party there,
because we need a new progressive
political party in Germany.
We are doing transnational politics
in order to bring together progressives
because the fascists
and the bankers are together.
It's about time we go together!
So, please join DiEM25
and contribute to our efforts.
We are part of
the Progressive International.
We helped set it up.
Both Noam and Ann are part of this,
as are our friends
from all over the world,
please join DiEM25 and join the PI
and do contribute a little bit of money,
because the financers have a lot
and the progressives have
very very little to do the work
on a daily basis.
Look, I said it, I'm not very good
at fundraising, but I tried it!
I've been pushed to do it!
Noam and Ann,
thank you so much!
[Noam and Ann] Thank you!
