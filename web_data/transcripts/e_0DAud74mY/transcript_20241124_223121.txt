>> THEA KEITH-LUCAS: Good afternoon, everybody, 
I'm Thea Keith-Lucas, coordinator of the Radius  
program. Thank you all for your patience and 
for joining us today. We look forward to your  
questions which we ask you to share by typing in 
the Q&A box as we open up later in the program. 
We're honored to welcome Professor Noam Chomsky 
and grateful for his long service to MIT as a  
linguist and a cultural critic. I'll now turn it 
over to our esteemed colleague, Subrata Ghoshroy.  
Subrata Ghoshroy is the 
organizer of this seminar; he's  
a former U.S. congressional science fellow and 
member of the professional staff of the U.S.  
House Armed Services Committee. In addition to 
his position as a research affiliate in the MIT  
program in Science Technology and Society, 
he's currently a visiting professor and  
you can find a link to his recent paper on missile 
defense in the Bulletin from Atomic Scientists. 
Subrata, would you please continue.
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: Thank you  
for the introduction.
So welcome to MIT! Once again where you have  
taught so many years and also participated 
in so many other things on social justice. 
Noam Chomsky does not need an introduction, it is 
just that he is the Institute Professor at MIT and  
now for the past couple of years he's--amazingly 
enough that --he's taken up teaching, research,  
guiding students at the University of Arizona 
and you can, of course find more information on  
Noam on the web. Given that we lost some time, 
I won't waste any more time with introducing  
further Noam Chomsky. Everybody knows him.
I'm going to go straight to the format of this  
seminar-- which is Professor Noam Chomsky and 
I discussed the format and decided it would  
probably be easier for everybody if we have sort 
of an interchange on topics and Noam can respond.  
If at any time, Noam, you want to rear off 
to something I'm missing, something that's  
not something to be highlighted, please feel free 
to do so and talk about whatever is in your mind.
We're at a critical juncture now in U.S. history, 
not only because of all these things that are  
happening with the Supreme Court, with Trump and 
everybody, but this is a very critical election.  
I will have a series of questions on 
the election, but I will start off Noam,  
if okay with you, on a question on COVID pandemic.
We all know the coronavirus is having a second  
surge, our first strategy in the United States 
never ended, we're -- it is now spreading in  
states that were critical to Trump's 
victory, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio  
in 2016. My question to you, apart from everything 
else you wanted to say about the coronavirus,  
do you think that Trump's handling of the 
coronavirus in light of people's own experience  
in his base land will impact this election?
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: I suspect the effect will not be  
very great. Trump has an adoring base 
who are immune to fact and argument.  
They worship the leader and don't seem to 
be swayed on this issue or any other issue. 
It brings up unpleasant memories from my 
childhood in the early 30s watching the  
adoring worship of the leader 
on the part of Facist hordes.  
It is not the same but unfortunately 
reminiscent. As you saw this morning, the  
Supreme Court just gave Trump a lift in Wisconsin,  
denying the request of the governor for more 
time for mail ballots, given the pandemic  
and it is very much up for grabs, even if the best 
estimates are that unless Biden wins by 4, 5%,  
he could lose the electoral college. If 
there is not an overwhelming victory,  
Trump and the Republican party are geared-- 
openly, publicly-- to just challenge the election.  
To find legalistic ways to delay it. 
We may be given the point where on  
January 20th there are two people claiming to be 
president and the military will have to step in,  
something that's never happened in the 
history of parliamentary democracy. 
That’s the situation we're in at this point.
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: Another question related to  
the pandemic, a slightly general question: 
it is: that he's attacked scientists  
regarding climate change science, the science 
of this. Do you think these attacks on the  
institutions of scientists will last or 
will have a lasting impact on the American  
public opinion or is this a passing phenomenon?
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: It already has had an effect  
on American public opinion. You have to bear in 
mind, that about almost half of the population  
is glued to Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, echo chambers 
for the government. They're hearing constantly  
from the sources that they trust and from 
higher officials is that everything is a fraud,  
fake, science. Rush Limbaugh, science is one 
of the four corners of deceit which along with  
media, academia, government, the four corners 
of deceit rely for their survival on deceit.
 
When people have that hammered in their heads, day 
after day, many of them believe it, especially the  
circumstances like today when there's all around 
the world, most of the world, very substantial  
anger, fear, concern, largely as a result of the 
40 years of assault on the publication, greatly  
magnified by Trump and other demigod situations 
which people are inclined to accept conspiracies,  
some exotic beliefs that may make sense with their 
troubled surroundings. There is a study that came  
out this morning showing around the world the 
level of belief in basically crazed stories,  
it is quite astonishing. It appeared 
in the Guardian this morning.
As far as science is concerned, Trump's hatred 
of science began the moment he entered office,  
actually going back before. But there was  
a pandemic response system set in 
motion by Obama on the advice of the  
presidential science advisory council. First days 
in office, Trump dismantled it, totally terminated  
the programs of U.S. scientists working with 
Chinese colleagues and identifying coronavirus,  
defunded the Center for Disease Control. It 
continued every year he was in office, even  
last February. The contempt for science on the 
pandemic is a factor that's led to the huge death  
rate and I presume it will soon hit 300,000. The 
United States-- it is almost in a class by itself. 
The same is true on the much more severe 
problem of global warming and other issues  
on which scientific knowledge is crucial. As far 
as the pandemic is concerned, we can be confident  
that if -- that this will be ended with terrible 
cost, unneeded cost, but others will be coming,  
unless we prepare and pay attention, to 
the scientific information and advice;  
there will be worse ones coming down the road.
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: Trump, of course, calls  
this virus a Chinese virus. Biden hasn't strongly 
opposed that characterization. On the other hand,  
we had a seminar a couple of weeks ago with 
Professor Jonathan King and others about the  
bio safety labs and the safety and the possibility 
that a virus could leak out and there is research.  
Is there any thought on the bio safety 
labs doing this high-risk research when the  
benefits seem to be very few.
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: There are always  
possible accidents. The research is highly 
significant. In 2003, after SARS was contained  
there was discussion on why information in 
the scientific community on what should be  
done--- if we should be prepared for another 
virus that was expected. There is a law of  
research that has to be done on organisms and the 
kind of preparations that have to be done so that  
vaccines can rapidly be developed on the basis of 
scientific knowledge when they come along. Almost  
none of that was done. Drug companies refused to 
do anything. Obama, as I said, he did convene the  
presidential science advisory council. They did 
put in place a fairly decent response system, did  
do the research. But Trump dismantled it. We're in 
an insane situation now. So far we have been kind  
of lucky, there have been coronavirus that are 
highly lethal but not very contagious, like Ebola;  
some are very contagious but not very lethal, 
like COVID-19. Who is to say that the next one  
won't be both highly lethal and highly 
contagious. If we don't prepare for it,  
we're in serious trouble.
 
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: Thank you. 
So you in the beginning alluded to this 
breaking news about the Supreme Court. 
Now we have a solid conservative majority in 
the Supreme Court, 6 - 3. The lower courts have  
been packed by Bush and then Trump appointees 
and the appellant courts, they're filled with  
conservative judges from the Christian right, 
other tendencies. Trump is alluding to the  
Democrats plan to pack the courts if elected. 
What are your thoughts on the situation with  
our courts and what are the recourses?
>>CHOMSKY: Republicans long understood  
that they're basically a minority party and 
they can only survive in the political system  
by various kinds of trickery, especially 
McConnell. It used to be a deliberative body  
to an organization that does nothing but pass 
legislation to benefit the super rich and to pack  
the courts. It is an understandable program 
since we cannot win in the electoral situation,  
let's stack the court with young, ultra-right 
judges that will be able to maintain  
our deeply reactionary policies for a generation 
or more independently of what the public wants. 
The idea is that judges draw their conclusions on 
the basics of law-- it is almost a total farce.  
You can predict the outcome of the decision on the 
basis of the political commitments of the judge. 
Barrett is not only a conservative, but very much 
opposed to science. I'm sure you heard when she  
was asked about global warming, she said, “Well, I 
can't have an opinion on -- I'm not a scientist.”  
That's outlandish. You don't have to be a 
scientist to understand that the world is facing  
the severe threat, and if we don't 
do anything about it soon we,  
as human society, will not survive. You have 
to be literate to know that. Somebody who says  
I don't know is telling us in effect that 
I listen to my Pastor, if my Pastor says  
maybe it is not happening, then it 
is not happening. For that to be  
on the Supreme Court is shocking beyond words.
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: I read somewhere recently  
a Smithsonian article which was excellent 
in terms of the description of the Roosevelt  
campaign in 1936 which he won by a landslide 
and there he faced a similar situation of a  
conservative court and he tried to also apparently 
have a legislation to expand the Supreme Court  
which is what Trump is talking about packing.
Do you have any opinion on that election or how  
Roosevelt failed to do so, but the Supreme Court 
later on went along because of public pressure  
to validate all of the new deal legislation?
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: In 1936, what happened is  
Roosevelt threatened to add justices to the court 
and the court got the message and backed off the  
effort to kill every New Deal legislation, 
and they began at that point to accept  
the New Deal proposals because 
of the threat of court packing. 
I don't think it will happen this time.
We're in a different situation. The right wing  
is much more rabid and extreme than in 1936. Part 
of the reason, it is that they know essentially  
that they're finished. The country is moving in a 
different direction; they can't hold on for long.  
The fate of the deeply reactionary 
currents in American policy rely on  
various imaginations to avoid coming to the public 
for a judgment on election day. They have to avoid  
what appear would be much more rigorous 
this time in trying any tactic to delay  
the threat of their disappearing as a major 
political force which is what is at stake. 
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: I don't know if you 
saw the testimony or the statements made by  
Senator Whitehouse about the tremendous 
organization of right wing forces financed by  
the Koch brothers, Bradley Foundation, 
so forth, in systematically organizing a  
support of people like Amy and other justices, 
that in the lower courts, they have an  
organized approach to packing the court.
On the other hand, I don't think that the  
Democrats highlighted or are focused on this issue 
that's going to last with us for a long time. 
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: First of all, remember the 
Democrats, the official democratic policy  
is moderately cooperative with these policies 
and they don't actually support them, they don't  
strongly oppose them. The Clinton Democrats that 
basically run the party, they are also beholden to  
similar interests. They're a Wall Street based 
conservative party. If you look at international  
comparisons there was a recent one done by a 
major institution in Sweden, several other,  
the Republicans today are ranked alongside 
the far right parties in Europe with  
neofacist origins and the Democrats are a 
centralist party by European standards, not a  
social democratic party. They have been 
pushed to the left by popular pressures;  
their voting base is shifting. The DNC itself 
is resisting. You can see it very clearly  
on climate policies. Biden and Harris were pressed 
by popular activism to move towards fairly decent  
climate program, not sufficient, but more 
reasonable than any other that's been around.
 
The DNC has tried to kill it, has tried to push 
it back and there is a battle inside of the  
democratic party on that. Same as other things. 
There is a -- there is a chance that Roberts--who  
knows that the court will be called the Roberts 
Court-- won't want to see it totally discredited.  
He's shown signs of trying to make it look like it 
is a functioning court on issues that are not of  
primary concern to his -- to the 
extreme wealth, he may try to  
moderate the court to make it not look like 
just a comic strip, which it is becoming.  
I think the chances are pretty poor. We 
should remember that the United States,  
even apart from Trump, the United States is 
facing a Constitutional crisis, a serious  
Constitutional crisis. If in the 18th 
century the U.S. constitution was a  
moderately progressive document, even though 
it was strongly opposed to democracy---there  
was no secret about it-- but by the standard 
of the 18th century, it was a step forward.  
By the 20th century, it is not. If it was 
-- if the United States were try enter the  
European Union-- it would be turned down. 
Look at the Senate: it affects the Electoral  
College, so it is so radically undemocratic 
that a modern democracy would not tolerate it.
The same is true of what you mentioned: 
enormous power of private wealth. Take  
global warming again, look what happened. A 
decade ago, 2008 John McCain ran for president  
on the Republican ticket and he had a limited but 
actual global warming element in the platform. The  
Republican Senate was beginning to move towards 
limited actions on global warming. The Koch  
network, which had been pouring money 
into preventing the Republicans from  
moving away from total denialism, went practically 
berserk. David Coke, he launched a huge campaign  
to intimidate senators, to threatening to 
run candidates against them, bribing them,  
rogue lobbying campaign, AstroTurf 
campaign, they turned the entire Republican  
leadership, most of the party, they just followed 
the orders and turned -- withdrew from their  
limited efforts on climate change.
Now they're a denialist party. It is  
remarkable, when you look at the 2016 primary, the 
last Republican primary, every candidate either  
denied that global warming is taking place or 
said maybe it is, but it doesn't matter. The most  
forthcoming of them, the one praised as being the 
adult in the room, John Kasich, governor of Ohio,  
considered so moderate he was even invited to talk 
at the 2020 Democratic convention-- he was praised  
because he was the one ?? there who said, yes, 
global warming is taking place. But then he added:  
yes, it is taking place, but we in Ohio 
are going to use our coal resources and  
not apologize for it. He was the worst of all 
of them. He said, yes, we're racing to disaster,  
we don't care, we'll go faster. It is not 
even jobs that are at stake, that's a joke. 
Many have worked on this for years: it 
has been found that 1,000 jobs a year  
are at stake in Ohio. It is nothing. 
There are many more jobs and better  
jobs available in renewable energy. This is 
a matter of preserving the most destructive  
enterprises in world history, in 
fact. The ones who are bent on getting  
the last cent of profit that they can before 
the fossil industry collapses as they must. 
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: We just had a very good 
talk by Heidi Peltier just last week from  
Boston University. She's a PhD in economics 
from the University of Massachusetts Amherst  
and she had a good analysis over this impact 
on jobs, on spending on all of this military  
spending. And another thing, that's in the 
talk: it is this $740 billion defense spending  
when we don't have money to support our workers, 
unemployment and healthcare and so forth.. 
The U.S. elections, on this regard, I 
was going to ask you a few questions,  
but you are already touching 
on some of them of course. 
You had mentioned in your talks that 
this is really a historic election  
and other people have said similarly.
Now, Trump's transgressions, they're transparent,  
everybody sees that. Do you see it fundamentally 
as a different sort of choice that we face  
despite the fact that the DNC, et cetera, they're 
very much beholden to the same kinds of interests? 
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: Sorry, I didn't catch 
it exactly. Could you say that again? 
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: I was asking you: you have 
characterized this election as a historic election  
and then you also mention about the problems with 
the DNC, kinds of interests they're beholden to,  
for a lot of people, Biden was not the first 
choice or second choice, but we have Biden, now,  
against Trump. Can you clarify the historic 
nature of this election in your thoughts?
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: Most important 
election that's ever taken place.  
If Trump is reelected, the chances of human 
survival in any organized form is shortly reduced.  
Four more years of Trump's assault against 
the environment might lead us to irreversible  
tipping points at the least, making it 
considerably more difficult to address  
the severe crisis of environmental catastrophe 
within the limited time that's available to us.
We have the means to deal with it, they're not out 
of sight, it is feasible, but not a lot of time.  
Maybe 10, 20 years, cutoff 
another four years from that  
and a race in the wrong 
direction makes it much harder.  
It might be almost a lethal blow. It is not 
this alone. Trump is tearing to shreds, the  
remnants of the arm control regime, which has 
offered some limited mitigation, the threat of  
nuclear destruction, carrying a highly -- carrying 
out provocative acts, raising the chance of war,  
developing more destructive weapons. This is as 
severe as the climate crisis and he's racing in  
that direction quite apart while the American 
democracy is being dismantled. The executive  
branch has been purged of any dissenting voice 
when Inspector Generals began to investigate the  
swamp of corruption he's created, he's fired them. 
The latest move is to say he may not leave office;  
in the office-- a plan to dismantle the civil 
service, the backbone of the functioning country,  
dismantle it, replace it by his own event. 
He's saying let's destroy the system. 
So put it altogether: racing to the abyss 
on global warming, dismantling arms control,  
intrigues, the threat of nuclear 
war, which is very serious,  
tearing to shreds the remnants of American 
democracy, I won't even talk about the pandemic.  
This is a crisis of major proportions.
>> SUBRATA GHOSHROY: Do you think that  
the foundation for this situation was laid 
by primarily during the Bush administration  
after the 9/11 attacks and that the Patriot 
Act, warrantless wiretapping, no fly lists,  
attacks on academics, campuses for 
their speaking out, of course the  
creation of this atmosphere against the Muslims, 
so forth, and you had mentioned -- I was thinking  
that sort of -- I was there, people are afraid, 
then Obama year, you had mentioned your interview  
with others that -- I think to paraphrase that the 
Obama was a disappointment. And then came Trump  
and we have this situation.
 
>> NOAM CHOMSKY: Obama was more  
than a disappointment. He was a betrayal of many 
working people who voted for Obama believing his  
nice rhetoric were quickly betrayed so, fast, 
that by 2010, two years, as you remember,  
in Massachusetts, the election to replace Kennedy 
went to Republican, even union voters backed away  
from Obama. He betrayed them. Clearly with 
the Bailout. Congress, you remember, passed  
legislation for the bailout after the financial 
crisis, had two parts, one part was to  
payoff the perpetrators of the crisis, the banks, 
with their predatory lending practices. So pay  
them off, but the other part, it was support 
the victims, the people who lost their homes  
with foreclosures, so on, the victims 
of this. Didn't do anything about it.  
People could see that it was a total 
betrayal and it continued among other things.
The problem goes way beyond Obama, we have been 
living through 40 years of a neoliberal assault  
that was designed so it would harm 
the general population. It was clear  
and explicit, just look at the beginning of 
it: Ronald Regan: government is the problem,  
decisions have to be taken out of the 
hands of government, they don't disappear,  
they go somewhere else. Where do they go? 
Unaccountable, private, corporate bodies,  
that's where decisions shift, then comes the 
guru, Milton Freidman, with a major article  
at the time saying that corporation's sole 
responsibilities is to enrich themselves;  
they have no commitment to the workforce or to the 
community. Just put these three things together:  
what prediction do you make? An on 
advice one and we see the results.  
The Rand corporation just came out with a 
major study in which they try to estimate  
the wealth that had been transferred 
from the middle class, the working class  
to the super rich during the 40 years, 
the lower 90%. To the top fraction of 1%:  
$47 trillion-dollars. That's a lot of money and 
people -- they may not know the details. They  
can see it in their lives. Wages stagnated 
for the majority, CEO salaries, they have  
shot through the stratosphere bringing others 
with them, the top 0.1% of the population  
has doubled its share of wealth since 
Regan from 10% to 20% and for the rest,  
trying to get by from paycheck to paycheck on 
precarious jobs. Yes, that's the background.  
Out of that arises an extreme malignancy, 
Trump, extreme malignancy which magnifies all  
of it and that's coming to a head right now.
END RECORDING—Chomsky had technical issues
