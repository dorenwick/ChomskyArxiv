okay well thanks so much uh
for joining us name
the last time um i interviewed you
you said memorably that we were at the
most dangerous moment in
human history do you think we're in an
even more dangerous moment now there is
no one other than donald trump
in history who has done more
to try to drive the human race to
extinction
that's the meaning of what we don't
bother talking about
namely his dedication
to maximizing the use of fossil fuels
and to cutting back
all
regulations that might restrict them
because of
his fanaticism about this
the worshipful base of the republican
party
uh by now
barely
regards
uh climate change as a serious problem
that's a death warrant to the sea
to the species
i mean we prefer to talk about other
things but that's the overriding concern
nothing else matters
if we move towards
destruction of the
possibility for organized human life on
earth
in the near future
what do you think have been
the most important consequences of
russia's invasion of ukraine
well many consequences
monstrous for ukraine of course
uh
there are
there have been possibilities for a
peaceful settlement
still there
us is not pursuing them britain is not
pursuing them but they're there
oh there are other consequences
one
is just what we've been talking about
it's reversing
sharply
the limited much too limited efforts to
deal with the
existential crisis of environmental
destruction
we've just received
last august
the most dire report yet
from the ipcc
warned that we must begin immediately
to
start reducing
fossil fuel use
and we we must systematically do that
every year
till there until we stop using them
completely if not
we'll pass irreversible tipping points
so what has happened
well what has happened now is
the euphoria in the offices
of the
oil companies
even exceeds that of the
joy in the offices of the weapons
manufacturers
now they're
free from all of this
carping by
uh tree huggers and now they're being
admired
they want to be hugged as they put it
their words we want to be hugged because
we're saving civilization by rapidly
increasing the use of fossil fuels
and that's what's happening
that's one consequence of the invasion
there are others
putin
provided the united states with the most
welcome gift
that it could possibly imagine
uh over the through the throughout the
whole cold war
there's been a
background
debate
about the status of europe
there are two pictures
should europe be subordinate to the
united states
uh simply follow u.s orders
within the
atlanticists nato framework
or should europe
seek to move towards an independent role
in world affairs
maybe along the lines proposed by
the goal uh
pressed to some extent by the bronte and
his host politique
and now slightly pushed by
imanuel macron
and his
comments for
calling for
moderation and move to
lead to some negotiated settlement which
separates him from other
european leaders well
of course the united states prefers the
atlanticist nato
vision
not the the goal gorbachev
vision of a common european home
independent of the united states
putin in his
foolish criminality
has driven europe deep into the u.s
pocket
now it's just a flack for the united
states
uh it's pretty astonishing to observe
well that's another consequence of the
ukraine invasion
the main thing we should be concerned
about
is what can we do
to save ukraine from further disaster
and
one of the things we could do is be
honest about western policy
so for example western policy is
u.s policy at least
is stated very clearly
very explicitly
in a
crucial document
that the press in the united states
maybe in britain
has
refused to report
september
2021
last september
the biden administration
produced
a crucial policy statement
it's called a joint statement on
strategic cooperation with ukraine
that's operative american policy
nothing could be more important now
it calls for
that encourage further encouragement to
ukraine to join nato
doors wide open
calls for
enhancing
u.s ukraine military cooperation
sending advanced weapons
uh
other such provisions i'm sorry i can't
quote it from memory
uh all as part of the
ukraine
and a
nato enhancement program
well it's
perfectly possible every year
for years
uh putin has been carrying out
mobilization
of russian forces
on the ukraine border
february or march
in an effort to try to get the united
states
to pay some attention
to the
appeals uh concerns about russian
security
that have been voiced by every russian
leader
back to yeltsin
in the late 90s gorbachev
every russian leader
it's recognized
by a host high level
us diplomats
to be a serious concern
warnings to the u.s from george kennan
henry kissinger
cia director
william burns previous cia director
stansfield turner
or
william perry secretary of defense
virtually resigned when clinton decided
to break the
bush baker promise to gorbachev not to
extend to the east it's been going for
25 years
every year there's a russian
mobilization
to try to break the silence
this year
putin went further
escalated
to criminal aggression
well why did he do it
there are two ways of looking at this
question
one way the fashionable way in the west
is to plumb the recesses of putin's
twisted mind and
try to determine what's happening in his
deep psyche but the other way would be
to look at the facts
for example to look at the fact that
in september
2021
the united states came out with a strong
policy statement
calling for enhancement of u.s
efforts military cooperation
with ukraine
further
sending of advanced military weapons
military
operation joint military operations all
part of the
enhancement program of
the ukraine joining nato
there would be one possibility to look
at that okay you can take your choice
the fashionable way is
a deep analysis of
putin's soul
it's a choice
we don't know which is right
what we do know
is that
ukraine will be further devastated
and we may
move on to
terminal nuclear war
if we do not pursue the opportunities
that exist for a negotiated settlement
now anyone
who has a functioning brain
knows that a
negotiated settlement
will have to leave some kind of an
escape for putin
if you tell putin our policy is you
gotta go
nothing for you we're gonna smash you
he'll go for brook
what else is he going to do
and the worst will happen
so if you really
hate ukrainians and you want them to
suffer as much as possible
and you want to raise the possibility of
war
what you should do is avoid the
opportunities for negotiations
uh insist on policies like
the september 2021 policy
and uh
call for no-fly zones other things
that'll lead to an escalation of the war
that's an option
the other option
is to pursue the negotiation
possibilities that exist
to follow
and they do they're
reduced to recognize
that any settlement
is going to have to be
pretty much along the lines of what
zelinski recently proposed
and the u.s rejects
has to be along those lines
neutralization of ukraine
some sort of settlement
about the
donbass region
some form of autonomy maybe some form of
federalism
and and putting off
the crimea issue
because it can't can't be settled
within any kind of time span that would
save ukraine from destruction
and the world from the threat of war
that's if we want
to settle the situation
if we want
ukraine to suffer more
we can follow hillary clinton's advice
joyous
proposal to set up an afghan-style
insurgency
in ukr in ukraine
to drain the russians and to massacre
ukrainians okay
you can do that if you like it
uh
or you can follow
basically zolensky's proposals
my cornell's proposals
those proposed by
serious analysts
people like anatol davin who actually
know something about the situation
and have been
right about it all along
those are the options
joe biden's been um much criticized for
his erratic messaging on ukraine
most recently calling for
putin's departure what do you make of
his performance during the crisis
it was an ad lib statement
which
caused
great consternation
uh
because of the obvious consequences for
ukraine and the world
his staff
immediately
uh withdrew the statement
approached the press to say he didn't
mean what he said don't pay attention to
it
now there's a second reaction coming
including from liberals in the united
states
saying he should be praised for the
statement
he expressed
the
natural
moral outrage that we all feel
for the genocide
that putin is carrying out in ukraine
okay so he should be praised
well you might tickle ukraine is a
horrible monstrosity is it genocide
if it's genocide what term do we use for
the u.s uk
uh actions which are vastly worse
okay what term do we use for them what
term do we use for the fact
where is the moral outrage yes it's
certainly right to have moral outrage
about putin's actions in ukraine
it would be even more proper far more to
have moral outrage about things
horrible atrocities going on right now
which we can act to end
far more important so take afghanistan
in afghanistan
literally
millions of people
are facing
imminent starvation
why
there's food in the markets
but people who have
money little money
have to watch their children starve
because they can't go to the market to
buy food
why
because the united states with the
backing of britain
has
kept
afghanistan's funds in new york banks
and will not release them
so that
poor afghans can go to the bank and get
a little money to save their children
from starvation
hundreds of thousands maybe millions
of course there's a pretext
pretext is even more shameful
disgraceful than the practice
the pretext is will americans
might want the reparations for crimes
committed in 9 11.
so therefore we have to ensure
that millions of afghans face starvation
and this is praised in the west in the
united states and britain
afghans had nothing to do with 9 11
nothing
you might remember if our memory is
permitted
that the taliban offered full
surrender
total surrender
meaning handing over to the united
states
the suspects
from al-qaeda and remember they were
suspects
the fbi said
we don't know
maybe they're responsible maybe not
but they agreed to hand over the
suspects and the u.s responded
donald rumsfeld
the architect of the
crime of invasion
donald rumsfeld said
we do not negotiate surrenders
president george w bush echoed it
we do not negotiate surrenders we're
going to smash you up good
for the crime that you did not commit
and now we're going to ensure
that you and your children starve
because maybe americans
might like
might call for reparations for what you
didn't do and we have no moral outrage
about that have you heard any
i haven't is anybody calling for it
well we can go on
the united states and britain
right now
are providing
arms to saudi arabia
the saudi arabian and emirati
air forces cannot function
without u.s british
plan
training intelligence spare parts and so
on
and what are they doing with the gift
that we are now giving them
well for example they're blockading the
soul
saudi arabia is enhanced its blockade of
the soul port
from which
yemenis can import
food and oil they've now enhanced it
the u.n their the official death toll
last year
was 370 thousand killed
mostly the result of saudi emirati
attacks with u.s british help
we don't know the actual death toll
nobody can count we do know that the
united nations
describing it as the worst humanitarian
disaster in the world
recently issued warnings that hundreds
of thousands of yemeni children face
imminent starvation these warnings are
backed up
by high
expert u.s
officials bruce riedel
cia director for four
presidents amplifies the warnings
or
calls for saudi arabia to be charged
with war crimes
too polite to say that the united states
and uk
are directly involved in them
how about some moral outrage about that
that's something we can stop
we can stop it tomorrow
okay
well any moral outrage
not too hard to go on
so yes we should have moral outrage
about ukraine
and we should act to try to stop the
crimes instead of enhancing them
and we should have much more moral
outrage
about crimes that we are now engaged in
and we can stop
therefore they're far more important
on any
by
any moral principle that we can imagine
but these things can't be discussed
not in
uh societies like the united states and
britain
where you have where the intellectual
classes
have to be
highly conformist
to
state doctrine
not raise any questions there's a few
outsiders at the extremes who do
but not the mainstream and you can see
it by the coverage of things like what
we're just talking about
which is nothing new incidentally
take
take the invasion of iraq
a far worse crime than putin's
incomparably worse
the kind of crime
it was what the nuremberg judgment
called the supreme international crime
for which nazi war criminals were hanged
at nuremberg
well you can tell me about the united
states and uk i don't read the press
regularly
in the united states to this day
no one
except
at the very fringe
is able to say what i just said
now the harshest criticism that can be
made of the war
was
it was strategic blunder
obama
highly praised for calling the war a
strategic brunder
did we praise russian generals
in the early 80s for calling the russian
of invasion of afghanistan a strategic
blunder
not that i recall uh do we praise
american leaders for doing the same
to the skies
can anyone tell the truth about it
no
it gets worse
the 2 we've just passed the 20th
anniversary of the invasion of
afghanistan
serious crime
destroyed the country
well
it was a perpetrator
his name is george w bush
there was an actually an interview with
him on the 20th anniversary
praise to the american press they
interviewed him
in the washington post
in the style
section
it was an interview of this
goofy
lovable grandpa
playing with his grandchildren
and showing the portraits
a hole that he painted of all the
wonderful people he met
that's the interview the soul interview
on the 20th anniversary
of the invasion of afghanistan
a country which we are now
at this moment driving to
terrifying disaster
by refusing
to release the funds
that would allow
poor afghans to buy a little food for
their starving children
that's us
you can describe to me how it was
handled in the uk
well do we want to face the facts about
ourselves
or do we want to posture
heroically with uh
winston churchill impersonations
about uh how we have to defend ukraine
from genocide
to choice
and it's a very important point but just
to um return to ukraine um
what's your response to those who say
that um
for putin
citing nato expansion is just a fig leaf
and now what he really fears is the
spread of
liberal democracy putin is as concerned
about democracy as we are
uh if it's possible to break out of the
propaganda bubble for a few minutes
and to look at the record
the u.s has a long
record
of
undermining and destroying democracy
do i have to run through it
you you ran in 1953
1954
in chile and
1973
on and on okay
it's a long record of opposition to
democracy
and contempt for sovereignty
but the we are supposed to now
uh
uh honor and
admire
washington's enormous commitment to
sovereignty and democracy
what happened in history doesn't matter
that's for other people
we live in an orwellian world no history
well what about
the nato expansion
there was a clear
explicit
unambiguous promise
by
james baker
and president h.w bush to gorbachev that
if he agreed
to allow
a unified germany
to rejoin
nato
the united states
would ensure
that there would be no move one inch to
the east
there's a good deal of lying going on
about this now
pretending he didn't say it it was just
a hypothesis
i would therefore suggest
that you look at the national security
archives
the authoritative account
of the actual
records and documents just read it it's
an unambiguous
clear
promise
and exactly what i said
bush lived up to it
clinton lived up to it during his first
term
in 1998
probably with an eye on the polish vote
he was a political animal
he offered
membership
in nato to poland
romania
slovenia
he was bitterly condemned
for this
by as i said
a whole host of high-level dictionaries
cannon
kissinger
matlock ambassador matlock leading
russia specialist in a diplomatic corps
william perry defense secretary
correctly resigned in protest
long list of others
a letter by
50 leading
specialists warning him not to do this
he didn't care
uh
yeltsin
objected strongly gorbachev objected who
cares
the george w bush came along
he threw the door open
brought in a whole host of others
offered the door open door to ukraine
every
u.s
diplomat and analyst including the cia
director and a former one
understand
that georgia and ukraine are red lines
for every russian leader
they were willing to tolerate the
breaking of the promise
for the
democracy for the countries on their
border but not ukraine and georgia
that no russian leader would tolerate
every u.s
high-level diplomat and specialist
understands that
so therefore
in september
2021
the u.s government
through the door even wider open to
ukraine and called for enhancing
u.s
military cooperation
advanced weapons
training for ukraine as part of the
advanced
ukraine nato enhancement deal
well
those
that's
the mere facts of the matter
is
it's much more convenient
to
look into putin's soul and say he's
opposed to democracy
unlike us with our
fervent love for democracy
is there any wonder why the global south
is exploding in ridicule
as it watches this performance of europe
and the united states
they have a little experience with
british american
love for democracy and sovereignty
you mentioned donald trump earlier how
worried are you about him potentially
returning to office
if donald trump comes to office
we can be confident
that we will
carry forward the escalation
of the race
to
utter catastrophe
through destruction of the environment
he's perfectly clear about it
his troops are calling for it
uh the republican party
in congress right now
has been
dedicated to blocking any move
the slightest move
towards mitigating climate
uh climate disaster 100 percent rock
solid
biden didn't have great progress but he
had some programs
for
dealing with the climate catastrophe
every single one
is blocked by a hundred percent
republican opposition
with the cooperation of
one democrat
joe manchin
cole magnate
became a multi-millionaire through his
coal business
leading recipient of coal mining funding
he goes along with him
incidentally the united mine workers in
west virginia his state
they have agreed
to a transition program away from coal
towards renewable energy but not mansion
and not 100 republicans
republican base
following their
leader they worship trump
no barely
regards
global warming as a problem
so what can we expect when he comes back
to office
is it a real question
we can also expect further steps towards
destruction of american democracy
which is well underway
uh the republicans
used to be an authentic political party
i've voted for republicans in the past
you could like them or not but they were
an authentic party
that
pretty much stopped
back in the mid 90s
when newt gingrich took over and turned
them into a
denialist party
reject anything that democrats do
uh mitch mcconnell the current
republican leader is explicit about it
he said our prime concern he said this
with obama has repeated it now
our prime concern
is to ensure
that the democrats can do nothing
because then we can come back to power
let's harm the country as much as
possible so we can regain power
and we can then continue with
voter repression
uh with the help of the reactionary
supreme court
with
radical
measures to
ensure that
the wrong people
minorities
aren't able to
vote to ensure to develop a
christian nationalist white supremacist
country
which they're trying to do
very hard that's why the republicans
know
uh their
the republican party is now
glorifying
victor orban
and and his uh
illiberal democracy in
uh
in hungary the europe's protesting
against it not the republicans
fox news
tucker carlson a host of others
are praising
ukraine for moving towards a
christian nationalist
white
uh
illiberal
uh
quasi-democracy which will undermine it
that's the republican party
try to find an exception
i mean there are people who don't like
it particularly
but they're going along because they're
afraid of the hordes the
moms that
trump
has managed to mobilize
they terrify all of them
they're afraid if they say anything
they'll be a primary in which they'll be
opposed by this massive force with
plenty of money behind it uh
oil executives tons of others well
that's i mean there is much talk has
been for years about
american decline
most of it i
don't think is
meaningful but one thing is true
the country is
undermining itself from within
seriously undermining itself from within
when that happens in hungary
it's bad
when that happens in the most powerful
country in world history
it's a catastrophe
not just for the country but the world
and as long as it's
british poodle
chirps behind it and supports it all
makes it even worse
well we had break i
looked up the actual wording
of
official policy
the joint statement so i'll
read it
the most important document
to pay attention to right now
first of all
forcefully declares
that ukraine
must be free to join nato it finalized a
strategic defense framework that creates
a foundation for the enhancement of u.s
ukraine strategic defense and security
cooperation
by providing ukraine with advanced
anti-tank and other weapons along with a
robust training and exercise program
in keeping with ukraine's status as a
nato enhanced opportunities partner
that's what
putin was reading
though not americans and british the
press was kind enough to save us from it
but you can be pretty sure that the
russians are reading it
from a uk perspective i wanted to ask
what what do you make of the labour
party's trajectory under kirstalma well
it's very important
to continue the
elite program pretty much across the
spectrum
to destroy
corbyn and everything that he stood for
the it's intolerable to elite british
opinion
that there should be a labour party that
actually responds to its constituents
a labour party that is concerned with
the interests of working people
and works for their benefit
that pursues the policies that
won a big labor majority in
2017 terrifying the establishment so
that has to be killed
it was killed with lots of fakery about
anti-semitism
deplorable attacks
others
uh and keith stormers carrying it
forward
he's returning the labor party to a
party that's reliably
obedient to power
that will be uh
thatcher light
in the style of tony blair
and won't ruffle feathers of either the
united states or anyone who's important
in britain
i think he's doing a good job of that
what would your
advice be to those on the
left of the democratic party
it's a mixed story
there are the there's the left component
in congress
what they sometimes call the quad
alexandria ocasio-cortez
representative jayapal
who runs the progressive caucus
few others
they
they have been taking what in my opinion
at least is a
very sensible position by and large
jayapal particularly is
very careful with her parliamentary
maneuvers has tried to
push forward
the more positive elements of the biden
program
while trying to block
the
uh
100 percent
republican opposition to anything that
might benefit the country
ocasio-cortez
along with
representative
senator ed markey senior senator from
massachusetts
the two of them
put forth
a
very carefully designed program for a
green new deal
pretty much along the lines of the
international energy commission
others
my co-author robert pollan
economist who's worked on it in great
detail
jeffrey sachs others pretty much agreed
uh they introduced the resolution in
2019.
of course it got nowhere republicans
won't even allow it to be looked at
they reintroduced it
last year
still no resonance
it's the kind of program that is
necessary
if we're going to survive
well as i mentioned before
biden had some
positive elements in his program
they were killed
by a hundred percent
republican opposition
along with right-wing democrats mansion
in particular
but the corte casio cortez marquis
program
is a necessity for survival
and the
left democrats and congress are lined up
behind it along with a few others
not enough
to break the
right wing
block
it's worth remembering how tight this is
the republican party
has stated
explicitly it's
red lines
things it will not permit to be touched
and that gives you a good indication of
what's going to happen when they
probably retake congress in
november and then on to 2024.
take a look at them
the red lines are
nothing can touch
their one
legislative achievement
when trump was in office
the
2017
tax bill
which was a giveaway
to the super rich and the corporate
sector stabbing everyone else in the
back
joe stiglitz continued in economy
economic economics called it the donor
relief act of 2017
about what it was
so that can't be touched
we have to continue with our total
subordination total service to the super
rich and the corporate sector
the second thing that can't be touched
is defunding
the internal revenue service
it's been defunded for years
and the republicans insist that that be
continued
why
because the internal revenue service
goes after tax cheating
tax cheating doesn't occur among poor
people
they pay what limited tax there is
tax cheating
is a huge industry
among the super rich
tax havens shell companies
huge batteries of corporate lawyers
figuring out more ways to rob the public
it's in the
nobody knows how much tens of trillions
of dollars
and that can't be touched
okay
we gotta ensure that tax cheating
continue
that's the republican party
also block anything that might deal with
the climate change
ensure that the military budget keeps
expanding uh
that's the republican
organization i hate to call them a party
they're not a party anymore
they were described by uh
one of the main
most respected political analysts norman
ornstein of the
conservative american enterprise
institute
about 10 years ago he described the
republican party as
no longer a political party a radical
insurgency
dedicated
to undermining parliamentary politics
in the interests of their masters
and that's
right in front of our eyes
we can continue to pretend that it's a
republic a party if we like
but as we can pretend that the
u.s and britain support democracy we can
pretend whatever we like
but those are the clear
unmistakable facts
and that's what we're facing
in november
when they come likely come back to power
even more so in 2024
and recall that by now
trump
is out flanked from the right
he's by no me he gets booed at
conferences because he's not
extremist enough
what has happened
i mean i'm old enough to remember
the early 1930s
and memories come to mind
i can remember
listening to
hitler's speeches on the radio
i didn't understand the words i was
six years old
but i understood the mood
and it was frightening
and terrifying
and when you watch
one of trump's rallies
that can't fail to come to mind
that's what we're facing
it's not fascism
but it's a move in that direction
an unmistakable move and
this is not hungary
it's the most powerful state in world
history
what it does
it's going to have a massive effect on
others
we haven't talked about other things
that are urgent
one of them
is the current
biden policy towards china
current policy
announced by trump
expanded by
biden
is to set up is to as they put it
encircle china
encircle china
with
sentinel
states a ring of states hostile states
from
south korea taiwan
japan
australia
uh
new zealand
india is a reluctant participant
surround them singapore
states
which biden administration just recently
is now equipping with more advanced
precision guided missiles aiming at
china
okay
we have to
protect ourselves from the china threat
by
imposing
a massive threat against china
with british cooperation
the united states
has sent australia
a fleet ascending australia a fleet of
nuclear submarines
patrol the
seas off china's coast china has nothing
remotely like them
they're still using the
1970s diesel-powered submarines but we
have to that's the
orca steel britain the united states
australia
killed the french
deal with uh
australia for
submarines they weren't advanced enough
france was of course furious
but it doesn't matter we have to
increase the threat against china
by making sure that they're facing
advanced
missiles nuclear submarines which are
advertised publicly as being able to
enter chinese ports silently
and to attack any chinese city
meanwhile the united states is upgrading
its own nuclear submarine force the
current ones aren't powerful enough the
trident submarines
they're only powerful enough so that one
one
submarine with trident missiles
can destroy almost 200 cities anywhere
in the world
not enough
we have to upgrade them to more advanced
ones i'm sure britain will be salivating
at the prospect of getting some of them
that's what we have to do
to try to make the world as dangerous as
possible
not
in every front and meanwhile keep quiet
about it
and express our moral outrage
over the horrible crimes that an enemy
is carrying out
it's an old story
what is your view of the um
brexit project now and do you think it's
created uh
a contradiction for the conservative
party in that on the one hand its
message has always been
not always been but in recent history
has been you have to respect the market
but
brexit's in some respects marks a
departure from certain
uh western liberal norms
well
i thought all along that brexit was a
very serious error be very awful to
britain
be harmful to europe
it's a great gift to the united states
it means that britain will be compelled
to drift even further
into
subordination to the united states which
is exactly what the us wants for britain
and all of europe apart from that i
think it's a disaster
what does it mean for the conservative
party
probably nothing i imagine they can lie
their way out of it
doing a good job of that on a lot of
things and getting away with it so maybe
they can continue
probably with the help of stormer
what's uh what motivates you what keeps
you going to be this engaged in um
international affairs and media
appearances and so on obviously
tell you an anecdote
the first article i wrote
at least that i can remember
was in
fifth grade
i was 10 years old i can date it very
easily because of the time and the topic
there was an article about the fall of
barcelona
it was an article for the
elementary school newspaper
i was the editor probably the only
reader maybe my mother
the article i partly remember
it was about the fall of austria
fall of
czechoslovakia fall of toledo
now the fall of barcelona
looks like
the
grim cloud of fascism is spreading over
the whole world inexorable
well that was 9th february 1939
uh
haven't changed my opinion since
it's just gotten worse
the doomsday clock
of the bullet of atomic scientists
under trump
they abandoned minutes
moved to seconds
100 seconds to midnight that's where it
is now
because the threats are accumulating
we're approaching the most dangerous
point in human history
nothing like it before
we are now
facing the prospect
of
destruction
of organized human life on earth
from
environmental destruction
and not in the remote future
we are approaching
irreversible turning
a
point which turning points which will
not be
cannot be dealt with any longer it
doesn't mean
everybody's going to die but it's going
to mean moving to a future
in which the lucky ones will be those
who die quick more quickly
in addition to that
we are rapidly increasing the threat of
nuclear war
right at this moment
over a third of americans
say in polls
that they are willing to engage in
military action
u.s military action in ukraine
even if it's likely to need the nuclear
war
that's over a third of americans
mostly the
cohort that trump has organized who
cares
they don't know fortunately the pentagon
the last sane voice is blocking all of
this
how long the pentagon can hold out i
don't know
you have people in congress
calling
passionately
very brave for a nose-fly zone
the pentagon is telling them
look you imbeciles
if there's a no-fly zone we have to
attack russian
anti-aircraft installations inside
russia
what do you think is going to happen
then
oh we don't care we're brave and bold
uh
i
mentioned that i told yivan before one
of the
rare sane voices he
recently pointed out that
chicken hawks
like to squawk loudly
very far from where the action is
we're seeing a lot of that
in the united states and in britain
okay
we're moving
the threat of nuclear war was already
severe
before
the
putin's invasion it's no worse
the threat of
environmental destruction has gotten
much worse
with the reversal
of the limited efforts to deal with it
now moving towards rapid expansion of
fossil fuels
i simply don't understand the question
how can anybody be motivated
how can anybody not be
desperately committed
to trying to put a stop
to the end of the human experiment on
earth
that's what we're facing
we've obviously
dwelled on a lot of um
dark subjects
what is it that gives you hope
what gives me hope
a lot of young people
an england
extinction rebellion
young people
really dedicated
to trying to
put an end to the catastrophe
willing to take
serious actions
civil disobedience it's not a joke i've
been involved in it
a long time for much of my life i'm too
old for it now
but
it's not pleasant
to be maced arrested thrown in jail
beaten
[Music]
pleasanter things that you can imagine
but they're willing to undertake it to
try to stop this man race to catastrophe
there are people like them in the united
states
sunrise movement
young people who
been working hard
to try to
prevent
the disaster that their
elders are rushing towards
they reached the point of
sitting in on congressional offices
to demand some action on climate change
ordinarily they would have just been
thrown out
but not this time
because they were joined by
alexandria ocasio-cortez
young representative who came in on the
sanders wave
uh
well that meant they weren't thrown out
meant that they actually were able to
get to the point of
getting biden
to
put on his program
a climate change program which is much
better than anything proceeded
not enough but something
killed
by the republicans and
right-wing democrats
but there is still
the
ocasio-cortez marquis resolution
and they're continuing to work
lots of young people are active
not so much on the nuclear program that
seems to have faded from people's
consciousness i don't seem to understand
what a nuclear war is
a nuclear war a first
the country that carries out a first
strike
will be destroyed
by a nuclear war
simply by the effects of nuclear winter
if it's a major power
simply hasn't reached consciousness
it has among atomic scientists
and the pentagon
but not general consciousness
more things that people don't understand
and should
russia
has a very weak warning system
they rely
on old-fashioned
radar based the warning systems that
means up to the horizon
that means that a russian official has
almost no time
to react
if there's a warning
of an attack
and there are many warnings
just by accident
hundreds of them blocked by human
interference
sometimes very close
very close calls
well that got much worse
when donald trump
dismantled the
inf treaty
the gorbachev reagan inf treaty
that puts
moscow within
a couple of minutes
of
nato missiles
uh
the
but now it's with the advancement of
nato forces to the
russian border
and in placing weapons
and the
september 2021 statement that i just
read you the currently operative
statement
raises the
threat much greater
threat just of accident
the united states is much more advanced
it uses satellite-based warning systems
means it has a warning
even at the first step
of possibly
setting a melting a missile right away
the u.s knows not russia
that's the situation that
is being overlooked
by the people who do their
brave statements in congress
and in the media
well
there are to get back to your question
there are plenty of young people plenty
of them
who are appalled by the behavior
of the older generation rightly
your generation my generation they're
appalled by it
and dedicated to trying to stop this
madness before it consumes us all
well that's the hope for the future
that's a very good note to end on um so
thanks uh qg for your time today
thank you
you
