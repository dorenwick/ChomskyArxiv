those go together including his most uh
recent book dollarocracy
how money and the
media uh electoral complex are
destroying
America and um please join me in
welcoming John
Nichols very
and now it's a pleasure to welcome back
to Tucson Professor n chamski
professor
chsky professor amerus at
MIT the founding father of
linguistics
and a person that if you are in any way
involved in the behavioral sciences you
know uh who he is he is in influenced
mathematics computer science the other
languages psychology cognitive science
the author of over 100 books countless
articles
and America's foremost public
intellectual a man
who
is spreads political descent left and
right a self-described Libertarian
socialist and
Anarchist a Critic of US foreign
policy and someone who stands for
Justice Professor Nom
Chomsky wow
they we you have a slight advantage in
that well maybe a disadvantage you can
see us we can't see you as quite as well
uh but I can tell that you're all
beautiful and I also sense Your
Enthusiasm about the evening we're going
to have or the afternoon uh when the
nation magazine was thinking about the
events that we were going to do to Mark
our 150th anniversary we we knew we
wanted to do something with somebody
who' been around for at least half the
Magazine's
life and and we also knew so we were
hoping would have been right for that
whole period of time and so we were
stuck with Noom
chsky and and we also knew we didn't
want to do the event in New York or
Washington because the genius of Nom
Chomsky is that for decades he has
traveled to every corner corner of the
United States and every corner of the
world to be where activists and people
are standing up for economic and social
justice and peace and so we decided that
if there was any place that needed some
chsky it was probably
Arizona so here we are thank you to the
dean and to the school and to the
university thank you to the Tucson
Festival of books and thank you to Nome
chonky who was in South America until
yesterday just flew in from buos Aries
uh and it's a remarkable credit to this
man that he when he could maybe relax a
little he seems to be running faster and
harder than ever and I noticed when you
walked out no
uh I flashed on something that that I
think many people in the room will know
about but not everybody almost 50 years
ago you debated William F Buckley on
public television on national TV
Nationwide about issues of War and Peace
and you know the state propaganda so
many issues and uh just like this
sitting like this debating on national
television and it struck me I haven't
seen you a lot on National Television
since but
it's perhaps a good way to begin because
the fact of the matter is you are and I
don't think it's news you are America is
the world's I would argue leading public
intellectual and yet you are rarely seen
on television our main vehicle of
Communications in the United States why
is that actually um every once in a
while I'm on Fox News I
know but one of my
great Honors that I'm most proud of is
that
uh national public radio has a prime
time program All Things Considered you
know their big program in the afternoon
the U the co-host actually uh is on
record of saying I'm one of the people
he will never permit on that program
really yeah well no small accomplishment
yeah but
uh but I'll still go deeper because the
fact of the matter is as somebody who's
been involved for a long time in in
media reform efforts and efforts to to
kind of tackle the many challenges of
American Media we have an incredibly
narrow discourse in our major media in
this country and and it is a discourse
that does in fact move all sorts of
folks out to the margins and and does
that cover movements does it doesn't
cover movements doesn't cover what's
really happening a lot on the ground and
I think in many senses that disempowers
folks because they are they're never
told about what all is happening or the
ideas that are in Play There's um
actually the most interesting uh media
in my opinion are what are called the
liberal media uh they in fact most of my
own writing and discussion analysis is
about them they kind of set the limits
they say you can go this far and not a
millimeter farther and that's true
pretty much around the world
uh the uh and it of course it does cut
out U popular movements popular activism
uh very occasionally something will
break through if uh zucati Park U
finally broke through slightly with some
with actually better coverage than I
expected for a while but generally the
idea that U people might get together
organize act to change the world that's
frightening that's like uh some small
country deciding to go off on an
independent course that's quite
dangerous and and when that does happen
how does media you you mentioned
coverage of occupy and and in fact we
had a brief period I think in 2011 where
there were uh great popular uprisings in
a lot of capitals around the United
States labor movement seeming to be out
there and and how does media how does so
much of our media and our Li media shut
that down what is what's the what's the
strategy what's the tactic that you
see I think
um actually I think it was pretty well
described by George
Rell uh he U didn't say much about it
but uh everyone here I'm sure has read
animal form but probably very few people
have read the introduction to Animal
Farm the reason is it wasn't published
uh it was uh
it was discovered about 30 years later
in his unpublished papers and today if
you get a a new addition of Animal Farm
you might find it there the introduction
is kind of interesting he basically says
what you all know that uh the book is a
critical satiric analysis of the
totalitarian enemy uh but then he says
he addresses himself to the people of
free England he says you shouldn't feel
too self-righteous he said in England
free country uh I'm virtually quoting uh
unpopular ideas can be suppressed
without the use of force and he goes on
to give some examples and really just a
couple of comment sentences of
explanation which are to the point uh
one reason he says is the Press is owned
by wealthy men who have every reason not
to want certain ideas to be expressed uh
and the other he says is um he say
essentially it's a good education if you
have a good education you've gone to the
best schools you have uh internalized
the understanding that there are certain
things it just wouldn't do to say and I
think we can add to that it wouldn't do
to think and that's a powerful mechanism
so there are things you just don't think
and you don't say that's the result of a
Effective Education effective
indoctrination if people many people
don't don't uh succumb to it what
happens to them well tell you a story I
was in Sweden a couple of years ago and
uh I noticed that the taxi drivers were
being very friendly uh much more than I
expected and finally I asked one of of
them you know why why is everyone being
so nice he pulled out a t-shirt he said
every taxi driver has and the T-shirt
had a picture of me and a a quote in
Swedish of something I had said once
when I was asked what happens to people
of independent mind and I said they
become taxi
drivers man that is good
yeah see now if you could get a quote
like that for every industry yeah you'd
rule the world well this gets this gets
to a deeper question though because it's
clear in the United States today and you
see it you
travel an incredible amount around this
country and you see the movements that
are there immigrant rights black lives
matter get rid of citizens united get
money out of politics labor struggles
all all sorts of things that that that
are there so many movements and yet
not enough coalesence not something
coming together there and and I wonder
if the the lack of of that cohesive
Center that's place where people can get
their information in some sort of steady
way if that has a role in creating a
situation where we're sort of we're
compartmentalized we're
I think often neglected and disrespected
and it it has an actual political impact
it's even worse than that I've lived in
Boston for since
1950 but I go to sections of Boston for
talks and discover that there's very
significant activism going on in that
neighborhood that people don't know of
in the next neighborhood where they're
doing similar things part of the reason
is simply the absence of a labor
movement uh throughout history the labor
movement has been with all of its
defects and deficiencies and limits it's
been a kind of a center around which
things coales uh in in other countries
when I when I give talks even countries
like England uh the talks are often in
labor movement centers uh Union centers
not in the United States very rare you
can talk to um labor activists but
somewhere else in a church or in a
university the few institutions that
exist but there has been a great success
in the united the United States is to an
unusual extent a business run society
that goes way back to the early days for
all kind of reasons and the it has a
very violent and repressive labor
history uh workers were being murdered
in the United States by the hundreds at
a time time when nothing like that was
taking place in Europe or Australia or
other places and repeatedly the labor
movement has simply been crushed it's
revived again uh and when it did revive
it was a center around which
activism coalesced it had its own
journals as late as the in the late 19th
century the labor press was very Lively
active widely read uh the as late as the
1950s there were still about U maybe 800
labor journals that were reaching maybe
30 million people uh a week you know all
of that has succumbed to the uh a
massive attack of concentrated Capital
you're seeing it right now pretty
dramatically right where you live in
Wisconsin and U Scott Walker our our
great contribution to the American
political process success of right even
the rhetoric is pretty remarkable they
take the right so-called right to work
yeah law that just passed you are in a
right to work state yeah right to work
means right to scr has nothing to do
with right to work uh uh it means the
right to be represented by a union to
defend you and not to pay for it that's
right to work so it's a right to scr law
but it's not described that way and it's
not interpreted that way this is one
part of a huge the during the in the
1920s labor had been virtually crushed
one of the great um works of Labor
history is called I think something like
The Fall of the House of Labor referring
to the 1920s David Montgomery yeah uh
and visitors from uh Europe and
Australia they were shocked to see the
weakness and the of the labor movement
and its U the ability to denounce
condemn and destroy it well the 1930s it
it arose again CIO organizing a lot of
Labor activism during the second world
war the depression in the second world
war there was a real wave of radical
democracy that spread all over much of
the world including the United States
and at led to a very quick backlash uh
in many ways so for example in Europe as
uh us and British troops finally began
to enter the European continent late in
the War uh moving up through Italy the
first thing they had to do was to
disperse the anti-fascist resistance uh
to restore the traditional order
including fascist collaborators as they
reached Northern Italy they were
appalled to discover that U the labor
the LA the resistance the partisan
resistance and um the had Recon had
developed a functioning Society with uh
uh worker management worker ownership
this in was the time of the British
labor party and they were Paul to
discover that there were Enterprises
without managers and owners all of that
had to be dismissed handled uh same in
Greece uh same thing and it was a very
brutal War cost killed hundreds of
thousands of people and so on all
through Europe but the same happened
here immedi not with that much violence
but immediately after the war 1947 came
the Taft tartly act uh undermining basic
labor rights organizing rights secondary
boycotts and so on uh shortly after a
huge campaign began of corporate
propaganda which is pretty remarkable in
scale uh there pretty good scholarship
on it like Elizabeth Fone Wolf's book um
the the the concentrated Capital was uh
penetrating churches schools uh clubs of
course education educ yeah educ
education was and through it and began a
massive attack on labor well I mean the
labor
unions are not faultless in this uh
there was a
uh the radical militant element of the
labor movement was eliminated that was
the
uh under the within the context of Cold
War propaganda you know communist CIO
Union and so on yeah so they were
crushed and the labor leadership
accepted that and furthermore they
entered into a kind of class
collaboration uh the uh it's kind of
interesting to compare
the same Union in the United States and
Canada like say UAW in the United States
and Canada same Union acted quite
differently one reason why Canada has
National Health Care and the United
States doesn't is that in Canada the
labor movements militantly advocated for
National Health Care in the United
States the same unions uh militantly
advocated for good health care for
themselves
so the U Auto Workers did have decent
Health Care with a compact with
management now a compact with management
is a devil's choice because management
can decide at any time it's over and as
you recall it was pretty striking in
must have been 1979 or so the Doug
Fraser of UAW pulled out of a labor um
uh cap enter
management Cooperative enterprising that
he's discovered that capital is fighting
a one-sided class war against the labor
movement big
Discovery it took a while but by that
time it was pretty late but that that
war has really stepped up in the last
few year especially in the last few
years where we've seen you know right to
work at one time you know was Arizona
got to be right to work and and a lot of
Southern States but it didn't move north
now we have Michigan becoming a right to
work state Indiana Great Steel Center
becoming a right to work state Wisconsin
the center of American progressivism
becoming a right to work state public
sector unions being busted down losing
collective bargaining rights I mean this
is a very aggressive concentrated
initiative that's happening right now
happening right now and it goes back to
the 1940s go history but but why now so
why does it all come now well what
actually if you look at the last you
know period since second world war the
Counterattack against labor U popular
democracy U began
immediately it was held back for 20
years by a number of factors one was the
strong appeal of the New Deal measures
which a a large part of the population
strongly supported you may recall that
Eisenhower said that uh anyone who
questions the legitimacy of New Deal
programs is crazy is a nut he's a nut I
mean Eisenhower today would be way out
on the left of the political Spectrum
but uh well your buddy Howard Zin I
would occasionally say that you know in
many ways Eisenhower was a a pretty
impressive president because he didn't
send troops to the Middle East but he
did send them to Arkansas that's right
actually he did send them to the Middle
East I realized
we're going to get to the rest of the
world in a minute yeah but uh it through
the 50s and the 60s there uh there was
the remaining powerful appeal of the New
Deal measures there still was a labor
movement also these were periods a
period of very high growth uh mostly
based on the state sector of the economy
which you're not supposed to know but uh
that but but it was high growth this is
something was called the Golden Age of
American capitalism and it was
egalitarian growth so the lowest
quintile did about as well as the
highest quintile furthermore Capital was
regulated very crucial and taxed the the
wealthy were taxed wealthy were taxed
but Capital was
regulated Banks were Banks Banks were
places where you could you know put your
money in they'd lend them to somebody to
buy a car or something not like today
this system broke down in the early 70s
uh the U and that had a major effect in
fact there were there were no financial
crisis in the 50s and the 60s of course
the regulatory system was intact
internationally the Britain wood system
of regulated Capital was intact that was
dismantled in the early 70s you begin to
get what has become the global
neoliberal Assault on the global
population everywhere taking one or
another form in the United States it's
uh the form that it's taken is an
increasing attack on the general
population including the labor movement
so for example for most of the
population in the past since say mid 70s
escalating under Reagan continuing under
Clinton and on um for most of the
population real wages have stagnated or
declined for for male workers today real
wages are about what they were in
1968 there's been growth but it's going
to very few Pockets narrower and
narrower and uh this has had a striking
and dramatic effect even on things like
popular opinion so take the last couple
years you know
Obama's kind of major initiative was the
Affordable Care Act and it's interesting
to look at public attitudes towards it
and to look back at the past this is a
very heavily pulled country we know a
lot about people's attitudes uh ever
since the 1940s there's been strong
support for National Health Care know
polls depend a little bit on how the
questions act ask but it's often a large
majority very substantial as late as the
late
1980s about a majority of the population
thought that there ought to be a
constitutional guarantee for healthc
care and actually about 40% of the
population thought it was in the
Constitution that's not that long ago
well when you you get take Obama when
Obama's initiative
began uh
about almost 2third of the population
supported a public option meaning of the
various options you could choose one
would be essentially Medicare you know
public National Health Care that wasn't
even
mentioned it was wasn't even proposed
the jettied it right away along with
Single Payer which is what wepp the
other one of the strange maybe unique
features of the US Health Care system is
that the government is not permitted by
law to negotiate drug
prices uh the VA is so drug prices are
lower there the Pentagon can negotiate
um prices for paper clips let's say but
the government cannot negotiate say for
Medicare and Medicaid drug prices so of
course they're out of sight Obama never
even tried to touch this even though 85%
of the population are opposed to it now
and if you look at the following years
the propaganda has so changed people's
expressed attitudes whatever their
actual attitudes are that uh uh even the
mild reforms of the
Affordable Care Act which are some kind
of a step forward They Don't Really deal
with the problem even those are opposed
and think that in not that many years
ago like
1990 40% of the population thought there
was a constitutional guarantee for
public healthc care this is a tremendous
Triumph of
propaganda and we've created a system
now where it is so easy to flood so much
money into the communication process
citizens un did mccut and all these
decisions of the courts which whatever
minimal barriers are now down that you
know you hear the Koch brothers planning
to spend close to a billion dollars in
the next election then you find out they
spend hundreds of millions to do to do
just these things to take apart and some
of the things that have been done are
are really
sophisticated uh there's U there's an
interesting study by Suzanne metler
Cornell University sociologist called
the submerged State and what she shows
pretty convincingly is that there's been
a change from visible government
programs of Reform and um subsist and
subsidy and support where you see that
the government is doing something for
you to indirect means with where you
don't see that the government is doing
it what you see is some private entity
doing it which is being subsidized by
the government and the end result is
that people think the government is not
is harming them it's not helping them
and of course as these as this submerged
State develops turns out most of the
subsidies going to the wealthy uh so for
example the uh um the home mortgage
interest uh deduction which is a very
substantial sum of money overwhelmingly
it goes to the wealthy uh in the uh
education
the the four profit educational system
which is a big thing here uh most of it
most of the funding comes from the
taxpayer but you don't see it you know
and of course it's going to the
corporations not you and there's devices
like that all across the country the
result is that some strange results uh
people who are most subsidized by the
government tend to be most opposed to
government subsidy so it's very
striking do they not know they are
subsidized or are they just cynical you
don't know they do not know I mean who
would know that u a tax deduction for
employer uh health insurance is a huge
subsidy to the corporations or that the
home mortgage deduction is a subsidy to
the wealthy I mean you can figure it out
if you think about it but it's not
obvious on the surface
and that goes Case by case so in this
terrific new book from hey Market books
uh nom chsky masters of mankind which uh
Glenn Greenwell say on the cover Glenn
Greenwell says there is no living
political writer who has more radically
changed how more people think in more
parts of the world about political
issues than gome Chomsky which is kind
of nice
uh but
I try to you have to realize that he's a
friend and your is a friend I realize I
say nice things about him you say it
back and forth it's wonderful we are at
a Book Festival so some people are aware
of blurbs on books but yeah I have the
sense that Glenn probably means it and I
also this is a collection of essays and
one of the interesting things is for a
variety reasons my favorite one and it
was an essay that you wrote some years
ago titled consent without consent and
um I think that comes a lot of what
we're talking about with a submerged
state but also this notion that an
awfully lot of what's happening when you
assault labor when you assault so many
of the the vehicles by which people
might organize might push back it's
really an assault on Democracy itself
well democracy has democracy is a threat
to any power system doesn't matter what
it is I mean uh for pretty pretty
obvious reasons so yes there is a the
the general assault on the population
includes a major assault on democracy
and what's happened in the United States
is extremely revealing uh the U one of
the main topics in mainstream academic
polit political science is study of
comparison between public attitudes and
public policy which is a pretty
straightforward uh inquiry we see public
policy uh there's extensive polls
they're pretty reli they're consistent
over time so you get a pretty good sense
of public attitudes uh and the results
are are quite intriguing by now uh about
70% of the population is literally
disenfranchised they're the lower 70% on
the income wealth scale uh their
political Representatives simply pay no
attention to them so it doesn't matter
what they think as you move up the scale
you get a little bit more influence when
you get to the very top policies made uh
that correlates
very one of the major students of
political participation Walter Dean
Burnham years ago pointed out that if
you look at the non non- voting in the
United States is very high he said if
you look at the
non-voters and their kind of
demographics and compare it with
Europe uh they are the people who in
Europe would vote for some
labor right or Social Democratic party
but since no such thing exists here they
don't vote maybe they don't they don't
they may not need read academic
political science but they know that
nobody's paying attention to them so why
bother voting this is a plutocracy it's
not a democracy and the effects are
pretty striking there was a the last
election November 2014 was carefully
analyzed by two really fine political
scientists Ward Dean Burnham and Tom
Ferguson wrote a careful analysis of it
uh voting participation turns out that
voting participation was about at the
level of
1830 well it was also it was 36% but if
it compare it state by state but what
was interesting was it was the lowest
since
19442 it's worse than that take a look
at their analysis state by state it's
about
1830 that was a time time when voting
was restricted to property white
males and and this has been declining
and it's by now most people as they
point out just don't bother yeah it's a
Well in fact we when we flood so much
money into
politics and so much of it goes to pay
for negative ads on
television one side saying don't vote
for this guy one i' saying don't vote
for that guy a lot of people make the
logical choice and don't vote for either
and but the the interesting result on
that the interesting result on that is
that you you do have one entity that
comes out getting really rich by this
politics that drives so many of the
people away and that is the the big
broadcast companies they make a fortune
they do and uh but not in any way I
think advancing democracy well but I
think we we should I mean what's
happening now is indeed extreme but we
we should remember that goes way back
way back you remember about a century
ago Mark Hannah the great campaign
manager was asked U what do you really
need to run an effective campaign he
said there are three things the first
one is money second one is money and and
the third he said I can't
remember that was around 1900 yeah and
but but there was sort of some
interventions between 1900 and now we
sort of tried to address some of those
problem changes and now we are now we're
going back in fact it's worse than it
was probably ever is it now that's an
important thing we should do you think
that it is worse that we are maybe at
the worst point now is it or are there
when we look through the history of this
country well it's it's a mixed story
because there is plenty of political
activism and in fact if you look at
people's attitudes closely they tend to
be pretty Social Democratic uh even uh
you know there have been studies of
people the subclass of people who say
you know get the government off my back
I don't want to have government and so
on you take a look at them what they
want is more spending on health care
more spending on education higher taxes
on the wealthy uh a range of positions
which you and I would probably agree
with but they're the ones who say
they're that get the government off our
back we don't want any government
government messing with my medicare yeah
don't mess with my medicare that kind of
thing hey we have this uh we've got this
wonderful group of folks that they are
actually uh un graduates of this
University who started a little company
here to
democratize how we do Q&A how we we
actually talk good and um it's I know
how it works yeah the amount of money
you put in determines yeah yeah yeah
yeah no no no it's
actually that that's the next
application these guys they call it two
shoes app and it's um as in goodie two
shoes like the person who raises their
hand and they they they actually created
something that you featured it on your
Facebook site or someplace where I know
somebody I don't have a somebody who
does something some place somebody puts
chsky on it yeah uh it's like the person
who made the t-shirt in Sweden um they
they asked you what what we could ask
you and uh the two shoes app f came up
with all these and it was very
interesting that a lot of the questions
the hopeful questions actually focused
on things going on outside the United
States which I find frustrating because
I do believe there's a lot of great
activism here but there was there
questions especially about Greece and
Spain and particularly about the rise of
sesa and the rise of pamos both
political parties that did not exist or
political groupings that did not exist
but in Greece have now risen to being
the governing party and potentially in
Spain could do so you've been watching
these closely and I'm very interested
first off your general Impressions and
many people ask questions about this but
also your sense of why they are coming
together and functioning politically in
something happening that we are still
waiting for in the
US actually I've just been at an
International Conference
in buen Aries that's where it was
yesterday of an international Forum of
on emancipation and inequality where it
drew groups like this from all over the
world pamas activists and Leaders with
their serious activists and so on and
you were very impressed by the p uh
they're pretty impressive yeah and but
we have to remember what's been
happening in Europe Europe has had um
one of the great successes of Europe in
the postc World War era has been to
construct a mo reasonably well
functioned
in Social Democratic welfare state
Society a lot of problems but but by
comparative standards pretty successful
dur the nightmarish circumstance of
Norway oh that's a yeah but all over the
continent yeah and of course the
business classes hate it you know and uh
Europe has been subjected to an extreme
form of punishment in the past few years
years it's which is an attack on
Democracy an attack on living standards
and an effort to undermine and dismantle
this achievement and it's pretty it's
the the policies that have been followed
are uh policies of austerity during
recession which even the IMF the
international monetary fund says is
economically ridiculous but it's it may
be economically ridiculous but it's
politically and socially sensible it's
from the point of view from the point of
view of class war it is slowly achieving
a result which has long been uh hoped
for by the ruling sections by the
dominant sections of capital but it's
very severe and it's been worst the
worst hit have been the peripheral
countries Greece Spain Spain Portugal
Ireland what's actually happened is that
the uh the banks you know the northern
Banks the German banks and so on made
very U risky uh loans to countries which
were unable to sustain them uh but when
the crash came and they couldn't pay
them back uh the big Banks like other C
sectors of capital don't believe in
capitalism if you in a capitalist system
it say if I lend you money and I know
that you're a a risky borrower so I put
you are I put heavy conditions on it I
make a lot of profit and then you can't
pay in a capitalist system it's my
problem yeah but not the way the world
works well that would never happen in
the US the banks would never get bailed
out here in fact come to that in a
moment but what's but the the response
of the so-call troa the European
commission you know the bank and so on
have and the IMF have been to pay back
the culprits pay the bankers so when
there's money given to Greece what's
called money to Greece means give it
back to the banks that lent money to
Greece and want to be repaid very anti
capitalist the same thing happens here
so take say the big Banks here there was
recently a study of the by the IMF of
the profits of the big banks in the
United States States turns out that they
make virtually no profit their profit
almost entirely depends on the implicit
government insurance
policy the business press estimates that
at over $80 billion a year you can argue
about the numbers but it's very high
it's not just the bailouts that's a
small part of it it's a higher cred
inflated credit ratings access to cheap
money the ability to make risk loans
which are profitable knowing you're
going to be bailed out uh all of that
amounts to quite a lot same in Europe uh
and alongside of this is an attack on
Democracy so extreme that even the Wall
Street Journal commented that correctly
that no matter who's elected in a
European country
Communists right-wing whatever it may be
policies are the same because policies
are made by the Brussels bureaucrats and
the bundes bankk doesn't matter what the
public wants and those policies are cut
the
pensions neoliberal attack during
periods of recession attack trade unions
attack the the whole list the whole list
and
uh sometimes it's pretty dramatic so
right now for example sesa and Greece
hinted that they might undertake a
referendum the roof fell in on them how
dare you ask the public about policies
that they're being subjected to that
this happened a couple of years ago when
uh Pap andreo prime minister suggested
mildly that maybe there should be a
referendum in Greece to see if they
should accept these extremely harsh and
Savage policies that are being imposed
again across the Spectrum he was
bitterly denounced he had to back off
this idea that the public should be
asked about the what the policies that
are being imposed on them is considered
outrageous policies have to be made by
the the Brussels bureaucrats and the big
Banks that's a major attack on Democracy
Now in reaction to this there have been
popular Uprising podemos the party in
Spain is just a couple years old but the
indignados the uh activism of young
people in many ways something not
exactly because a different country but
in many ways something we might see as
parallel to what we saw with occupy
occupy very much so that um it went on
occupy became a it went on in in Spain
to everyone's surprised nobody could
have predicted this three or four years
ago but out of it came a political
organization which is now running ahead
in the polls could take over uh siresa
and Greece is pretty similar in fact
they did did take political power but
you couldn't have predicted it a couple
of years ago and there's a very
U kind of challenging and in a way
frightening situation if pemus sesa and
similar organizations fail the likely
outcome is popular movements of the far
right yes that's happened
before late 20s early 30s we're seeing
something similar if the organized left
doesn't succeed in taking control we may
very well get the organized right with
horrible consequences which we've seen
before well the Great British
parliamentarian Tony Ben said that he
was old enough to remember when
countries around the world were
essentially making the choice and at
exactly the same time yeah some going
toward fascism some going toward a
progressive democracy they all had the
choice it was the same in all of them
and depended who won and and and in
obviously in Greece that's a reality
because there is a far right that is
very fascist that has certain Spain to
France England for example and and yet
so many of our political leaders in
America seem to
be at the very least
disinterested or you know at least
publicly pay plenty of attention I know
they are yeah but they're not we we hear
very little discourse about this among
our political figures because it's
dangerous to talk about it you don't
want people to know that it is possible
for the population to become organized
active effective take power take control
of their fate uh and and create a
different Society for example you don't
hear in the United States about the fact
that in Spain there's a major
conglomerate which is worker owned and
which in fact survived the recession
mandron yeah which includes uh uh in
manufacturing Bank uh Finance Health uh
housing
uh it's a huge and effective
conglomerate worker worker owned uh
directors picked by the workers and
working quite well you don't see
headlines about that not at all and and
yet in very Cutting Edge they're
actually ahead of the curve on on
developing new technologies developing
new Industries and you also don't see
much about the fact that something
similar is happening here here not on
that scale but uh garl peritz is one
person who's written about it in areas
of the old Rust Belt as you know
Cleveland and other cities yeah we're in
Northern Ohio other places there's the
beginnings of development of worker own
Enterprises which are not not on the
mandron scale but not insubstantial
either and and incidentally they also
get conservative support what's that
they even get conservative support well
and one of the things one of the things
that that it struck me got remarkably
little attention in the United States
was when the bankers crashed the economy
of
Iceland tiny little country and then
they they basically they cut a deal that
Iceland's going to pay back the banks
and then because it was a small enough
country the people went to the
president's house and said we don't want
to do this and and they basically forced
a referendum on the issue and amazingly
enough iand voted not to pay back the
banks and what's more they did pretty
well and they've come out okay yeah the
U the British and infuriated but it
worked well yeah is it's an in fact
something similar happened in Argentina
around 2000 they essentially defaulted
on the debt and the economists and the
uh governments around the world said
this is you're going to be destroy
yourselves they practically the highest
growth rate in uh Latin America since
then they're now under attack by us
vulture funds backed by the judicial
system which is very may may really
undermine them actually the
uh the judge in the United States judge
grea who made the
ruling is requiring demanded that
Argentina pay back the vulture funds uh
without the so-called haircut the the
cutting back
of profit that they demanded and he's
now insisting that institution like say
City Bank not B deal with Argentine
bonds because they'd be in violation of
his order they'll be in violation of
Argentine law if they don't do it and
they're caught in the midst of this
conflict between the US vulture funds
backed so far by the US Judiciary and a
country which uh correctly uh didn't pay
back the money notice that these debts
are really not legitimate debts these
are what are called in odious debts
that's a concept was invented by the
United States actually when the United
States uh uh took over Cuba in
1898 it did not want to pay Cuba's debts
to Spain and the US argued quite
correctly that these debts were
illegitimate odas they were called the
people of Cuba had not incurred the debt
so why should they be forced to pay it
but that's true of debt all over the
world MH the people don't incur the debt
the rulers do why should the population
pay that's
uh and we actually we look at the
questions people have submitted we have
quite a few questions in this range or
in this area and and there is again and
again people come back to this this
question of how do we get how do we get
folks focused on that and Naomi kleene
wrote a
book this changes everything uh arguing
that that perhaps you know torching the
planet might get people
interested um other folks have suggested
we have some number of questions on this
other folks have suggested that the
decline of work the fact that we are
replacing people with robots and apps
and it's harder and harder to find
meaningful work or at least work of a
decent pay um that there may be issues
that bring us together what's your sense
on this is there something that that be
it climate change be it some sort of
economic shift that does that could in
the United States spark a mobilization a
change well you know prediction in human
Affairs is a a very low probability I
realize see I read I read chomsky's old
essays for that yeah for good reasons I
mean an awful lot depends just on will
and choice yeah and we don't know nobody
knows uh pus for example you couldn't
have predicted the New Deal CIO
organizing in the 1930s you couldn't
have predicted the United States could
have gone towards fasion could have uh
these are questions of people's choice
and decisions now take Naomi Klein's
Point whether she's going to be right or
wrong we don't know but if she's wrong
we're doomed well there's a tough part
and uh we are coming towards a precipice
unless you've been living under a rock
you know that uh the threat of
environmental catastrophe is quite real
and not in the very distant
future uh maybe the next Generation
could be extremely serious we also can
see that the race towards disaster is
being carried out with almost euphoric
intensity take a look at this morning's
Wall Street Journal lead article top
article is about how uh the oil the
energy corporations in the US are uh fac
there there's an oil glut at the moment
and they're preparing right now that if
uh
oil this decline lines they'll
immediately put into motion U
Enterprises they've already established
which will greatly increase the flow of
oil in other words drive us farther
toward the precipice we're racing
towards this and and what Naomi Klein is
pointing out is uh we'd better organize
to stop it or else uh the prospects for
decent existence are going to disappear
now will it work or won't it well that's
matter of Will and choice these folks
got to decide and take the question of
work yeah it it's an interesting
question take look around the country
this country is falling apart when you
come back even when you come back from
Argentina to the United States it looks
like a third world country when you come
back from Europe even more so the
infrastructure is collapsing nothing
works transportation system doesn't work
the health system is a total Scandal
twice the per capita cost cost of other
countries and not very good outcomes
Point by point the schools are declining
they don't have enough teachers there's
a huge amount of work to be done there
are plenty of Idle Hands who want to do
it there's ample resources but the
system is so corrupt that it cannot put
together massive resources Idle Hands
and needed
work that can be overcome
I mean the the extent of this is really
astonishing so it takes a
transportation now you can take a
high-speed train from Beijing to
Kazakhstan you can't take one from
Boston to New York that's the most the
most heavily traveled Corridor I suppose
in the world is Boston to Washington
it's about the way it was 60 years ago
the first time I took a train from New
York Philadelphia to Boston
1950 uh I think if I take the asella the
fast train today I think it's maybe 15
minutes faster it's as it goes along the
Connecticut turnpike it's not keeping up
with the cars uh literally I mean a
couple of years ago I was in I was
giving talks in Europe I ended up in
southern France and I had to take a
train from Aenon southern France to the
deal airport in Paris there happens to
be a direct train not surprisingly uh it
took it's about the distance from
Washington to Boston it took two hours
Boston to Washington is like seven hours
uh and this is just symptomatic of
what's happening to the country I'm sure
an election between Hillary Clinton and
Jeb Bush would sort this all out oh
right
right well they have private jets
doesn't matter they have private jets
doesn't matter I you you are a and
there's so many things to to bring in
here and and discuss we've been bouncing
a little bit on on the rest of the world
before we come back into US politics for
a second I I would be remiss if I didn't
note that on Tuesday Israel is going to
have an
election and uh the prime minister of
Israel recently visited the United
States uh to give our Congress some
advice
um which intriguingly enough if you read
the polls may not have helped him in
Israel in fact uh but give us a sense of
the as we look at the Netanyahu visit
and then also the play out with our 47
Republican Senators who have just
decided to become
diplomats actually there was an
interesting article on the U Netanyahu
speech to Congress by urri ofner he's
one of the one of the great in Israel
really fine Israeli intellectuals and
activists older than me and he started
believe it or not he's still old he he
started the article by saying that when
he was watching Netanyahu in Congress it
reminded him of something and he had to
think what it was reminding of finally
it dawned on him it was Hitler speeches
to the RTO he said all that was missing
was KY
you and it was quite
a it was quite a performance it was a
really really demeaning performance and
it's a combination of a number of
factors one factor is uh just as you
mentioned before money a ton of money
goes into funding
U congressmen who will support the
latest uh APAC line another part is
evangelical Christians there's the base
of the a large part of the base of the
Republican party now these are
Republicans mostly is evangelical
Christians who succeed in
combining almost extreme support for
Israel with extreme
anti-Semitism it's an interesting
combination I mean if you look at their
theology Theology of a large number of
them the idea is that uh there'll be a
great war between Israel and its enemies
it'll end up at Armageddon everyone will
kill each other the uh saved Souls will
rise to heaven the rest go to Eternal
damnation which includes virtually all
the Jews 160,000 for some reason will be
saved they will have found Christ in
time now you can't get more anti-semitic
than that even Hitler didn't go that far
but this this is combined with
uh what's called support for Israel to
such an extreme extent that the Israeli
government has has to try to control it
they have to try to prevent people from
blowing up the Temple Mount you know to
create the war which will uh lead the
Armageddon and this is pretty Broad in
the United States actually something
like that even
included President Bush second President
Bush as perhaps you know when uh when
Bush was trying to gain international
support for the invasion of Iraq uh he
met the French president Shak and uh uh
he U well I I'll tell you how I learned
about this and then tell you what the
story is around that time I got a letter
from a Belgian Theologian who sent me a
disquisition that he wrote on a very
obscure passage in the Book of Ezekiel
about the uh go and Magog coming and
doing terrible things to Israel nobody
knows what it means are they people are
they places it's just a very obscure
passage but in EV an a a stream of
Evangelical theology this means an evil
force will come from the north attack
Israel lead to Armageddon then all these
things happen well what happened with
bush and Shirak Bush apparently started
this is January 2003 right before the
War uh telling he went off and started
talking to sharak about Goan MOG sh
didn't know what the heck he was talking
about so he asked the U Eliz the French
Foreign office what's this guy raving
about they didn't know so they contacted
this Belgian Theologian who explained
them what it's
about I learned about this at the time
but I didn't believe a word of it so I
never wrote about it but I did mention
it to an
Australian academic researcher Clive
Hamilton and he looked into it and it's
true it it shows up in the French
biographies of shurak well this this
tells us that you know speaking of the
dangers we Face Our Fate is sometimes in
the hands of people who
are by any rational standards hard to
believe and it's not the only case
actually Reagan talked about Russia as
Goen [ __ ] well we we may uh we seem to
be having a little trouble in our
relations with Russia right now serious
trouble yeah and it's uh it's a complex
story goes back to
1990 when the round then when the Soviet
Union collapsed there was
a an agreement made between Mel
Gorbachev Russian leader and George Bush
the first the the first heor Bush the
greater versus George Bush the lesser
the Statesman like Bush the first you
they agree gorbachov agreed to allow
Germany to be
reunited and to join NATO hostile
military Alliance it's quite a
concession if you look at the history of
the preceding history of the century
Germany alone had practically destroyed
Russia several times and he was agreeing
to allow United Germany to join a
hostile military Alliance there was a
quid
proquo the this would the it was the
phrase that was used was that NATO would
not expand one inch to the east which
meant East Germany that was the
agreement NATO immediately expanded East
Germany gorbachov complained naturally
and he was informed that this was only a
verbal agreement it wasn't on paper the
unstated implication I'll add it not
them is if you're naive enough to make a
gentleman's agreement with us it's your
problem not not ours not ours Clinton
came along expanded NATO further right
to the borders of Russia uh the uh
current issue over Ukraine is in a
region
of enormous geostrategic significance to
Russia it's right at the heart of
Russian concerns any Russian leader
would not accept uh Ukraine joining NATO
even joining the European Union is
problematic for them it's it's kind of
like Mexico joining the Warsaw PCT in
the in the 1970s or 1980s you
know we' we'd have a nuclear war to
block that uh and in fact the new Europe
Ukrainian government the one that came
in after the coup has voted the
parliament voted overwhelmingly
something like 300 10 or something to
join to take steps toward joining NATO
that's a serious threat to Russia I mean
whatever you think about Russian actions
think you know however horrible you
believe them this is a real strategic
threat now there's a
solution and everyone knows what it is
declare Ukrainian neutral
neutrality Ukraine should be neutral not
part of any military Alliance uh there's
has to be a settlement about autonomy
and which is not a trivial issue uh but
can be solved that could that could
prevent what could be escalation up to
the level of nuclear war it's very
serious it doesn't take much to set off
a war small things can set off a war we
know that look back one century and you
see an example but there plenty of them
since this is really playing with fire
and it makes no sense to press a nuclear
armed state to the Limit where it might
react
violently
that's you know that's saying let's
commit suicide it literally is I it's
been known for a long time that there is
absolutely no escape from nuclear war
none you cannot have a limited nuclear
war among major Powers uh back in 1962
at the time of the Missile Crisis which
came very close there were war games run
in Washington they all showed that any
limited war is going to explode to a
total war
is do you have any and we had a couple
questions do you have any optimism as
regards the uh us negotiations with Iran
as regards nuclear power or nuclear
weapons this is an interesting it's
interesting the way it's discussed here
first of all the standard line is the
International Community demands that
Iran give up its nuclear programs who's
the International
Community well the term International
Community again comes straight out of
Orwell it means the United States and
whoever happens to agree with it that's
the International Community uh what
about the
world I mean there happens to be a world
out there you know this is a pretty
insular country but you can't deny its
existence uh the the non-aligned
countries g77 they're called the old
non-aligned countries that's large
majority of the world's population they
had their regular meeting in Taron a
couple of years ago and they once again
vigorously supported Iran's right to
develop
nuclear power as a signer of the
nonproliferation
treaty well why shouldn't they have that
right now in the United States the
standard line about Iran is it's the
greatest threat to World Peace as
Netanyahu said it's aggressive violent
wants to conquer the world and so on you
know a lot of things wrong with Iran you
know not my favorite place by any means
but is it aggressive which where is
aggressive taking place there are
actually two countries that are very
aggressive in that region one of course
is the United States carrying out
aggression all the time the other is
Israel which has invaded Lebanon five
times is occupying you know and uh what
is what is the actual concern about and
of course Israel has a huge nuclear
weapons uh capacity probably hundreds of
nuclear weapons what what is the actual
concern about Iranian nuclear
weapons the standard talk is well if
Iran has nuclear weapons it's going to
destroy Israel it's going to attack the
United States it's going to conquer the
world I mean anyone with a gray cell
functioning including every intelligence
agency knows that if Iran had nuclear
weapons and even tried to load a missile
country' be
vaporized you know period And whatever
you think about the ruling clerics
they've given no indication of being
suicidal of wanting to lose everything
they have actually us intelligence has
explained publicly the threat of Iranian
nuclear weapons publicly there regular
reports to Congress on the Global
Security situation it's all public what
they've pointed out is that uh Iran's
strategic Doctrine is
defensive for understandable reasons if
you look at the surround they have low
military expenditures even by standards
of the region and their strategic
Doctrine is TR to try to prevent an
attack long enough for diplomacy to
begin to operate they add that if Iran
is attempting to develop nuclear weapons
which no one knows it would be part of
their deterrence
strategy now the United States and
Israel cannot tolerate a
deterrent if there's a deterrent you
cannot use force and violence freely I
think that's the heart of the matter is
there a solution to this yeah several
possible solutions so for example in
couple of years ago
2010 uh there was an agreement reached
between uh Iran turkey and Brazil
in which under which Iran would transfer
its low-enriched uranium to Turkey and
in return the Western Powers would
provide the radioactive isotopes for for
Iran's uh uh medical reactors and so on
that agreement as soon as that agreement
was reached there was a bitter attack
here by the government and the press
against Brazil and turkey
for for implementing this agreement the
foreign minister of Brazil was kind of
upset about it and he released a letter
from President Obama to the president of
Brazil proposing this presumably because
they assumed Iran would never accept and
it would be a propaganda weapon well
they accept it what do we do we bitterly
denounce them for breaking ranks
accepting so on and there were all kind
of pretexts offered but they didn't
amount to much a couple of years later
2012 December
2012 there was to be a meeting in
Helsinki to to carry forward a program
that was initiated by the Arab states in
the early 90s to try to impose a nuclear
weapons free zone in the region there's
enormous international support for that
support so strong that the United States
England and others kind of formally
agree but they say you know not right
now uh this uh meeting was an attempt to
carry it forward it's under un
opes uh Israel said they wouldn't attend
the meeting the next question is what's
Iran going to do Iran said it would
attend the meeting without
preconditions couple days later Obama
canel the meetings
this was barely even mentioned in the US
press try to find it uh the meetings did
go on but uh only with non-governmental
organizations if the US is not going to
take part nothing is going to happen
well this might or might not work but it
might work that's the point now why is
the US opposed to it because Israel
would have to give up its nuclear
weapons and us is not willing to agree
to that but but that these are possible
answers to a manufactured
crisis again it's not that Iran is a
nice place you know lot of things wrong
there although incidentally by the
standards of our allies it's pretty
regressive compared with say Saudi
Arabia it looks like a free and open
Society uh but uh so so this is by no
means supportive of Iran's clerical
quazi dictatorship but it but the fact
of the matter is that uh there are
potential Solutions which are within
reach but are not being discussed and
the reason I think goes back to what the
US intelligence reports the US and
Israel are unwilling to accept the
possibility it's a remote possibility
but some possibility of a deterrent the
chances are if you try to guess what
Iran's probably trying to do we of
course don't know but the the chances
are that they're probably trying to
develop uh what's sometimes called
nuclear capability that is the
capability to produce nuclear weapons if
they decide to do it there are many
countries in the world that have that
capability and conceivably not
implausibly they may be trying to do the
same thing it wouldn't be surprising if
you look at the region the surrounded by
nuclear weapon States the United States
of course Israel Pakistan India they're
they're an environment of extreme threat
and the conflicts with Iran now are
reaching a level which is almost surreal
take a look at Iraq the United States
its main enemy in Iraq is supposed to be
Isis who's fighting Isis Iran you know
Iran is backing the government of Iraq
it's providing the military support the
train in the arms and so on to U try to
press Isis out of its recent conquests
in fact the Iraqi military the Iraqi
leadership is saying openly thanking
Iran and saying the US isn't helping us
well if you really want to eliminate
Isis you're going to cooperate with the
people who are doing it Iran is the one
state that's doing it there's also U
fighters on the ground who happen to be
on the US terrorist list the pkk the uh
Kurdish
based these these Patrick Coburn one of
the fabulous very correspond yeah what
he's pointed out is that uh US policy
says come straight out of Alison
Wonderland we're refusing to cooperate
with the people who are fighting our
enemy and in fact we're attacking them
well you've you've spent the better part
of 60 years now suggesting US policy
head of Allison one Wonderland component
to it and as we circle around here and
and I think probably most people in the
room would would love it if we sat up
here for another three or four hours but
you have you've just flown all the way
from South America to be with us so
we're we're over our time limit but I
did want to ask you you've been so
consistent and very consistent for a
very very long time in your assessment
of a whole host of of domestic and and
international issues and if I'm right
about it because I interviewed you some
years ago about this a lot of it Roots
back to your your Youth and you used to
hang out at your uncle's news stand your
your political education came in New
York City at a news where I'm sure the
nation was prominently displayed 72nd
and Broadway 72nd and Broadway but this
was this is tell us about about where
this started well I was a kid I was
you're about 10 11 11 12 years old but
uh one of the first things I learned at
the news stand is that there's a
newspaper in New York which you probably
never heard of it's called The N
mirror and the way I knew that is that
when people came it was at a subway
station when people came out of the
subway station racing out they asked for
the N mirror and I handed them two
tabloids later I discovered it's two
newspapers the news and the
mirror but I also this is the beginning
of your study of linguistics beginning
of my political education the next part
was to notice that as they took the nen
mirror first thing they did is opened
the racing forms so I got some insight
into society but the fact of the matter
is that there were U my uncle was a very
interesting he'd never gone past fourth
grade but very Ed self-educated very
intelligent very perceptive person long
story but he attracted around the news
stand uh igra who were this was the late
30s early 40s who were coming from
Europe you know so German psychiatrists
other people there were interesting
discussions going on which as a child I
listened to Meanwhile at the same time I
was hanging out in uh U Anarchist
offices
and Union Square bookstores and fourth
Aven yish newspapers no long yeah yeah
FR ARA was there and there were there
were again refugees coming a lot of them
Spanish refugees Spanish anarchists and
I I learned a lot from that that's one
part of my education you've been pretty
consistent on keeping a lot of those
values alive in our discourse at a time
where to suggest that you might be a
Libertarian socialist is not necessarily
uh something that every major reporter
understands uh libertarian socialism is
just the traditional name for anarchism
left left-wing anarchism the United
States the term libertarian in the
United States has a different meaning
than it had in traditionally very
different meaning it's very
anti-libertarian you're telling me Rand
Paul is not uh not really put it all
together you take a look at American
style libertarianism it's basically
advoc advocacy of private
tyranny the not that the people say
it or even believe
but if you think about the policies
that's what it ends up
being and the number one question the
people asked and it actually it is it's
genuinely Democratic they get to vote
and they vote a question up the ladder
and so far there's no campaign
advertising so it's reasonably legit I
think the number one question they asked
you they they all know you they well
there was actually somebody asked whe
whether you had a favorite uh having
grown up in Philadelphia whether you had
a favorite Philly cheese steak uh
but the number one question was gome
you've been at this political commentary
for a very long time have you ever
gotten anything wrong in your
interpretation uh and if so have you
ever publicly admitted as much and a
somewhat related
question what are the two most important
subjects that you have changed your mind
on and what prompted you to do so pretty
long question but it's an interesting
plenty of mistakes the usual mistake
which happens over and over is getting
involved in things too
late it's a serious mistake so it take
say what we were talking about before
global warming time to get involved in
that was the 1970s MH uh by the 1970s it
was already I remember very well when
the two friends one who was head of
Earth Sciences at Harvard the other head
of meteorology at MIT both around the
same time came with very gloomy
countenances they were getting
information indicating that the effect
of
uh anthrop human contributions to carbon
dioxide uh concentrations in the
atmosphere were reaching severe
proportions I didn't do anything very
few people did anything it wasn't until
years later that uh I and others became
seriously involved at the point when
it's a real crisis all right that's a
bad mistake the same as true of the
Vietnam War for example I was very much
involved in anti-war activism but and
resistance and so on but from the early
60s and the time to become involved was
1950 that's when the policies were set
that led to this destruction uh I could
go over case after case uh the general
error
at least my own when I look back is just
not getting involved sufficiently when
it matters is that the underpinning of
your great essay on the responsibility
of a of an
intellectual do you know where that talk
was that was like most of my articles
that was a talk it'll surprise you to
find out where it was given to the
Harvard Hillel
Association this is before 1967 when
everything changed MH
so much has changed but for so many
years you have been a remarkable voice
and one that that people have many
people have disagreed with you you never
seem to mind it when people disagree
with you you like the debate you like
the argument well often they're
right but also many people have learned
to look at
media politics economics and Society in
fundamentally different ways and as a
person who's been involved in media
reform for an awfully long time I can
tell you that a month ago when the media
Reform movement in this country
succeeded in getting the FCC the Federal
Communications Commission to protect net
neutrality and to protect the internet
of
solid I think an awfully lot of them I I
believe almost every activist who came
to every rally was carrying a copy of
manufacturing consent ladies and
gentlemen no I'm chsky thank you
