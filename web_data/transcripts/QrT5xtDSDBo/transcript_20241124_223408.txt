well first off thank you so much for
conducting this interview and for your
many years of continued activism and
solidarity over the past few years
there's been a re-evaluation of violent
revolutionary practice by some
intellectuals on the left what is your
position on the role of violence in this
case subjective violence as opposed to
symbolic or objective violence in
movements of
Liberation well first of all I'm not
familiar with the Revival and I don't
know exactly what's being advoc ated but
U is what being advocated that we pick
up our guns and overthrow the government
or well basically some some some
theorists have said that we should
really look at um the ethical
implications of violence through the
lens of for example the terror in France
and that it was justified what was done
uh during that time period maybe it was
done maybe it was not done but it was
done by a government after the the
government was established and it uh
carried out a terror campaign basically
against adversaries is that the
situation we're
in some would say we are in you know
dangerous times with you know well maybe
in dangerous times but are you and I
part of a revolutionary government that
controls the armed forces and is uh
confronted with the oppositionists who
were trying to eliminate we're not in
that position of course at this so then
that analogy is irrelevant okay so what
is relevant the question would be is is
violent practice uh Justified for us to
overthrow a government so again should
we take our guns our guns go out in the
street and uh start
destroying Chase Manhattan bank and uh
well if you want to get killed in five
minutes that's a good
suggestion other than that it has abut
nothing to do with the world so there's
not even any point to discussing I I
think it's a crazy idea myself but and
but that quite apart from that it's like
asking should we uh climb on an asteroid
and attack the Earth okay maybe I don't
think it's a good idea but why talk
about it so you think this sort of like
20th century revolutionary movements uh
it's not just 20th century I mean
uh a very rare occasions when you can
even raise the question right and we're
not anywhere near those occasions right
if you want to raise the question about
some abstra and some philosophy seminar
okay can discuss it so we can discuss
are there circumstances in which it
might be justified to take up arms to
overthrow a uh a repressive government
yeah sure for example I was in favor of
U um the conspirators who tried to kill
Hitler I think that was a good thing to
do I was in favor of the partisans who
were resisting the Nazis uh I think you
give many cases in which resistance to
oppression and uh Terror and violence is
Justified I'm not a pure pacifist so I
can imagine however I think
uh it takes it carries a very heavy
burden of proof I mean the burden of
proof is always on those who choose
violence sometimes the burden can be met
in my opinion but it's a heavy heavy
burden and as I say now we're in a
philosophy seminar unrelated to the real
world right okay but if we're talking
about the real world which is what I
happen to care about uh I don't see much
Point discussing it so I don't know what
the Revival is that you're talking about
right there's uh in conjunction there's
just been a A Renewed interest for
example in uh the Jacobin Legacy there's
been a lot of new writings on and
re-evaluating the terror in defense of
the terror uh justifying the terror
justifying robes Pierre and his vision
of a a New France um a revolutionary
France a a sort of a secular France that
was cut from what had happened
previously in history and so this is
something of course that is promulgated
by some in the left who have still
connections with um maybe 20th century
communist experiments this sort of
leninist uh vanguardism that came about
and and what do you think is is the is
the Legacy that we still face in the
left of for example jacobinism leninism
these sort of things well they're quite
different first of all in the case of
jacobinism we could discuss it but
that's now we're back in a philosophy
seminar an interesting one at this time
unlike the other one which was not
interesting so there's a an interesting
question as to what should have been
what were the prop prop proper actions
to have been taken in Revolutionary
France I don't happen to agree with
roeser's Methods at all but we could
discuss it interesting historical
discussion well let's move to leninism a
totally unrelated no relation whatsoever
uh leninism was uh in my view
counterrevolutionary it wasn't
instituting communism uh there was a
popular revolution in fact there had
been for years years and in through the
1917 it grew very substantially from
February on lenon basically tried to
take control of it uh he if you take a
look at his writings in 1917 they went
way to the left April thesis State and
Revolution the most radical things he
ever
wrote almost Anarchist and my view and
is it was basically opportunism I don't
think he beli the word of it seems he
was trying to associate himself become
the leader of the
Revolutionary popular forces and when he
became the leader he didn't waste much
time and trosy helped him in instituting
a a pretty repressive
regime uh with not wasn't Stalin but all
of the basic elements of
stalinism uh they moved pretty quickly
to dismantle most of the organs of
popular power not overnight but over not
very long time they were able to
basically dismantle the Soviets the
factory councils to convert the labor of
course the peasant revolutionary forces
they were very much opposed to this
incidentally as distinct from Marx Marx
saw revolutionary potential in the
Russian peasantry the urban Communists
like and were strongly opposed to that
in fact a lot of Marx's latest later
work was even suppressed because they
didn't like what he was saying but uh so
it wasn't marks but they had contempt
for the backward peasants their
conception was Russia is a backward
peasant Society it has to be driven to
industrialization and then out of that U
you know the iron laws of History will
lead to social socialism and so on but
sometime in the future and in fact they
regarded Russia as a backwat they were
essentially waiting for a revolution in
Germany the most advanced capitalist
country that's where there should be a
revolution when the Revolution was
crushed in Germany in 1919 by that
time Russia had been pretty much turned
into the kind of Labor Army that lenon
and trosy were advocating not totally
but mostly crunch that kind of finished
it off but when the uh German Revolution
was crushed they realized that's not
going to work uh so we have to do
something else to drive Russia towards
industrialization and shortly after that
comes the New Economic Policy which is
essentially let's introduce State
capitalism but with an iron fist uh
because we're going to drive them
forward and this is Lenin's vanguardism
it was sharply criticized back in the
early years of the 20th century by
marxists MH in fact his later some of
his later Associates and although some
of the critics like Rosen
Luxenberg pointed out that Lenin's
program which they regarded as pretty
right-wing and I do too was uh well the
image was that uh the uh there'll be a
proletarian Revolution the party will
take over from the proletariat the
Central Committee will take over from
the party and uh the maximal leader will
take over from the Central Committee
yeah pretty much what happened you know
not precisely but that's roughly what
happened uh and after that the use of
Terror to defend the repressive violent
state has nothing to do with Communism
in fact I think this is one of the great
blows to socialism in the 20th century
was the Bic Revolution I mean it called
itself socialist and the West called it
socialist in fact that's one thing on
which the world's two major propaganda
systems agree
the huge propaganda system in the west
and the minor propaganda system in the
East and one of the few things on which
they agreed was that this was socialism
the West propaganda system liked that
because it's a way of defaming socialism
right relating it to the um what's going
on in Russia and uh the East
the the Russian propaganda system liked
it because they're trying to profit from
the moral Aura of socialism which was
quite real so they kind of both agreed
on that and you know when the world's
major propaganda systems agree on
something it's kind of hard for people
to extricate themselves from it so by
now it's a routine that that was
socialism although it had it was very
antisocial I remember when by late 80s
when it was Prett clear the system was
tottering I was asked by a left Journal
I won't mention it to write an article
on what I thought was going to happen
when the system collapses and I wrote an
article in which I said I think it'll be
a small victory for socialism if the
system collapses they refused to publish
it I finally it was published in an
anarchist magazine so that's so it
appeared but because they couldn't
understand that in fact I read some of
the same things in journals here like
the nation they published it I think
anybody understood it because this was
socialism you know how could you say
this is
antisocial it my VI is not unique I the
left marxists have the same view people
like Anon ponok Carl kch others who you
know they got marginalized and
eliminated because that's what happens
to people who don't have guns you know
but I think they were right the people
who lenon condemned as the ultr left the
infantile ultr leftist they're basically
right you know not in everything
but as were a lot of the anarchist
critics and early on Berard Russell saw
it pretty well early
on but you know by 1920 it was
unmistakable even earlier I think even
earlier I I wasn't alive then but when I
was 12 years old that seemed pretty
obvious to me m do you think that
within the Cor ordinates of the entire
Marxist tradition there will always be
this danger of going towards that
edge well you know I don't regard lenen
as part of the Marxist tradition frankly
what the Marxist tradition is who knows
know right but uh it certainly wasn't
Marx's
position I mentioned his uh belief is
that U in the Revolutionary potential of
the Russian peasantry there certainly
isn't a hint of that in lenon I mean
after you know Marx had a lot of
different views right for example he
thought might be possible to reach
socialism by parliamentary means in the
more bua democratic societies England
was his model of course didn't rule it
out you know and in fact he Marx didn't
have very much to say about Socialism or
communism
you take a look at Marx's
works very you know deep analytic
critique of variety of capitalism
capitalist markets the properties
imperialism and so on but about the
future
Society a couple of scattered sentences
and I think you know just my guess
is for good reasons uh his picture was
that as I understand that that when
working people liberate themselves and
can make their own decisions they'll
determine what kind of a society will be
he's not going to he's not going to
dictate it to
them um I think that's pretty wise stand
frankly do you think that the the newer
forms of say uh authoritarian capitalism
where authoritarian communism existed
once so for example in China or maybe in
Singapore where it was a massive move
against the left and it instituted this
sort of State capitalism but very
regimented do you think that that's the
new danger that we face that's a danger
and there are many dangers of course
yeah I think it's pretty rotten system
frankly I it does keep the streets clean
and you know people get a good technical
education and so on very
repressive but I don't think it's
admirable Society by any means
there was a a
recent uh article in January 2013 by
Alan Johnson um in writing for the
Telegraph and he accused some of the
leftists specifically gek of being left
fascists of promulgating this view of
totalitarianism and violence as
Justified within the left tradition and
something that we should reclaim in the
21st century and how does this
fascination with violence Terror and
geminy stem from the radical left
tradition do you think that it's a part
of it or do you think that it's sort of
this offshoot well you know the radical
left there's a lot of radical left
Traditions but the ones that made any
sense in my view were not committed to
violence except in
self-defense so if you manage to carry
forward significant changes and
Progressive changes maybe rad maybe
institutional changes and you've start
to function and there's an attack on
them
by former centers of Power by outside
powers and so on then you defend
yourself uh I think that's as I said I'm
not a pure pacifist I don't think you
should stop defending yourself when
you're under attack but but under very
special circumstances the idea of
overthrowing
existing forces by violence is a very
questionable one for pretty reasons I
think I mean any Ser people who talk
about Revolution you know it's easy to
talk about but if you want a a a
revolution meaning a significant change
in institutions that's going to be carry
us forward rather than backwards then it
has to meet a couple of conditions one
condition is it has to have uh dedicated
support by a large majority of the
population uh people who have come to
realize that the just goals that they're
trying to attain cannot be attained
within the existing institutional
structure because they'll be beaten back
by force and if a lot of people come to
that realization then they might say
well we'll go beyond the What's called
reformism the effort to introduce
changes within the institutions that
exist at that point the questions at
least arise
but we are so remote from that point
that I don't even see any point
speculating about it and we may never
get there maybe Marx is right that uh
within parliamentary democracies you can
use the institutions themselves to go to
a sharp institutional change in fact I
think there's some evidence for that so
for example even in the united in the
United States there are the beginnings
of germs of what would be a my view a
real socialist or communist Society like
worker owned Enterprises it's the
beginnings
of industrial democracy you know popular
democracy in all institutions and how
far can it go well you know if it keeps
going if it does keep going and there is
violent resistance to it then you could
raise the question of using violence to
defend it but if it keeps going it
doesn't meet V resistance will disc
continue it
very
good going off of that there
is this sort of accusations uh I know
since I'm a student as well there's a
accusation from some intellectuals of
students today in higher education that
they're not radical enough or that they
focus on single issues like LGBT rights
or climate change instead of focusing on
radical transformation of Social and
economic systems in their in their
totality what do you think the role of a
student and a university is in
Revolutionary movements
today to be first of all to to learn
enough to understand what you're talking
about uh then if your ideas are
clarified enough to try to work to carry
them forward so let's take these
examples so it take say climate change I
don't think you can discuss climate
change for very long without reaching a
very radical inter interpretation of the
nature of existing institutions and why
they have to be changed um there are
builtin features of our existing
institutions which are leading us
towards
disaster uh with regard to The Climate
built in you can find discussion of this
in marks if you like and so on but uh
it's just part of Market systems uh we
don't really have Market systems it's
mostly fraud but we have partial Market
systems and to the extent that you have
a mar a market system uh
inherent problems of markets do enter
into
operation you can read about them in
economics texts there's a footnote that
talks about market inefficiencies so
what what are the market inefficiencies
well a lot of them one of them which is
not talked about much is that markets
direct your choices in particular areas
like say I can choose to buy a Toyota or
a Chevrolet but I can't choose in a
market system to get a subway system
that's a collective action Market
systems don't allow that so it has an
enormous distorting effect on the set of
choices that are available that's not
discussed because inefficiency but there
are plain inefficiencies even from the
point of view of markets externalities
crucially so for example if you and I
uh make a transaction we'll make make
sure that we make out okay we're not
considering the effects on that guy over
there that doesn't enter into Market
transactions and those effects can be
very substantial uh in fact we're right
in the middle of one right now the
financial crisis
when big institutions like you know
golden Sachs whatever when they uh make
some risky transaction whatever it is uh
if they're paying attention they'll try
to cover their own potential
losses uh but they don't pay attention
to what's called systemic risk the
possibility that their failed
transaction it might bring down the
system and in fact they really don't
have to worry much about that because we
don't have a market system so therefore
they can run cap in hand to the nanny
State and say bail me out and that's
what happens
but if it was a market system that's it
would lead
to a total collapse this way it leads to
massive financial disaster and then
theat State comes in and bails you out
up to a point well those are
externalities but there's a much more
serious
one if um say U the business World say
energy corporations or for that matter
both politic iCal parties who work for
the corporate sector basically if they
decide as they are doing that we should
extract every drop of
oil every of every bit of hydrocarbons
from underground including tarand and
everything else uh they have you know
they're very excited about very euphoric
you can read it in the newspapers every
day you know David Brooks this morning
both parties this will be wonderful
little it'll save us from
uh subservient to Middle East oil
dictators and Venezuela for which there
isn't one particle of evidence but the
that and will be self-sufficient for
energy independent for a century but
meanwhile there's a slight externality
will destroy the world uh okay but
that's you don't pay attention to that
in a quazi market system that's not part
of the transaction the transaction let's
make as much money as we can tomorrow
and for governments let's have as much
power as we can uh but not uh well okay
our grandchildren won't have a world to
live in that's an externality it's not
part of the system and and here you
can't run to anybody cap in hand to bail
you out so that's but this is almost
inherent in the institutions we have and
you can see it happening so if you look
at it's kind of striking when you look
at the world today there's if there's
ever a future historian they're going to
be amazed at what they see in the early
21st century I mean uh there are a
variety of reactions
to very likely climate environmental
disaster it is very likely in fact not
very far away perhaps and there are a
variety of reactions there some that are
trying to do something about it U so in
the lead trying to do something about it
are the pre-industrial societies the
indigenous
societies the tribal societies you know
first nations in Canada or indigenous
people in Ecuador Bolivia and so on
Australia you know all over they're in
the lead they want to do something about
it and they are so for example in say
Ecuador which is an oil
producer uh the government is trying to
get some support for leaving their oil
in the ground which is where it ought to
be so that's the indigenous societies
then you go up to the
richest most powerful Societies in
history incomparable advantages peak of
Western Civilization they're trying to
race the disaster as fast as
possible uh so you know this silly
Indians want to leave their oil in the
ground we want to get it out as fast as
possible so we can wreck the envir for
our grandchildren that's the world we
live in now you can't go very far
talking about climate change without
running into fundamental features of our
basic institutions so I don't think this
dichotomy means much and that's true on
every other issue you look at too right
you very quickly run into institutional
factors that are deeply rooted in the
nature of the society so you go quite
quickly to what's called a radical IAL
critique this doesn't have anything to
do with violence and it's a side issue
right so do you think that for students
today and in our universities it's
actually in a society like that we live
in today say in the United States it's
important to focus on these single
issues because they in themselves
contain a critique of the system it's
important to begin with the issues that
interest and concern you that's just for
any almost anything but if you just look
at those issues you're quickly going to
get into deep ER ones and I think you
have to think about the whole range I
mean nobody can be an activist working
on everything you know right that's
impossible so if you really want to do
something you're going to focus you have
to whatever it may turn out to be but as
soon as you do Focus if you think about
it you're going to find that you're
facing fundamental questions about the
nature of
the social and Economic Institutions in
which we live and the political ones and
then you're going to link up with other
people were work on their issue and they
have they'll run into the same problems
so I just don't see a contradiction that
this is It's where activism
leads very good and so many people are
asking in the wake of the Occupy
Movement how are we to rebuild the left
in America today if it's even possible
to have some sort of change and I'd like
to ask what your vision is for a renewed
left in America
today first of all the a lot of activism
and a lot of concern on all kinds of
issues probably more than than the
60s but it's it's pretty scattered it's
a very atomized Society so a lot of the
actions are scattered I mean right here
in Boston for
example it's very striking give talks
and around different parts of the city
there places where they're doing the
same thing as in some other part of the
city but they don't know about each
other it's it's amazing I mean I found
out myself you know I've been involved
here for activism in years and years and
not long ago I was invited to give a
talk in downtown Boston by a group I'd
never heard of we doing fantastic things
I never heard of it you know because
it's happens to be downtown Bost another
one going on somewhere else so there's a
lot happening it's got to moved together
it's got to find Common Ground the
Occupy Movement I think has been very
successful very brief in a very brief
period you know couple of months after
all it uh it changed the discourse in
the country changed a lot of the
perceptions and mentality brought a lot
of people together it's uh contrary to
what's claimed it's active and
functioning doing a lot of important
things like actions on
foreclosures even hit the news recently
with being the first on the scene after
the Hurricane Sandy and many things
going on and that's all to the good and
uh I mentioned before that there are
other things happening like uh say
development of worker owned Enterprises
that's could be happening right here
there if there were an active movement
it could be involved in similar
initiatives which begin to take off but
often are aborted because they don't
have enough popular support there could
give you some real cases if we had time
and uh reaching out into one of the very
good initiatives of the Occupy Movement
was the occupy the hood uh spin-offs I
don't know how far they got actually
farther than people think I believe I
didn't think they got very far but I
have met groups activist groups working
in uh the so-called ghettos and the
slums who were spin-offs of this and are
still working and doing interesting
things in fact growing so I think
they're probably out there you know we
don't hear a
lot of course the media obviously aren't
going to cover it but we also don't use
our own options it's quite striking that
you take a look at the left the last 40
years uh one of the very sharp criticism
it's had is of the media that they don't
do the things we ought to be doing
that's true they're not going to
corporate media but there are opport
opportunities always have been
so when the Congress passed the law 40
40 years ago I guess uh Distributing
rights to cable
television uh there was a component of
the law which required the private
companies that got the Monopoly which is
very profitable to require them to put
up public t cable
facilities and they did so in Cambridge
and Le and towns all over the place
there are public cable facilities I've
been on them occasionally they're it's
not CBS but you know by standards of
most countries it's unbelievably good do
we use them almost never almost nothing
there some things but like the came you
can reach an awful lot of people that
way if you do something about it but you
have to do it you know and Bost then
again is an interesting City and there's
a lot of activism but it's one of the
cities that basically has no public no
has no Community
radio small things here and there but
you know other a lot of other
communities have Community radio but
when you travel around the country and
you see you see that in places where
there is a community a live Community
radio station with a lot of public
participation and so on that people know
what other people are doing it's a way
of bringing people together and uh uh if
if you don't have it it's scattered but
you know those are not in super all
barriers uh there are a lot of things
that can be done and I think out of that
can grow whatever movement will grow out
of it depends what the participants
decide to commit themselves to very good
my last question so I don't keep you um
slavo GJ in an interview to the new
statement in 2009 said about you my
friend told me chsky said something very
sad he said that today we don't need
Theory all we need to do is tell people
empirically what is going on here I
violently disagree facts are facts and
they are precious but they can work in
this way or that facts alone are not
enough you have to change the
ideological background I'm sorry I'm an
old-fashioned Continental European
theory is sacred and we need it more
than ever how would you respond to this
claim have a sense I first of all quite
age that just spewing out facts means
nothing and in our discussion here we
haven't just been spewing out facts it's
within a framework it's in with a
framework of understandings and
principles and so on uh in the European
intellectuals he's talking about have a
concept of theory which in my view is
totally devot almost radically divorced
from facts and radically divorced from
Theory it's mostly big complicated words
that may be fun for intellectuals to
throw around to each other but uh most
of it I think it's gibber tell you the
honest truth it's not theory in any
sense that I understand and I've been
involved most of my life in the Sciences
where there are theories and so on so
sure if you can find a theory that has
some real principles and which are some
interest and uh uh you can draw
conclusions from them which you can
apply
to interpreting the actual world around
sure that's wonderful but uh and if
there are such theories you know I'm
happy to see them but I don't find them
when I read a Paris
postmodernist talk what I see is
intellectuals kind of interacting with
one another in ways which are
incomprehensible to the public and to be
frank in comprehensible to me so sure
let's have uh the that have some
intellectual content some consequences
can be refined changed lead us to better
understanding it's fine very good thank
you so much I really appreciate it
