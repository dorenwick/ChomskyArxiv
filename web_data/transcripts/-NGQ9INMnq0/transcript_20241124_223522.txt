uh you're all very welcome indeed to
this our 13th and final seminar in the
hosting the stranger series sponsored by
guestbook project and the institute for
the liberal arts here at Boston College
the title of tonight's seminar is
hostility and Hospitality in
contemporary World
politics and uh anybody who hasn't been
able to make it here this evening can
watch it uh post it on the
website uh it's a very special pleasure
to introduce our first guest this
evening no
chsky and he will speak first and after
uh him we will have presentations from
Ali vanazi and Steven
fo let me begin on a personal note if I
may Noom has been a good friend for many
years now in fact since the number of
visits that he paid to University
College Dublin in the
1990s when I had the pleasure of Hosting
him and his late and wonderful wife
Carol they in turn were most generous
hosts to me and my family when we
arrived as guests and strangers on these
Shores in
1999 when we moved from Dublin to Boston
College I'm particularly grateful for
the very warm welcome which norm and
Carol offered us at their homes in
Lexington and Cape Cod in fact Carol was
the first person to teach my daughters
Simon and Sarah how to cross country ski
in their back Garden in
Lexington and she also introduced us to
the charms of accordion music which she
loved to play herself and which she
enjoyed listening to as I recall on a
number of occasions in Dublin
pubs so I'm very grateful indeed to
Carol anenome for their very gracious
and generous
Hospitality I should also mention that
gnome is really no great stranger to a
Catholic
University in that he was
baptized by his Irish nanny called Mary
unbeknownst to his
[Laughter]
parents at a very early age she
kidnapped him and brought him to mass
and decided she could not let his soul
be damned in Hell forever so no is a
very early memory of a big white a
gentleman with a big white Al and water
being poured in his head and various
lights going on on off um so
there gnome as you know is a
world-renowned philosopher linguist
cognitive scientist political activist
and author he's written and lectured on
these subjects throughout the five
continents and is rightly recognized as
not only the founder of modern
Linguistics but also a very brave and
uncom compromising spokesperson for
human Justice and freedom ladies and
gentlemen no
[Applause]
chsky one of the uh main themes of
current politics is the difference in
style between the outgoing president and
the incoming
president uh and in fact the title of
this uh seminar is almost a metaphor for
the uh apparent differences between them
uh George Bush especially during his
first term he and his administration
were Mar the administration was marked
by extreme hostility Brazen arrogance
contempt uh so much that it alienated
even close allies and the US the US
standing in the world sank to its lowest
ranking ever
recorded uh Obama on the other hand is
uh his
uh sort
of
radiates empathy and
U
and
Hospitality so for example in his recent
trip to Europe he welcomed the Europeans
as partners instead of denouncing them
as
irrelevant uh if they didn't follow us
commands uh he reached out to the uh
Muslim world to Latin
America uh offered a new era of
friendship uh he greeted antagonists
with uh handshakes instead of a clenched
fist uh called for constructive dialogue
and mutual respect it would be hard to
imagine uh more Polar Opposites in the
political
Spectrum uh well the crucial qu a
crucial question for world affairs is
whether this difference of style is
style alone or whether it's also a
difference of substance and that's not a
trivial question to answer to answer you
have to look behind Beyond The
Superficial rhetoric and investigate
what's actually being said now that's
throughout history our history and the
history of others it's been quite common
to find that a very forthcoming uh
hospitable stance uh in fact masks
something quite different so let me
think about ask you to think about a few
examples which are deeply embedded in
our own in our own history and our own
culture
uh right here in
Massachusetts actually a good place to
start is with the Massachusetts Bay
Colony in 1620s 380 years ago the
Massachusetts Bay Colony as maybe you
know had a great seal uh the Great Seal
of the
colony uh shows an Indian with his naked
Indian Spears pointed down sign of peace
and a scroll coming out of his mouth
presumably because he couldn't talk
English uh saying come over and help us
okay that's massachusett Bay Colony uh
so the colonists then were responding to
the plea of uh the natives to be rescued
from their bitter uh Pagan fate and the
colonists were showing the indigenous
population the uh noblest form of hostil
hospitality we're coming here at your
request to uh
uh rescue you uh this is probably the
first example of what's nowadays called
humanitarian intervention we respond to
the pleas of people to come and rescue
them and that's the Massachusetts Bay
Colony uh un likee uh many of its
successors uh as history has shown uh it
turned out to be something a little
different uh and those consequences were
not at all obscure to the agents so for
example the first Secretary of
War General Henry Knox described the
utter exter of all the Indians in the
most popular populous parts of the Union
starting right here by means more
destructive to the Indian natives than
the conduct of the conquerors of Mexico
and Peru which is horrible enough some
years later John Quincy Adams actually
long after his own disgrace role in his
activities was over uh
described that he lamented the fate of
what do you call that hapless race of
Native Americans which we are
Exterminating with such merciless and
perfidious cruelty uh something which
went on after his lament and left very
little there and others too were no less
aware of what they were doing as they
answered the plea of the natives to come
over here and help us uh there is a more
acceptable interpretation and that's the
one that's come down in history in one
or another form according to this
version uh by the mysterious will of
most of quoting by the mysterious will
of Divine Providence the Indians just
melted away like the snow in springtime
as they were replaced in a natural way
by a superior race the colonists were
blameless Supreme cour Court Justice uh
Joseph story explained in 1828 that the
colonists constantly respected Indians
but to the dismay of their Puritan
benefactors everywhere at the approach
of the white man the Indians Fade Away
we hear the rustling of their footsteps
like that of the withered leaves of
Autumn and they're gone forever and we
are left to ponder the wisdom of
Providence and to sigh at the constant
sacrifices of this bold but uh wasting
race uh that's 1830 by the
1960s a lot more of this but coming to
the 1960s
1969 a standard work of American
diplomatic history uh by a leading
liberal historian could cheerfully
relate that after their Liberation from
English rule Americans turned to the
task of felling trees in Indian
and expanding to their natural borders
with no comment that's
normal uh well by that time providential
explanations were less in favor though
by no means entirely so so when he was
about to invade
Iraq George Bush instructed Americans
that we do not claim to know all the
ways of Providence yet we can trust in
them placing our conf idence in the
loving God behind all of life and all of
history as we proceed to carry out his
will uh by uh going over there to help
them in Iraq much like the aay
colonists uh in uh
gratitude the survivors of this
benevolence have chosen uh as their icon
the now famous
shoeer uh and quite generous Al the
victims don't seem to recognize properly
the benevolence of their benefactors who
come over to
help uh and quite generally in fact Wars
of aggression and Terror have been
framed in terms of what's called
America's Mission or the purpose of
America and so on and should add that
apart from the religious overtones which
are more pretty specific to the United
States apart from that the United States
it's hardly alone in these postures in
fact won't go through the record but you
find you know great benevolence and
the Japanese fascists bringing an
Earthly Paradise to the backward the
natives in China Hitler who was going to
rescue the checks from the ethnic
conflict and spread the German
benevolence over them in fact anybody
can think of it's Universal hard to find
exceptions well in internal discussion
you do find differences so these
protestations of the humanitarian
concern of hospitality and generosity
they're often laced with cynicism and
contempt
internally uh we are unusually Lucky in
this respect we a free country so we
have a huge internal record of
Declassified documents about what people
were really thinking and some of them
are very instructive
in fact I think relevant to today so
take say the uh Missile Crisis 1962
Cuban Missile Crisis which
historian Arthur Schlesinger kenedy's
advisers describe later as maybe the
most dangerous moment in history which
indeed it was the fate of the world was
at stake well uh Washington was making
the decisions and it refused to inform
its British Ally of the steps that it
was taking steps that literally
threatened Britain survival as they knew
uh and Washington there is something
called the special relationship between
Britain and the US and the Washington's
perception of the special relationship
was articulated by senior Kennedy
advisor in internal discussion uh he
said Britain will act as our Lieutenant
the fashionable word is partner and
Britain likes to hear the fashionable
word but the masters of the world
understand the uh the real word and a
cynic or maybe a realist uh could uh
interpret Obama's polite uh gestures of
partnership as resort to the fashionable
word world Which Europeans like to hear
much more than abuse in fact they
welcomed it with Euphoria uh departure
from bushes that raising arrogance uh
but but we have to determine just what
it
means
colonists the fasc Japanese fascists
others we're
also not short of very uplifting
rhetoric well to find out what lies
behind it you have to take a look at
examples and look at them carefully so
take for example
Iran Obama was greatly praised for his
new year's message to the Iranian people
uh which indeed was quite different from
Bush's rhetoric uh and it was very
respectful he offered to welcome Iran
into the community of civilized Nations
just a model of
hospitality there was a condition
however uh Iran has to renounce arms and
violence if it wants to be accepted if
it we're going to be very hospitable but
you know you have to react
just imagine yourself as let's say a
martian uh watching all of this without
the ideological framework that's
instilled into us so deeply that almost
nobody can see it uh so here's what was
happening the uh president of the most
powerful nation in the world which is
occupying two countries uh on Iran's
borders and spends as much in armaments
as the rest of the world combined is is
telling the Iranians that they have to
abandon arms and violence I won't even
speak of the record of violence uh Iran
no could you speak more into the mic we
have a hard time hearing you back sorry
can't hear
me okay should have told me earlier than
all those precious words you missed uh
is any
better put this here
to how if I just
take is that better yes okay
you can guess everything that came up
until now so just to go back one minute
uh I started talking about Iran uh
Obama's generous Hospital message to
Iran we're going to we're eager to
welcome you into the Civilized world but
of course you have to meet a condition
the condition is that you abandon uh
arms and
violence and now we try to abstract
ourselves from our own circumstances and
culture and situation and try to look at
this from the outside Obama's the
president of the most powerful country
in the world with a record of violence
that's kind of unmatched it spends about
as much on armaments as the rest of the
world combined it happens to be
occupying two countries conquered two
countries on the borders of Iran uh
that's the one who's giving the lecture
who's receiving the lecture a country
that has a a military budget which is
approximately the same as
Kuwait's fraction of Israel's military
budget per capita terms far less hasn't
carried out any aggression for a couple
hundred years uh but they have to
abandon arms and violence in order for
our hospitable gesture to be uh carried
forward and this proceeds without a
comment and if you think about what that
means there it means that there is an
unexpressed principle
the unexpressed principle is we own the
world so therefore everything we do is
right and just by definition we can make
mistakes even the most noble people can
make mistakes but everything is
fundamentally right and just and if you
don't accept that you're the criminal
doesn't matter what the facts are and
there are plenty of facts uh which
aren't brought up in uh uh in discussion
of these interchanges actually they
sometimes are brought up there was a
good column in the Boston Globe a couple
of days ago by John Turman my colleague
at MIT who brought up the Unspeakable
facts uh in just to take recent history
uh for over half a century the United
States without a single letup has been
torturing the people of Iran in
1953 US and Britain overthrew the
Parliamentary regime and installed a
tyrant the sha who ruled with brutality
and torture and Terror until he was
overthrown in 1979 and with almost no
comment here on the crimes that he was
carrying out I news paper coverage was
approximately zero it's been studied if
you're interested 1979 he was
overthrown and uh very shortly uh the US
began to support Saddam Hussein in his
uh war of aggression against Iran and
supported him all the way through in
fact supported him very strongly in fact
us support for Saddam was so unusual
that Saddam was given
really unparalleled the uh latitude to
carry out actions that no one else can
carry out Iran under Saddam is the only
country in the world that could ever get
away with attacking a US ship and
killing several dozen Sailors I Israel
did it but you know they are the prime
Ally but San was able to do too he could
do it and got away with a slight
reprimand the USS Stark
1987 uh meanwhile Saddam was using
chemical warfare rean pretended not to
know killing hundreds of thousands of
Iranians finally the US basically won
the war for sunam uh right after that
the US turned to harsh sanctions against
Iran uh and it continues without a stop
that's over 50 years of steady torture
well Obama has an answer to that uh he
says we should look forward not backward
uh that's a very convenient stance for
those who hold the club uh those who are
at the other end of the club don't
usually accept it so readily and this is
case to uh anyway that's the
forthcoming uh message of uh uh
President Obama to Iran which are so
much welcomed and praised let's take
something that just happened a couple of
days ago the Latin American Summit in
Trinidad the leading issue as I'm sure
you know was Cuba and here again uh
Obama was highly praised for a
forthcoming move to welcome Cuba to the
Civilized world uh what did he do what
was behind that Pleasant rhetoric well
what he did was to remove some of uh
George Bush's extremist uh uh
conditions and go back to what was prush
the conditions that he removed were so
unpopular that even the Cuban American
Community was strongly opposed to them
so that's the gesture uh but there was
no relaxation of the Embargo uh the
Embargo uh is uh condemned and for years
has been condemned by the entire world
uh for its uh savagery and even its
criminality but the US is not entirely
alone in the annual votes at the United
Nations last one last December uh the
United States is joined by Israel
reflexively they have to do what the US
tells them even though they don't
observe the Embargo and by a few Pacific
Islands so we're not totally alone and
this has been going on for years uh well
that's uh there's a reason for this
actually there are critics like the
Boston Globe who say that the Embargo is
a mistake uh in the words of the globe
editorial a couple days ago uh the
Embargo has not achieved its aim of
hastening democratic change in Cuba so
it's not working so therefore we have to
change it uh there is a question that
should come to mind uh how do the globe
editors know that that was the aim of
the
Embargo I mean it's true that there's
evidence our leaders say so but that's
not overwhelming evidence it turns out
there's other sources of evidence which
are quite Rich the Declassified internal
record and that tells us what the aim of
the Embargo was so quote you a few
things from the Kennedy years and the
early Johnson years so not from the
right this is kind of from What's called
the left in American politics uh the uh
problem of Cuba we find out in the
internal record is Cuba's successful
Defiance it's the words that are used
Cuba's successful Defiance of US
policies going back to the the Monro
Doctrine 150 years the Monro Doctrine
announced that we're going to roll the
hemisphere they couldn't do it then
Britain was too powerful but that was
the pronouncement and the Cuba is
defying it and successfully defying it
nothing about the Russians you know
nothing about
communism starting revolutions or
anything else just successful Defiance
of the Master's rule uh that's and and
their their uh evil nature is ill
Illustrated as Kennedy's Latin American
adviser Arthur Schlesinger wrote uh
because of the threat of what he called
the Castro idea of taking matters into
one's own hands uh which is a grave
threat to the hemisphere when the poor
and underprivileged in other countries
stimulated by the example of the Cuban
Revolution are now demanding
opportunities for a decent living so is
worse than successful Defiance it's what
sometimes called the threat of a good
example others might try the same thing
it's what Henri Kissinger called the a
virus that might spread contagion he was
talking about the end days Chile which
we got rid of on the what in Latin
America is called the first
911 worse than the second one in fact uh
but we took care of that but Chile was a
like Cuba is a virus spreading contagion
maybe as far as Europe where uh Social
Democratic parties might see I end their
success as a indication that
parliamentary methods can be used to
insute social change and obviously you
can't have that or the whole world
system falls apart in fact if you look
through Cold War history honestly you'll
find that that was the leading theme
constantly I mean it's dressed up as
communist aggression and so on you know
Nicaragua is going to invade us Grenada
has an air base which the Russians can
use to bomb us if they can find it on
the map and one thing after another but
the real concern is pretty much the same
wherever we have records uh uh
successful independent development might
Inspire others to try the same thing
Vietnam War was the same uh so yes
that's the reason for that's the threat
of Cuba very precisely explained in the
internal record and uh therefore uh you
have to take obvious steps uh the the uh
uh and the steps were described uh we
have to uh uh uh punish the Cuban people
was immediately decided a few months
after Castro's takeover we have to
punish the Cuban people to compel them
to overthrow the government in 1960 the
state department uh said that Castro
could would be removed through
disenchantment and disin disaffection
based on economic dissatisfaction and
hardship and every possible means should
be undertaken promptly to weaken the
economic life of Cuba in order to bring
about Hunger desperation and the
overthrow of the government uh
Eisenhower was then president approved
of sanctions in the expectation that uh
if the Cuban people are hungry they will
throw Castro out Kennedy came in shortly
after and he agreed that the uh embargo
would hasten Castro's departure as a
result of the Rising discomfort among
hungry Cubans uh Kennedy also initiated
a major terrorist campaign uh its goal
was to bring the Terrors of the earth to
Cuba in the words of uh historian Arthur
Schlesinger as Latin American
adviser writing the semi-official
biography of Robert Kennedy to whom this
task was assigned bring the Terrors of
the earth to Cuba and it was no joke uh
all of this has disappeared Into The
Mists of uh history like uh withered
leaves of autumn you know like the
natives who used to con contaminate
these Shores uh and again we must uh
look uh forward not backwards in Obama's
words and uh we while critics there are
critics and they Lament The failure of
our effort our Noble effort to bring the
blessings of democracy namely by
violence and economic strangulation to
punish the people for their Disobedience
and successful Defiance and for their
threatening to present a model that
others might want to follow uh
incidentally all of this is done over
the objections of a large majority of
the population of the United States
which for decades has been in favor of
calling for a normalization of relations
with Cuba uh it's not only the same is
true with Iran but uh these are the
strange ways of democracy Meanwhile
we're trying to bring them
democracy uh well the uh concept of
humanitarian intervention has come a
long way since its Origins and the Great
Seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
since the Puritans offered their
Hospitality to the Indians who were
pleading with them to come over and help
us uh at the end of the last Millennium
it had become the the favored concept of
uh the intellectual classes in the
United States also in in in the west
generally uh they were deeply impressed
by the fact that after the digression in
the Cold War which sort
of diverted us from our great Mission uh
after this digression
uh American foreign policy I'm quoting
from now on American foreign policy had
entered a noble phase with a saintly
glow as the idealistic New World bent on
saving Humanity was acting from altruism
alone on the basis of principles and
values for the first time in history
adopting What's called the
responsibility to protect and carrying
out actions that were indeed illegal as
recognized but were legitimate uh
because uh of the nobility of the
mission actually I'm quoting from from
highly respected liberal sources uh uh
in a chorus of self- congratulation that
I don't think has any counterpart in
history at least I can't find one this
astonishing chorus the last years of the
Millennium uh and there was an issue the
issue was the bombing of Serbia that's
what demonstrated the Fantastic nobility
of our
altruism uh there are uh there was
there's a story about it the bombing was
undertaken to prevent the ongoing
genocide of kavars there are a couple of
problems with the story one is that the
uh atrocities weren't the cause of the
uh bombing they were the consequence of
it uh the bombing in fact as was
anticipated clearly anticipated sharply
escalated the level of atrocities uh
which before that you know not pretty
but kind
of by comparative standards limited and
the split between serbs
and K kasar guerillas but the bombing as
anticipated General Clark warned
Washington that this was happened in
fact informed the Press uh right after
the bombing started of course there was
a sharp increase in atrocities as
expected uh and uh began the flow of
refugees and all the terrible stories
you read
that was actually revealed in the
indictment of mosovich but the
commentators here were polite enough not
pretend not to notice it he was indicted
in the middle of the bombing but if you
look at the indictment it was almost
entirely for alleged crimes after the
bombing there was one dubious exception
but even if you believe it uh it was
almost entirely for the result of the
bombing and the anticipated result so it
couldn't be that we were bombing to save
the covars from
genocide
uh rather obvious what was going on and
sometimes even conceded another little
flaw in the argument is that at the same
time that the US and Britain were in the
noble phase of their foreign policy with
the saintly glow they were not only
tolerating but actively
supporting uh decisively supporting uh
crimes and atrocities that were well
beyond anything anything reported in
covo but that's another minor difficulty
just fact facts don't really matter uh
in uh these Affairs uh now the
cynicism kep kept hidden in the rich and
powerful countries the ones who hold the
clubs you know we can keep it hidden
from ourselves but it's not uh it's not
hard for others to see in fact they are
well aware of it uh as usual what they
say is silenced but if you work you can
hear it so for example right after the
bombing of Serbia there was a meeting of
the South Summit the heads of state of
the non-line countries g77 most of the
world in fact and they had a bitter cond
condemnation of the bombing and also of
the uh what they called the uh the
so-called right of humanitarian
intervention they condemned that as just
a cover for traditional
imperialism that was kept silent couple
years later the United Nations had a
highlevel commission uh to on the notion
of responsibility to protect uh very
respected figures like Brent skra George
Bush number one's National Security
advisor Gareth Evans former prime
minister of Australia head of the
international crisis group and other
distinguished Western figures and they
considered the responsibility protect
and they concluded that uh it must be
maybe there is responsibility to protect
they said but it must be restricted to
the United Nations security Council that
is as they put it uh there's
restrictions in the UN Charter on the
use of force saying you're allowed to
use Force either under security Council
orders or under direct attack until the
security Council can act they said that
should not be changed no one else has a
right to use Force for a responsibility
to protect uh they pointed out that it
would simply be used as an excuse for
aggression uh they were actually
reiterating what the world Court had
concluded in one of its earliest
decisions Corfu case in the late
1940s uh and the general assembly
shortly after uh re strongly reaffirmed
this conclusion so yes there might be a
responsibility to protect but it's what
it always was in the hands of the
security Council uh it's inly of some
interest perhaps that the US population
uh strongly supports this view popular
view in the United States is that the
United Nations should take the lead in
international crisis uh the US should go
along with them like other law-abiding
States almost exactly the opposite of
policy no matter who's in office and
that too is nicely silenced uh these are
uh facts only and uh
throughout history facts have been
regarded as a minor impediment to
establishing and
promulgating ideological Necessities
well these are a few of the many
thoughts that come to mind at least to
my mind in uh ruminating about uh
hostility and uh hospitality and
contemporary
[Applause]
politics
[Applause]
thank you no and we will have hopefully
plenty of time for question and answer
later where you can take up uh some of
these points with our speakers um our
second panelist this evening is Steven
fo a colleague and
Professor uh of Sociology here at Boston
College he has written numerous books
including images of deviant and social
control death at the parasite
Cafe Left Behind religion technology and
flight from the
flesh he's co-editor of a volume called
culture power and history studies in
critical
sociology and is author of The
forthcoming Venus in video cybernetics
and ultramodern power Steven is also a
past president of the society for the
study of social problems and a video
maker and a Performing
Artist his title this evening is from
hostility to hospitality Reckoning with
haunted histories of
power
I've taught in this classroom before so
I know how to play around with this a
little
bit in thinking of remarks a lot of
things that Nome just was talking about
you know really resonate with me I his
concern with why facts don't count we
can have all the facts we want but they
don't really in fact make a difference
within a place in American society where
I think the word you used that ideology
becomes installed into us so there's a
kind of forgetfulness and
inattentiveness um but the the crime s
you know the massive place of domination
and their effects these things don't go
away just because we don't consciously
recognize them so talk is about
hauntings how really the violence of our
own history surrounds us like an
atmosphere how we push it away you know
push it keep it away deny it and so
forth as a large collectivity and yet it
continues to come back so what kind of
methods particularly since we're talking
we situated this in the University what
kind of methods of Knowledge Learning
and learning are appropriate to begin to
reckon uh with these hauntings and
that's a stage you know Truth and
Reconciliation it's a stage that deal
with that truth on the way toward sort
kind of
reconciliation in thinking about how to
begin remarks I was just amused last
week when I saw Hugo Chavez president of
Venezuela uh give a book to President
Obama and of course this new style of
Engagement and so forth I was also
really taken uh by the tax on right-wing
radio that Obama received this book
people like Michael Savage I heard just
last night talking about this is just
the swamps of liberalism for him to
accept this book a new comrade this is
what I told you he's a
socialist the book he
gave in course make this connection to
this panel I mean n chamski is our
featured speaker um Hugo chav has
recommended one of Nom chomsky's books a
couple years ago you know at the UN he
recommended that everyone to read you
know hegemony or survival America's
Quest for Global nomination this again
had a you know talk wi radio uh Nome
chomsky's book rose up on Amazon at that
time the complexity of global
circulations and stories uh but so did
Eduardo galliano's book became number
two as of Monday on amton uh the English
version open veins of the 19171 Spanish
version
laana
Latina a history of the violence in the
new world brought by Europe brought by
North American Powers a rather long
history that n chumsky has participated
in amplifying um both these books u in
many ways become kind of outside a
cursed text for a problem of forgetting
for a culture based on forgetting our
own memories in some sense sort of keep
away our reality and so forth uh the
work of gallano um is a historical work
and it's unusual because much of what we
know about him today is this kind of
hybrid form that plays with fiction that
plays with history that plays with
poetry that tries to conjure up in a
style uh that's meant to bring power to
the surface to bring memory to the
present and so forth um so memories of
fire the three volume work I think is
what's most known uh in English um but
this book um that is recommended that
that Obama now has the Spanish copy of
uh the open veins of Latin America uh
was written intensely in three weeks uh
years of research but three weeks of
intensive writing as soon as it was
published it establish gallano in some
sense as an ethical voice uh and a major
author uh from the south uh uh speaking
to problems about how north south
relationships work and the violence that
they beget um a reviewer a couple years
after the book was published um writing
from the point of view of more respected
history says the book really is
obviously well received in Latin America
has become the voice of Latin American
intellectuals on the other hand the book
doesn't have properly scholarly
Detachment uh it lists facts and
histories but doesn't do those with a
sense of neutrality and scholarly
objectivity uh gallano himself responds
by objectivity being a haunted place of
forgetfulness as well as memory uh and
how to think of that forgetfulness is
very much connected to this sort of a
call upon uh Obama to play in the swamps
of the swamps of liberalism just when I
heard that ter swamps I can't help but
think of Claus Tal's book called male
fantasies which is a history of really
people growing up in the power
atmosphere of what became national
socialism Claus tev's father was a Nazi
was part of the freec cor and talite to
understand Nazi power um tells not just
the facts but much like gallano tries to
go to the atmosphere looks at the
biographies the writings the
Fascinations the fears of these men that
became National Socialist and that the
term swamp appears everywhere the morass
the swamp the liquid the worrisome they
associate this with femininity associate
this with impurity a demand for a pure
history cleansed of memories of the
actual violence those histories may be
get Edward gallano later criticized
veins himself suggesting his own attempt
to kind of have just an objectivity
carried the facts but he like n chsky
just argued FS may not be enough the
facts are there um but how to read them
how to allot them to affect us how to
actually begin to recognize that
Massachusetts Bay Colony uh begins with
a project uh that's called generosity
called Hospitality but maybe really
nothing but hostility and maybe the word
should be Sol a new kind of genocide um
uh some of this talk will be based on
work that was done here at Boston
College the dissertation that became a
book by Avery Gordon in the sociology
Department called ghostly matters
Haunting in the sociological imagination
19 7 1997 University of Minnesota press
book where Gordon really tries to look
for methodology to come to terms with
why we can't come to terms with facts to
come to terms in embodied the sometimes
poetic certainly political way with why
really the actual materiality of History
um often just turns into the fictions we
live by we live in a decent country of
freedom and democracy freedom is on the
March as said the arrogance of George
Bush in his work called Walking work
words um uh gallano invites us to really
look at in some sense what Manuel
Castell when he looks at the ruins of
new Global liberalism uh the new
neoliberalism circulates the planet
calls the fourth world to be located not
just South of the Border uh but really
uh in every major economically developed
Place uh fourth world citizens that
become marginalized always on the
outside of power but haunting Power by
their acts of defiance sometimes by
their terrible Deeds I'm trying to
really find power in ways that don't get
aren't legitimate that can't be there
gallano writes in Walking words a story
and as us to connect to the story of
Elgato uh the cat a young ragged unkempt
stoned often violent a disorderly a
young man you know a child really in
some sense of the bankruptcy of north
south
relationships uh ELO does not pose an
easy
identification uh for sympathy for
Liberal for charity uh uh but it poses a
question really in some sense of the
distortions the monstrosities of power
has actually enacted uh maybe this is
like the fourth world uh gallano in some
sense in his story chastises simply
Christian charity reaching out to help
if it doesn't engage in contesting the
very structures of power that lead one
to need help uh appeasing the desperate
he argues is no substitution for a
different form of transformation at the
gospels He suggests would call us upon
to transform structures not simply to
help those who are victims of them um in
his book on Guatemala uh something that
n chsky has also written about Guatemala
and occupied country a galano really
quotes the voice of the Catholic priest
of the mirino of Father Thomas Melville
Melville says this any capitalist system
whether it's based on lazy fear or not
is essentially based on competition
rugged individualism that separates IND
indviduals from the larger Community the
profit motive it is difficult to see how
such a system though materially
successful in the global thr can ever
actually be supported by Christianity
and Christian societies with their
missions of Love gallano brings us back
to the story of Elgato um he writes
about Elgato um joining a crowd of
urchins on a Christmas day where the
mirror of the local town uh distributes
Christmas blessings dressing up like
Santa Claus on the balcony open to the
Sun the mirror is sweating bullets down
below roaring commotion in the sea of
urchins children in rag a foam of hands
raised up to the sky dressed like a
benign Santa Claus the mirrors throws
down the toys from above a metaphor
really of Christian charity maybe a
metaphor of hostility um
disguising you know hostility you know
cloaked in the mask of of generosity or
hospit ality the toys rain down over the
tumultuous crowd poor children have a
right to happiness these lucky kids Dash
about and flail throwing punches and
insult stepping over one another a
life-sized Dow knocks over several a
space rocket strikes Right Between the
Eyes of another candies fall like rocks
this is a parable of dist stair uh
converting toys into missiles and
projectiles a dark and human humorous
Twist on a war in poverty that poses
itself in the form of Charity but really
presents itself as a reenactment of
hostility Elgato is marginalized by the
economy of exploitation and productive
profit in which he really does not find
a place and yet he still identifies with
it he searches for money he finds a dead
corpse of a rich man takes the wallet
and buys a TV quickly connecting IL you
know illicit gain to like consumption
but with that TV uh and he's noticed
right away for having it it's not
someone of his class should have such a
TV um in the story he's escaped death
squads these groups that go through the
night to help clean up the town remove
the remnants of what actually is
happening and keep the poor out of sight
um he doesn't get any notice for that
he's not in the media for that but as
soon as he's found with this TV it
becomes a televisionary spectacle
himself the police and media converge
and tell the story of yes Law and Order
is being brought South of the Border uh
this is the story that gallano tells
with a number on his chest Elgato
confronts the black eye of the camera
the Magnesium flash freezes him out of
time the shudder clicks showing some
history but keeping others away he
becomes a kind of trophy for a new world
order of cleaning things up he is fully
othered the sociologist Duran talks
about four functions of othering in his
on the functions of crime um the first
form of othering allows us to create
social boundaries that keep the clean
from the you know the unclean they keep
the pure from the impure the second
develops a kind of group solidarity in
this country we call it
patriotism the third is a kind of
scapegoating energy that distracts you
from what haunts you that keeps you from
what makes you nervous um that in some
sense relaxes you um this is also a
function of the policing of the
boundaries the keeping of the other out
there but durkheim also suggests that
working on the boundaries is a dynamic
project this tension between the inside
and the outside the group that's in
privilege and those who are othered is a
constant project it has to be renewed
and it creates a place for openness and
a place for possible transformation a
different future than just reproducing
the selfsame but that place has to be
contested what kind of knowledges do we
pass on to our students that allow those
border places to be contested the allows
the actual facts of domination to be
reckoned with as opposed to just be
pushed aside that's not the American way
thinking about power in several
different ways um you know this this
haunted histories of power um certainly
you know so I don't want to think of
power as just one dimension that it's
only domination it couldn't be other
things um you know with the psychologist
Rolo may I think of power is something
that's a constitutive feature of of
humans we do need certain kind of
boundaries it isn't that there can
always be fluidity and so forth we need
some ways of Reckoning with environments
um but is that a one-way Reckoning where
what is cast into the environment cast
to the outside is constantly dominated
can there be a form of dialogue between
um the sociologist Max vber offers
social science's most well-known
definition of power it's the ability for
those who have it to resist you know
even the hauntings the the resistances
the challenges of those who don't um
it's useful to think about but I think
more complex is the notion of power that
operates something like a field that
we're all in doesn't that you have it
and don't have it and this I think is
one of the gifts of Michelle Fuko to
think of power as an atmosphere a
material force field in which we're all
situated maneuvering um trying to find
places of memory and staged in some ways
by places of forgetting um so I want to
think of this you know place of power as
something that we're in we're complicit
with it um it isn't really just that
some bad people have it and we don't um
how to reckon with our own place within
a field of power and our own
complicities and wondering about how to
challenge those and change those
complicities um and you know and when
you think of power you also want to
think of if it's sometimes just as
forceful as the torture that the US you
know from
1953 uh enforces uh gives provides
assistance techniques AIDS finances for
an Iran um until that is thrown over
over uh you know by the by the
revolution that threw out the Shaw and
his American cronies uh but also to
think of power in a more you know
complex way n chsky writes earlier in
his career about the manufacturing of
consent hegemonic power is also winning
um our consent literally are seducing us
into some memories and keeping us away
from all that stuff that makes our
memories
uneasy U the memories for instance of
what's the actual history uh of our
relationship to a colonized territory
American native peoples and the like um
you know with the election of Obama
maybe not just stylistically I hope
substantively collectively we begin to
deal with the legacies of you know what
the US and or what transatlantic slave
trade did to Africa and how Africans
ended up and how African-Americans have
a genealogy you know literally of having
been a slave and turn distant franchise
into a market but much less present to
most of our memories is what happens
with American native peoples who
continue to exist and I Know PBS is now
having a series on Monday nights that
begins to try to Stage this in some
documentary ways with the voices of
American Indian American Native
indigenous peoples guiding The Narrative
um so I think it's important to think of
one other dimension of power that haunts
us and this is what the Peruvian
sociologist uh anib bell keano calls the
the coloniality of power um that when we
think of racism or even when we think of
you know how gender is or organized
think of the complex webs of how
gendering class and race and nation
state all organized themselves all these
things marked continuously by 500 years
of colonial power um so the distortions
the warps the Fascinations and fears the
exoticisation as well as the just
locking out of others and so forth all
these things need to be part of our
grappling and be part of our in some
sense reckonings and I think our
projects as teachers across Fields need
to reckon with the Scopes of power that
haunt everything from the chemistry lab
and the decisions are made here the
sociology and the theology classrooms or
to the art what kind of art is
imaginable and what kind of Arts aren't
imaginable I mean what kind of things
would just see to us as as ugly or
discordant and so forth and how to how
to think rigorously about these kind of
things what forms of knowledge uh can
transform um gallano himself looks
backwards in time someone who honors
history is a place that when it's
connected to the present opens up new
future es honors history is a place in
the present that when it's possible
opens up new Futures and one of the
histories he goes back to is the
histories of the whole continent both
continent North and South First Nations
um marks and angles of course viewed
indigenous peoples as the model for what
they called A Primitive communism uh
common property communion with nonhuman
as well as human beings communion with
the planet uh with the Earth that was
envisioned as a mother an energetic
materiality ceremonies that were in some
sense matrifocal and guided by gratitude
for the Earth as a hospital living
mother rather than the earth is hostile
in constantly need of our Mastery um I
grew up in Syracuse New York I'm
complicit with these stories I'm telling
as a young boy uh my family used to go
out to the iroy Onaga reservation and I
would dress up right out of popular
culture maybe this is ideology installed
into my body using G chomsky's terms I
would dress up as DAV Crockett I would
get the rifle my family would go to get
the cheap apples and I knew that it was
a dangerous mission to get those apples
I was involved in television so I would
have my gun ready what possibly uh would
the Ananda people think of
me and what did I imagine as
them not the victims of our own
genocidal practices but somehow Savages
and I need to keep my little you know
middle class family away
from these are haunting things
uh to be worried about those things
don't seem rational but this is how in
some sense our history plays itself out
not just fics but embodied sensibilities
Aesthetics uh strange moral twist upside
down reversals and so forth stuff that's
all about emotion and body as well as
cognition so I'm really interested in us
playing with knowledge in a complex way
um particularly recognized that all the
forms of knowledge we have are
sacrificial a term drawn I suppose from
Rel religion but to really think that
once we have some form of framework
other things are left aside are they
temporarily forgotten are they deeply
repressed are are they still you know
something you can't talk about uh for
fear of not being polite not being
patriotic or just not being able to pay
us in public you how do we change these
kind of things um again gallano uh
returns to the question of of those in a
book called we say no returns to the
question of this other side and other
side he said first name first time done
in the name of Christianity the mixture
of crown cross and
sword and we honor the cross and Crown
at Boston College um are we haunted that
the sword went along with those things
should we be how can we be right I how
can we be how can we reckon with the
actual histories that we're
participating in um he writes this after
five centuries of business from all
versions of Christianity onethird of the
American Force has been Anni ated a lot
of once fertile land is sterile half the
population eats infrequently the Indians
victims of the greatest thievery in
world history still suffer usurpation of
the remaining bits of land and are still
condemned to the negation of their own
identity as something primitive Savage
outside real conversation with modernity
they're still prohibited from living
traditional ways their right to be
themselves is still denied at first
pillage and other side were carried out
in the name of God now they're carried
out in the name of neoliberal
progress
sometimes this is preemptive
Warfare what other forms of knowledge
again are possible you know I'm going to
close with some meditations first on
Avery Gordon's book uh hauntings in the
sociological imagination ghostly matters
and then return to one final place from
gallano Gordon invites us to really take
seriously uh as social science scientist
as people in the humanities in the Arts
the project of ghost um and the project
of Haunting um she says this haunting is
a constitutive element of Western
modernity it is neither premodern
Superstition nor an individual form of
psychosis is a generalizable social
phenomena of great importance to study
one's social life today one must
confront what haunts spheres of power
ghost AER operate on that field Destro
in knowledge not making us possible to
confront certain kind of facts in
haunting organized forces and systemic
structures that appear remove from us
make their impact felt in everyday life
in ways that confound our analytic
separations things we try to keep away
from they seep into and cross the
borders she describes the presence of
ghost in this way as a seething presence
remnants of power and power act that we
forget um she also calls these kind of
uncomfort that we experienced around the
edges of what we know and what we forget
uh as really signs of a kind of
empirical evidence that conting is
taking place um she urges us to make
contact with the ghost to reckon with
our actual material histories but
cautions us again that just knowledge of
the facts may not be enough we need I
think what um she calls her subtitle her
book haunting sociological imagination
cite Mills in the book The sociological
imagination 195 9 calls for a mixture of
you know critical biographical analysis
and our social structural position
history that place between he said it
isn't enough just to get factual
information about that place we need a
new sensibility that will allow us
without guilt to reckon with the
consequences of the enormous violence
that we should take be countable or
begin to be responsible for now how do
we do that without just feeling guilt
without feeling paranoia I mean this is
something I think that is the challenge
for us out of this whole seminar series
perhaps how do we begin uh to give
Hospitality first I think we have to
deal with the hostilities that have been
our own um and those are difficult
things to reckon with um I think we're
going to have to sacrifice some of our
privileges certainly sacrifice some of
what we think of as our just cleaned up
self-image change that image um the work
I I usually advocate in this regard is
something like a power reflexive form of
Engagement with these hauntings power
reflexivity deals with resonances as
well facts um that really in some sense
is about an embodied taking seriously
emotion and embodiment taking seriously
sacrifices and hauntings uh that bring
us to a Crossroads where in some sense
um you know we're asked again literally
to reckon with that which we've done
before we can reconcile with others who
we have in some sense pushed to the
outside this sometimes happen at the
very edge of Semitic availability of
things that we don't have good words for
we don't have clean lessons or good
programs for because we've have a whole
history of just doing the opposite of
denying repressing and keeping away
Reckoning Gordon writes is about knowing
what kind of effort becomes required uh
to make the conditions were in different
how to attend to what is acceptable as
well as unacceptable but not just to
notice limits but begin to do what she
calls the work of U uh Walter Benyamin
the profane illumination to spark up
with some courage to spark up what's on
the outside of us that we engage it uh
in my own teaching is to teach things
like what n Chomsky is doing I know I've
used his books so to teach the facts of
history but also ask the students to
engage in a project of dis autobiography
not tell their own story but tell the
story you can't tell unless you reckon
with structures of power that usually
are kept away from us so how to do dis
autobiographical analysis also of course
as a sociology ask students to you know
be in contact
with cultures practices social classes
that otherwise they wouldn't be in
contact with here at shut Hill um so how
I have contact with those who have been
othered and how to have methods that are
attentive in some sense to not only what
the cognitive but the emotional elements
of knowledge that might come from this
and we say no gallano conjures up an
image of a Kind of animistic Blue Tiger
by animism he's talking about those
fields of forces that are not humans
alone that humans participate in some of
those are forces that have to do with
the living energetic nature some of
those are forces that have to do with
histories that just aren't have have not
been you know embodied histories that
have not been claimed um and animism is
also an interesting image that Gordon
uses to talk about this this field of
Reckoning with haunting because it draws
you out of yourself into something
that's quite alive um that actually
beckons you but you don't know what it
is until you begin this Reckoning uh
gallano writes this to hear the voice of
the blue tiger and he creates this kind
of fictional natural histor hisorical
creature that lies below the hammock of
the first father and mother at rest to
hear that voice is to be situated not
simply in a form of therapy like a new
age relaxation really getting into myth
really enjoying yourself and finding
yourself in a kind of personal
Consciousness Enlightenment and so forth
but quite the opposite it's to be
confronted by a Moment of historical
crisis the crisis of really forgetting
what you are part of in history Gano
says though however our Collective
Memory Remains stubbornly alive a
thousand times it's reborn in the hiding
places uh where that blue tiger licks
your womb how how to come in contact
with that wound of wounds that we have
everything to do with um in a in a work
called traditions of the future he
writes this there is just one place
where yesterday's hostilities and
today's hope uh can meet each other and
that's to recognize and embrace each
other but that place is tomorrow how can
we possibly prepare for it that's what
I'm getting to think about he asked us
to return to the ancient voice of
indigenous peoples um to learn a first
lesson and that's the lesson of
community the ancient voice that speaks
to us of people that still remain
Heralds another world Community the
communal mode of production and life
it's the oldest of the American
traditions but a tradition that's left
aside uh when capitalism enters this
land like small poox like the flu it
came from abroad it was not part of the
indigenous scene
he ends and I'll end this way with
somewhat of a poetic meditation
sometimes his work seems magical it's
certainly deeply political it's always
about history but it's about resonances
and hauntings that I think are really uh
everything to do with begin to confront
ghost for the purpose of social justice
not for the purpose of entertainment
that's what you know we ghost all over
the Hollywood screen so how do we really
conr ghost the actual ghost that we live
with um if we were to do that he
suggested our intuitive imagination of a
future begins to open up an imagination
that isn't even possible for us if we're
locked into a present of forgetfulness
there the ear shall be cleansed of all
passions for Domination of all passions
for accumulation and private property
all passions for Empire left alone will
be the passions of human and energetic
world in the streets cars will be run
over by dogs economists will refuse and
will never be able to measure living
standards any longer by consumption
levels or the quality of life by the
quantity of things possessed politicians
shall not believe that the poor actually
like to eat promises food shall not be a
commodity nor shall Communications be a
big business because both food and
communication should be human rights no
one shall die of hunger because no one
will be overeating no one will be
overdeveloped we shall be compatriots
and contemporaries of all who have a
yearning for justice and beauty no
matter where they were born or where
they lived because the borders of
geopolitical time and space shall cease
to exist what will exist is what we have
in conversation together here The
Haunting other uh the ghostly stranger
the exiled alien comes into dialogue
with those of us haunted at the center
of what we might as well call a kind of
Empire an Empire of
forgetfulness here is the possibility
for hostility to be transformed into
something approaching Hospitality thank
[Applause]
you you know fuko's notion of um that
you know fields of power roll from
domination to domination you know I I do
believe that you know every formation of
social life and social power is to some
degree exclusionary I mean you know Fuko
is kind of working with a nitian text
you know that that the fields of force
you know create I think a a will to
power a field of power and there's some
kind of
exclusions um and yet the other hand I
think he dreams of something like a
limit experience that would you know by
his use of genealogy that would in some
ways be able to show how those borders
are constructed but also in some ways
Point toward what isn't there in the
borders and you know be able to haunt us
with that regard I mean fukko although
some people read him as a cynical
theorist of power uh in many ways you
know evoked kind of you know utopian
feelings of of not not you know not in
the way the gallano did that the world
now will be you know kind of harmonic
place that he goes backwards in time and
you know and REM mythologizes a place of
like primitive communism but that we in
some sense could have a a form of of
political practice that would be you
know Vigilant about its exclusions and
you know to me this is the grace of
something like Fuko and his really kind
of Reckoning with this question of limit
experience which is like dealing with
hauntings now how do you de with that
you know how do you in some sense
defamiliarize what we've become
hegemonically embodied as and like what
kind of strategies do we have to begin
to open that up so if Keith you know so
in that sense you know Keith Overman
wouldn't be any better in Bill ay except
if and he recognized what he's talking
about is always historically situated
provisional and will have limits you
know you know so it's not some just this
is the final answer this is you know
dangers like final solutions that you
again start to totalize so I so how how
to have this kind of ongoing vigilance
you know recognize that yes you do need
boundaries and boundaries do involve you
know othering but how do you then fold
those back upon each other so the
Gathering isn't structurally permanent
thank you no do you want to say a word
about
that
well
if I under can you hear me yeah I'm not
sure I understood you and I heard part
of it but if you're saying that we
should try to approach these questions
from a point of view that's beyond
ideology is that yeah I agree with that
I mean there is a world out there and
there are facts about that world and we
can look at them uh you know we're never
we can't get out of our skins and we
recognize we can't get out of our skins
so element of self-criticism but I think
you can look at facts
simple facts pretty realistically I mean
I concede that I'm kind of simple-minded
about these things it doesn't seem to me
fundamentally different than studying
The Sciences where you also can't get
out of your skin and you're
self-critical and you're you know
willing to accept that maybe you're on
the wrong track but I don't see anything
particularly ideological about for
example the uh the meaning of the Great
Seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony or
about the whole notion of human
humanarian Intervention which is a
leading principle of Western
intellectuals and which is a total fraud
I don't think that that's left or right
or anything else it just seems to me you
know that the south is correct when they
say it's just a it's simply a and the
world court is correct when they say
it's just a mask for a traditional
aggression if we can investigate that
you know we can look at the history see
what actually happened and so on and yes
it's uh not free from a point of view
and a perspective and level of
understanding that can be submitted to
self-criticism but it doesn't seem to me
like a particularly complex uh
Enterprise Ali okay
yes
war of drugs was the
future
Dr well let's take a look at the war of
Dr on drugs right I mean it's been
declared probably 20 times in the last
20 years or so every couple of years
it's
declared uh it's declared against a
background of
understanding uh for example it was
studied Years Ago by the ran Corporation
the main government advisory Corporation
and the Army in which they investigated
uh just straight cost benefit analysis
of various ways of treating the drug
problem drug problems here it's not in
Colombia uh so uh they said well you
know which ways of dealing with the
problem here are coste effective and
they found which will surprise no one
who's paid attention to the history that
the most costeffective way of doing it
uh is prevention and
treatment okay in fact if you think
about it that's the way one of the worst
drug problems has been handled I mean
there is a drug which is much worse than
cocaine it's called tobacco it kills far
more people uh than uh cocaine does and
it was handled pretty well by uh
cultural change so if you look through
the
1980s it's a class issue so people with
education and you know degree privilege
simply adopted a more healthy lifestyle
they stopped smoking they stopped eating
red meat they didn't drink as much
coffee and so on there were no police
you know no nobody uh carried out
chemical warfare and North Carolina and
Kentucky to destroy tobacco Fields they
it was simply an educational process a
kind of cultural change that led to a
significant decline of the use of by far
the most dangerous drug uh among people
who were uh a part of
that cultural change that took place
thanks to their privilege okay now
that's exactly what the Rand and the
Army studied years ago uh they were of
course discussing tobacco but that's
exactly what they concluded about the
hard drugs or marijuana they said the
best the cheapest and the most effective
way of dealing with it is prevention and
treatment well there's another way uh
use of police
okay that's much less effective and much
more costly uh there's a Third Way
interdiction at the borders that's still
more expensive by quite a large margin
and far less and far more costly and the
worst way of all you know way more
costly than anything else and totally
ineffective is uh what we call
fumigation but what in fact is chemical
warfare I've been down to Southern
Columbia and seen some of it it's
chemical warfare which is is driving uh
huge numbers of peasants off their land
destroying their crops Colombia has the
second biggest Refugee problem in the
world after Sudan uh and they're driven
into urban slums and multinational
corporations come in and start Mining
and so on and so forth that's the least
effective and the uh uh most costly and
you know the fact that we do it again if
you can kind of abstract yourself and
pretend you're a martian looking at this
is just kind of UN imaginable I mean the
number of people in Colombia killed by
us tobacco is Way Beyond the number of
Americans killed by Colombian cocaine if
you go to a country like China it's
astronomically more okay do they have a
right to come to the United States and
uh carry out chemical warfare in North
Carolina and Kentucky because uh uh they
have a tobacco problem and it's coming
from here yeah I mean you can't even
speak the words it's so outlandish but
we do it and we think it's just fine you
know even though it's known to be the
least effective uh the most costly uh
and totally immoral as we see right away
if we think of the situation reversed
well that's been going on for decades
that's the War on Drugs uh the use
hasn't affected the use of drugs here at
all uh in fact you know just take a look
at the cost of drugs and availability
barely changed well you know when people
carry out a so-called War for years and
years uh when they know what the
consequences are going to be and they
have plenty of evidence that that's
exactly what the consequences are it has
no effect on drugs a rational person
will begin to ask themselves is this a
War on Drugs okay I mean are they
totally
insane uh is it a war on drugs or is it
a war to
uh in Colombia for example part of a war
of
counterinsurgency uh to clear peasants
off the land so that uh multinational
corporate mining corporations and aggro
business can come in and so on and in
the United States is it a war on drugs
or is it an effort to get rid of uh what
are called the dangerous classes uh
people if you look at the history of
prohibition there good work in legal
history on history of prohibition it's
very typically aimed at what are called
the dangerous classes people who are
kind of getting in our hair so what we
call prohibition you know
uh Banning of alcohol wasn't aimed at U
wealthy people in Westchester County New
York and so on they could do whatever
they liked but it was aimed at
workingclass people and immigrants and
you know the bars and downtown
Manhattan uh marijuana if you look at
the prohibition of marijuana it was not
on medical grounds it was because it was
used by
Mexicans uh and then it was used in the
1920s by blacks and the Harlem r
Renaissance and then of course in the
1930s the Bureau of Narcotics had a big
problem prohibition came in and they had
this huge apparatus and what are they
going to do with it I they had to find
something so okay figure we'll go after
marijuana but the drug of the dangerous
classes if kind of if you look at the
whole in fact this goes back to the 19th
century I mean in 19th century England
uh jyn was uh prohibited but whiskey
wasn't well just take a look at who was
drinking them uh and that runs right
through history these are Wars to
control the dangerous classes uh in fact
the explosion of the War on Drugs here
was in the 1980s and since and during
that period uh uh us
incarceration programs just flew off the
Spectrum I mean back around
1980 the US was sort of slightly at the
high end of industrial societies and per
capita incarceration but within the
Spectrum and now it's five to 10 times
as high as comparable countries not
because there's more crime in fact
crimes remain kind of steady and it's
still relative to other countries what
it was uh and if you take a look at
who's in jail yeah the PE the useless
people black males people who we can't
incorporate in our society this is the
residue of slavery of course you have
different genes uh so yeah they're the
ones we get rid of mean in Latin America
there's a name for it it's called social
cleansing uh the dous classes you send
out the death squads and you kill them
and leave them under the bridge we're
more Humane here so you put them in jail
forever uh and uh the the
imprisonment the it's not just the level
of incarceration but the savagery of it
is just unknown in comparable countries
like Amnesty International did a study a
couple of years ago of uh children in
prison without chance of parole so
permanently permanent uh imp
imprisonment I don't remember the exact
numbers but they they didn't deal with
countries that don't have statistics you
know like Sudan but in the countries
where you know something about what's
going on I think they found something
like maybe 2500 cases and about 2400
were in the United States I mean this
includes cases of you know 12-year-old
kid who happen to be in a room where a a
felony murder was carried out okay he's
in jail for life actually I've seen
cases like this in prison which are well
I say one case just I don't know how
prevalent it is but during the Civil
Rights years I was down in Jackson
Mississippi for demonstration and uh I
was with Howards in and a couple other
people from up here and we designated
ourselves proper self- congratulation as
a New England professor's delegation so
we were escorted through the prison by
the police chief and that sort of thing
and uh
in the prison Jackson Mississippi prison
which is not bad by usual standards I've
been locked up myself in worse prisons
but uh as we were walking down the Halls
we passed one of these huge cages you
know people in the cages and uh they
were all black black men but as we
walked past a a child tapped on the bars
and asked happened to be standing there
asked me if I could get him a drink of
water
so I turned to the police chief and I
said can I get him a drink of water
there's a fountain down the hall so he
said sure So he came over and gave him a
drink of water well when we got back to
the office to talk to the chief we asked
him what's that kid doing in there so he
asked some clerk to look it up and it
turned out that they just found him in
the streets and they didn't know what to
do with him I said they put him in jail
and he'll stay there for the rest of his
life now cases like that are not counted
you know but they they're just part of
the savagery of imprisonment of the
dangerous classes and most you know very
high percentage of people in prison are
drug rated offenses so you find a kid in
Roxbury with a joint in his pocket you
know happens three times okay he's in
jail for who knows how many years has
nothing to do with reducing drugs you
can see that from the statistics but it
does have something to do with purifying
the Society of the people who we find
threatening the dangerous classes
usually people were crushing in one form
or another I don't see any other
rational interpretation of the so-called
War on
Drugs thank you Petra
yeah sorry what do you see as a
connection between the war in bosia and
boming
and do you see any American involvement
in the disintegration
ofia and how do you see the future of
Serb and and the American interests
in well actually the bombing of there's
connection of course between the Balan
Wars the early 90s and the bombing of
Serbia in 1999 but not not a direct
connection with regard to disintegration
of Yugoslavia actually the US role was
not honorable but it wasn't the worst uh
as the US in fact was in favor of uh
maintaining the Integrity of the former
Yugoslavia as incidentally were most
people in the country in polls at that
time uh but it started to split off the
first one to split off was Slovenia okay
that was not a big problem Slovenia is
pretty much part of the West anyway so a
small conflict but nothing much the next
one to split off was Croatia and that
was a big issue because I think about a
third of the population of Croatia is
Serbian and this was then part of
Yugoslavia so when Croatia pulled out uh
the Yugoslav Army uh entered to try to
protect the Integrity of the country and
the Serbian minority well at that point
the main villain was Germany the
German's initiative they Germany wanted
to restore a traditional relationship
with Croatia which is not very pretty if
you have to remember the Second World
War uh but uh they wanted to restore
that and you know kind of reestablish
their position of influence in the
Balkans so they strongly supported
Croatian separation without any rights
for the Serbian minority nothing uh and
they brought the European Union along
with them and so it continued uh Clinton
more oress picked
up the Muslim the bosniac so-call the
Muslim population of Bosnia I suspect
because they just wanted to have a horse
in the race I mean everybody had their
friends were going to pick that one uh
there was a chance for a political
settlement in
1992 the Vance Owen plan uh Clinton
pressured iset kovich the head of the
Muslim Community in Bosnia to rejected
now that was a guarantee of a major war
just a guarantee and after that came a
major war maybe 100,000 people killed
maybe 70,000 of them bosniacs and
finally there was a settlement which is
not very different from the vance oen
plant but it was a settlement that was
carried out at us initiative the Dayton
plant and so the US ends up with a
substantial degree of influence and
control there well that's
1995
uh Serbia was still a problem and the
reason why Serbia was a problem is in
fact described in uh important doc
documents that are known but not
discussed uh the uh there's an important
book by John nris he's a high official
in the state department uh his uh his
Superior immediate Superior was strob
Talbot who was the under Secretary of
State for East European Affairs so the
top guy in the Clinton Administration
dealing with this region uh strob Talbot
in his introduction to the book
says John nars's book is based this is
about kovo he says this book is based on
nars's complete familiarity with all
relevant documents and if you want to
understand the thinking at the highest
level of the Clinton Administration this
is the book you have to read what does
John Norr say take a look he says uh the
bombing of Serbia was not undertaken uh
out of concern for the plight of the
kovar albanians which incidentally we
know from masses of documentation about
what was going on he said it was because
Serbia was not undertaking the required
social andeconomic reforms there kind of
a euphemism to say for saying it's the
last hold out in Europe to our
neoliberal
designs okay according to stroke Talbot
that represents the highest level of
thinking in the Clinton Administration
well quoted it a couple of times and
people have asked to tat and norus about
it and they passionately reject this
description they say oh no that's not
what we thought at all well you know I
don't read their minds that's what they
wrote okay so you can make your own
judgments uh it's all on paper you know
don't take my word for it read it uh and
U I suspect that that's pretty close to
the reason for the bombing of Serbia
they're just not it's like other it's
another reason for believing is is
characteristic of the whole just about
the whole of modern international
relations and for you know with other
countries when they were Britain when
they were the dominant world power you
do not tolerate
Disobedience disobedience is dangerous
it first of you don't want it in the
first place but secondly if somebody's
disobedient somebody else will get the
idea and they'll be disobedient too
that's the virus contagion Theory uh and
uh it just runs through the whole of
great power politics since the second
world war that means mostly the United
States because us has been so dominant
but the same with other powers and in
fact it I I think it
represents I said before that I'm kind
of simple-minded and I think with all
the fancy talk and international
relations Theory there's only one
principle that I know of that seems to
me to have any Merit and that's the
mafia principle international relations
is very much like the mafia uh The
Godfather does not accept Disobedience
and for you know like if a small store
doesn't doesn't matter if it's an
important country or not so suppose some
small storekeeper that doesn't pay his
protection money well The Godfather
doesn't just send out his goons to pick
up the money sends out the coons goons
to beat them to a pulp so that others
will understand the disobedience is not
acceptable uh and we have a rich
documentary record I mentioned a little
of it but there's plenty more uh to show
that that's been a guiding principle of
great power
politics anywhere you look and it's an
understandable principle of course
there's a task of
intellectuals and that's to write
editorials like the one I quoted in the
Boston Globe which is universal I don't
want to dump on them uh our Noble
efforts aren't working so let's try
something else but if you look at the
record it's the mafia principle
successful Defiance you the threat of a
good EX example you got to SM you got to
punish the
population uh and uh I think that's
probably what's involved in Serbia with
regard to Serbia and in fact as Serbia
moves towards you know
accepting the correct social and
economic reforms as they're called
they'll be admitted into polite
Society I mean there's a residue of
antagonism because of the whole you know
huge Outburst of emotion stirred up by
the educ at classes but uh I suppose all
go go in that
direction thank you we have a lot of
people trying to get in all right uh you
were trying to get in from the beginning
and then gentleman back in the white
shirt and then maybe you could take them
in Tandon actually because we don't have
an awful lot of time left and I want to
let as many people in as possible so if
you ask a question and you could ask
yours and then we maybe get quick
respons so my question to the panel is
that there seems to be this idea that
humanitarianism Western and US way of
kind of promoting their own agenda the
bush do c didn't work I mean we have to
tend to Afghanistan and Iraq to see that
President Bush foreign policy it's not
the best and then now we have President
Obama who has extended for his inal
speech to the G20 he exended a very well
walk to the Middle East um to Arab
Nations call Ally Then you have
President pretty much you know not
really responding L as we have so then
what should we do abroad you know we are
being criticized we care about image
abroad but then we don't also want to be
um as aggressive as we've been in the
past so how should we go about dealing
with other nations while maintaining um
our security which is our most primary
concern yeah okay and just before can I
just let this question INE
yeah
devel devel um did you mean that Wasing
to act as a colony United
States yes yeah that's precisely just
take a look back you can read it if you
like it's uh uh well so
just yeah let me mention that since
we're on it uh I was quoting in part
from the internal CIA record about
successful Defiance can't tolerate it
but in part I was just quoting Arthur
Schlesinger's uh report to the incoming
president to President Kennedy when he
was coming in he had a he was going to
turn US policy towards Latin America so
he established a Latin American Mission
and Arthur Schlesinger a very
distinguished historian was the head of
the mission and he presented the report
and his basic conclusion was what I
quoted he said there's a serious the
cast threat that the Castro idea of
taking Affairs into your own hands uh
might spread to other countries uh and
it might appeal to other countries where
people are living with the same
conditions of impoverishment and
repression and you know they might get
the idea of taking Affairs into their
own hands and if this works we're going
to be in trouble because the whole
system of control will evaporate and
this is absolutely standard like right
at the same time uh Kennedy invaded
South Vietnam that's not part of our
official history but it's part of actual
history around the same time time as
this Kennedy sent the US Air Force to
start bombing South Vietnam started
using chemical warfare to destroy foods
and U uh ground cover uh and started
rounding up what turned out to be
millions of people into more or less
concentration camps called strategic
hamlets to protect them from the
gorillas who the US knew perfectly well
they were willingly supporting okay that
we call an invasion if somebody else
does it we call it come here and help us
when we do it uh but uh and this was at
the same time and it was for essentially
the same reasons and we have internal
documents you know they were thinking
along the same lines they said if
Vietnam moves towards
independence uh and is successful it
will be a virus spreading contagion to
others and might spread to Thailand
might even spread to Indonesia which is
important You Know Rich resources and so
on uh and then you know the whole system
whole system of
dominating southeast Asia May erode it
may even lead to the fall of what uh
John Da leading Asian historian called
the super Domino Japan the super Domino
Japan might accommodate to a independent
East Asia becoming its technological
Center if you think back a little that
would have meant that the us would have
lost World War II in the Pacific which
was fought largely to prevent that and
they weren't ready to lose World War II
in 1960 61 so the US did what you're
supposed to do when you have a virus
that's spreading contagion you destroy
the virus and you immunize those who are
you know those who are might be affected
by the contagion so Vietnam was
destroyed no virus uh and the
surrounding countries were protected by
installing vicious brutal dictatorships
which controlled the population and
prevented infection in fact in
retrospect McGeorge Bundy who is the one
of the top advisers for Kennedy and then
Johnson he said we probably should have
stopped the war in
1965 because in
1965 uh General Sarto carried out a
military coup in Indonesia in which they
killed you know who knows maybe a
million people most of them landless
peasants destroyed any possible
independent Force political force and uh
opened up the country completely to
Western exploitation so that Domino was
safe they were not going to be infected
and that was the big one the others
didn't matter so much and the virus
already been destroyed probably should
have stopped then okay that's pretty
much the same thinking as Cuba and as I
mentioned it extends all over the place
uh so those were the reasons and if you
can read about it it's like the schinger
document you can find it on the internet
if you want like if you want to footnote
reference I have it in when I wrote
about it uh the other question was how
do we deal with other countries don't
respond to our gestures of
generosity well first of all we should
ask what the gestures look like from
their point of view okay they have a
point of view so for examp Ahmad is kind
of like a loose cannon but he doesn't
have any foreign policy influence and
control you can talk about this better
than I can but he's uh you know deals
with local affairs
the person in charge is the supreme
leader aah and his response to Obama's
gesture was well we'd like to see some
something
concrete uh and as I said they have a
history we don't our history of US Iran
relations has one event in it namely the
Takeover the embassy their history of US
Iran relations Is much richer I
mentioned some of it uh and uh they look
at affairs from the point of view of the
actual history not our particular
selected event uh and they listen to
Obama and I presume their reaction was
pretty much the same as mine was as I
mentioned here we have maybe you know
the most violent power in the hemisphere
which spends about as much on arms as
the rest of the world combined which
invaded and occupied two countries on
Iran's borders they live with that they
have a tiny military I said size
expenditures about like Kuwait which is
a tiny little country uh and haven't
invaded anybody you know I don't know
for how long centuries I suppose uh how
how would they look at this in fact how
should we look at it is that a real
gesture of U
Hospitality well okay the way we could
deal with it is I I have a feeling of
how we should deal with it I mean it
happens on this matter as on many I
pretty conservative I think we should
take into account US public opinion okay
what's US public opinion the by a large
majority in the United States like about
75% uh the United the population here
agrees with most of the countries in the
world the nonline countries whose voice
is not allowed to be heard but that's
most of the world uh their position is
that uh Iran has and they forcefully
repeated reped it over and over that
Iran has the rights of any sign or the
nonproliferation treaty it it has the
right to develop nuclear energy but not
nuclear
weapons uh so they can enrich uranium
but not for nuclear weapons uh the large
majority of the population here goes
much farther and says that uh we should
EST there should be established a
nuclear weapons free zone in the region
which would include Israel Iran and any
US forces deployed there okay that uh
same with the non- Align countries they
say the same thing and I think that
makes a lot of sense too uh these would
be re and of course I may have mentioned
the same large majority thinks we should
end any threats against Iran now
remember Obama maintains the threats
that's what it means to say all options
are on the table that includes nuclear
bombing or whatever we feel like okay I
think the position of the population
here is pretty sound uh these polls that
I'm reporting from the leading polling
organization in the world about two
years ago they also pulled Iranian
opinion and it turns out that Iranians
and Americans almost completely agree on
these things uh and the when the poll
was presented in a press conference in
Washington by Leading figure Joseph CH
chion he pointed out that if only people
could influence their governments these
issues might be settled you know I I
think that's that's probably true and
with regard to Cuba it's about the same
uh If U our gestures are we're going to
maintain an embargo which as you know
but we're not allowed to know was
established in order to punish you for
Disobedience that's not much of a
gesture thank you our time is actually
up but in the spirit of the seminar I
might and this is our last one I might
just extend our time for another five
minutes I did promise no one might have
out by halfast eight but so many people
have wanted to get in that I might just
take two last Quick comments or
questions and a quick response and then
we call it a day or a night John and
then this lady
here
gentlem balance do you think that US
policy has ever
been
US foreign policies and
then if not is there a structural or
necessary relationship between
incapacity and the messian discourse
that
justifies and is the use of of political
violence in the name of high
ideals discourse always hypoc
hypocritical
by well I I I would there's not much
time to discuss it can I can I just take
this gentleman in with a a quick
question and maybe you can take both of
them yes with the uh financial crash and
the uh questioning of the moral
authority of Western Elites do you see
any opportunities for social movements
From Below to
challenge matters along you know lines
such as drugs
incarceration uh e economic distribution
and and uhv
Etc who is that one two okay so the I
since there isn't really time to discuss
it let me just make a suggestion I I
would suggest that you take your
question and generalize it not to the
United States but to any great power
okay so is the are the politics of any
great power
uh undertaken out of a
an an intention to create the benefit
and you know help the people of the
world I think you know you have to
really look hard to find examples and
the reason is essentially the mafia
principle that I mentioned we have to
extend it uh great power actions don't
take place in a social and economic VA
vacuum they're carried out effectively
by the concentrations of power within
the
society that differs in different
societies like in the old Soviet Union
it was the Kremlin you know party
apparatus in the United States the
corporate sector okay so if you want to
understand uh policies a good place to
look is the interests of those who
formulate them and it's very rare that
they act in the interest of others who
who would expect that and of course the
intellectual classes have to write a
story which says they're always acting
in in the interests of others out of
pure altruism but that's almost
Universal throughout history so we
discount it and we ask what they're
actually doing and yeah sometimes it
happens to be beneficial to others so
takes a humanitarian intervention use of
force in violation of international law
if you take a look at the post World War
II period you can find a few cases where
uh use of force did put an end to Major
atrocities now they don't enter into the
Canon we don't talk about them and the
reason is because of who carried them
out and what the US reaction was the
only two cases I know of of any
significance are the Indian invasion of
uh East Pakistan of Bangladesh in 1971
which did stop huge massacres and the
Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979
which put an end to palat's atrocities
just when they were peing so they had
you know very humane
uh consequences were they humanitarian
interventions no because those weren't
the intentions those were the
consequences but why don't they enter
into the cannon well because it wasn't
us we didn't carry it out rather it was
them and what they do can never be any
good uh furthermore even worse the
United States strongly opposed both of
those interventions it threatened war
with India it sent aircraft carriers
into the Bay of Bengal to threaten them
for this crime in the case of Vietnam I
mean they were just bitterly denounced
for putting paw put's atrocities to an
end the US supported a Chinese Invasion
to punish them for the crime uh and the
us immediately turned to supporting Paul
pot well okay so therefore their
intervention can't count as humanitarian
uh but try to find some other examples
uh so yes there are cases where the use
of force happen to have H benign effects
but not because because it was carried
out with Humane intent and the cases
don't count uh unless we did them when
we did them it either succeeds in
crushing resistance in which case it's
hailed as a great achievement or it
fails in which case we say well it was a
mistake you know our benign intentions
were couldn't be realized that's the
Canon of intellectual history we see it
right now for example so it takes a
Iraq and and take a roughly comparable
example Chia okay uh in
Chia uh uh first yeltz and then Putin
responded to Chen Terror really
significant Cen Terror in Russia with a
vicious Invasion which destroyed the
capital city gry you know killed tens of
thousands of people uh and then
according to us reporters who've been
there it ended up very successful uh New
York Times reporters visiting say grne
is a booming City you know construction
everywhere everybody has electricity you
know no Russian troops around surround
by Chen Security Forces I mean there
some gorillas off in the hill somewhere
we don't call that a success we call it
a crime yeah they succeeded in pacifying
and reconstructing the country and now
it's working pretty well and we consider
it a crime rightly right now let's take
the US invasion of Iraq well you know if
General Petraeus had been able ble to
even minimally approach what Putin
achieved in Chia he'd probably be
crowned
King he hasn't been able to achieve that
but you know so instead of uh you know
it the country survives I mean Baghdad
for example is a gated city which people
can't go from one place to another and
there's been massive ethnic cleansing so
killing has reduced because there's
nobody to kill anymore uh the
uh mil IAS have been armed trained and
funded so they control their territory
so violence is reduced a little the
place is a total wreck there maybe a
million people killed you know couple of
million displaced and refugees but it's
kind of you know violence somewhat
reduced so not as successful as Putin
and chia but you know to some extent
kind
of reduced the level of violence that we
created in the first place and that's
praised ac across the SP Spectrum say
okay the question of uh The Surge let's
say is settled because look how
wonderful it was I mean nowhere near as
wonderful as Putin and chia but uh
nevertheless we did it so it must be
right even if the place has left a total
wreck that may never recover well okay
that's uh the way within our doctrinal
system we look at the use of Violence by
ourselves and others and this translates
to others they do the same thing now is
the use of violence ever permissible
well I'm not an absolute pass an
absolute pacifist would say no I don't
agree but I think there's a very heavy
burden of proof you want to use violence
whether it's a domestic dispute or you
know International Affairs you have a
very heavy burden of proof to meet and I
think if you look carefully it's very
hard to meet that burden and the cases
that are accepted whether it's personal
relations or International Affairs just
don't stand up almost with
exception thank you no could you manage
yeah a one minute response to this man
here well I think it's a possibility you
know that so I mean things have happened
which are really important the uh you
know the ideological basis of the uh
kind of anglo-american financial system
has collapsed uh nobody practically
who's got a brain functioning Now talks
about uh U the efficient market
hypothesis and you know rational
expectations model and all the things
you thought in economics courses because
it totally collapsed as it was bound to
do and it was been pointed out for years
it's got to collapse so it did so it's
hard to reconstruct that
ideology uh does that mean that popular
movements can do something to change the
world yeah it means they can but they're
going to have to do it because power
centers have a very different idea in
mind in fact if you want a good picture
of say what the Obama Administration has
in mind and uh take a look at the
commentary by uh Simon
Johnson very conservative voice former
Chief Economist of the international
monetary fund uh now Economist at MIT
has an article in the Atlantic a couple
of weeks ago Atlantic Monthly and I
think it's pretty accurate that's why
I'm quoting but uh what he says is that
the basically the White House is in the
pocket of the financial
institutions and they're making policy
which is not too surprising because they
were Obama's main supporters during the
campaign and it usually works that way
so they're making policy and their goal
is to maintain the institutional
structure as
is with patching up here and there uh
the uh uh William black who was the
chief regulator at the in the Savings
and Loan crisis you the last major
crisis the Reagan Bush crisis he says
you know most of these guys ought to be
put in jail they're guilty of straight
criminal fraud uh you know Elizabeth
Warren Harvard law professor who's uh
the Congressional monitors said pretty
much the same thing Johnson says you
know we got to take over the banks break
them up so there's no more too big too
big to fail Insurance uh policy and so
on but it's not going to happen as long
as the White House is run by the
financial institutions now does this
give an opening to social movements yeah
I there are alternative possibilities to
what Johnson suggests not just break up
the banks uh and remember there's a uh
there's a similar recession and crisis
in the manufacturing industry serious
one not talk about as much uh but not
just have the government take over the
banks but have the what are called the
stakeholders take them over stakeholders
means the community and the workforce so
they should be running the institutions
whether it's Banks or automobile
companies or whatever that's a
possibility and it's completely
consistent with economic theory in fact
you can look at the mainstream Works in
economics that point out that there's no
law of nature that says that the
management should be responsive to
shareholders they why not to stock
stakeholders and then that raises the
next question why shouldn't the
stakeholders elect the managers and
replace them if they don't like them and
run the things themselves well you know
that's a possibility so there are all
kinds kind of options that are possible
but they're not going to happen by
themselves and they're powerful forces
resisting any change namely the people
who essentially own the country they
wanted to go back to what it was with
them owning the country uh so yeah there
are opportunities but opportunities have
to be
grasped thank you well on that spirited
note
you have already expressed uh your
thanks and I just like to thank you all
for coming
