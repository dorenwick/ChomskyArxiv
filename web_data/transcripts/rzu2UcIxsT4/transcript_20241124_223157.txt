by all indications Lula is the most
popular figure in Brazil and would very
likely be elected in a fair election
it's only fair and appropriate that he
should be permitted to run so that the
Brazilian people can express their own
judgment on his candidacy a century ago
the US analysts described Brazil as the
potential Colossus of the South
corresponding to the Colossus of the
north a mighty realm of limitless
potentialities as the words they used
Brazil has yet to fulfill these
expectations although under Lula's
government with the skillful
participation of his foreign minister
Celso Amorim Brazil did become probably
the most respected actor on the world
stage the potential is very real can be
achieved with major consequences for all
of Latin America and indeed for the
world the current world situation it
cannot fail to recall to mind Antonio
Grumpy's observations on what he called
the time of monsters as the old world is
dying and the new world struggles to be
born Brazil can play a leading role in
the struggle to create a new world of
justice and freedom but to do so it must
fulfill democratic principles and make
sure that the voice of the people is not
stilled
