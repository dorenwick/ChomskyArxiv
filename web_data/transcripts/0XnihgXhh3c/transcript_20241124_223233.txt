all right can everyone hear me all right
welcome everybody please welcome uh
please join me in welcoming president
Bas to the
stage thank you I'm glad to see all of
you here today um I want to first thank
um Professor epard for arranging this
event and extending an invitation to
gome Chomsky when I asked him how did
you get someone of this stature here he
said I just called and I think wow just
reaching out like that can make a a
world of difference and I'm glad each of
you can be here and to hear from someone
who is so distinguished the Concord
University Community is truly honored
and grateful to have Nome Chomsky with
us today if I had unlimited time I would
still not be able to give a proper
introduction to someone as accomplished
as he after all I'm introducing one of
the top 10 most quoted sources in the
humanities a list that includes William
Shakespeare and the Bible with this in
mind and because we're all here today to
listen to him I'm going to be brief
Professor Chomsky is a renowned public
intellectual whose ideas and scholarship
are known the world over he's been
described as one of the most widely
quoted most widely cited and one of the
most influential intellectuals of our
time anyone involved in a serious
exploration of the social problems of
this world must engage with his ideas in
one way or
another in 1955 Professor Chomsky began
teaching at MIT where he is today an
ameritus Institute professor in the
department of linguistics and philosophy
his pioneering work in linguistics
changed the course of research in the
cognitive Sciences before he even
reached the age of
30 professor of linguistics Neil Smith
of London's University College remarked
that Professor Chomsky did for cognitive
science what Galileo did for physical
science Professor Chomsky is tireless
he's an author of over 100 books and a
highly s after speaker at the most
prestigious institutions in the world I
could go on for quite a long time
describing the wonderful career and
critical contributions of Professor
Chomsky but we're all here today to
listen to his words I can't think of a
better person to speak to us on the
topic of poverty and inequality in a
nation of Plenty please join me in
welcoming Nome Chomsky to Concord
University hi hello if we could once
again welcome uh no
Chomsky can you see
me okay let me just adjust the
technology a little bit can you hear and
see
me very well very well okay then I'll
continue maybe your uh your head's a
little bit cut off maybe if you bring
the camera down a little bit we can't
see him how's that uh lower the other
direction
there you go very good okay and maybe
you could turn up your volume a little
bit more because ours is maxed
out I think we can hear you just just
fine we can't quite hear you oh you
can't hear me okay not as well I'll
check on that for
you there some way to get rid of all
this stupid junk well I try but then
this oh I see all right might be able to
double click on that when you try it
with your mouse don't click on the wrong
thing here what'll happen if I say okay
say okay I'm tell you're not giving her
any
information it's going well can you hear
me
now it's the same okay that's okay we'll
try to make out we'll do our best we'll
tell people to shout their questions at
the end so okay thank you um well the
questions that were raised about poverty
and inequality were uh directed
specifically to ourselves to the United
States which of course uh makes perfect
sense but it's worth bearing in mind
that the issues that we're discussing
are not confined to our own country
though the US is a very significant and
in some ways quite shocking example the
same neoliberal policies of the past
generation that are leading to sharply
increasing inequality in the United
States along with uh undermining of
democracy and uh breakdown of social
cohesion have been applied in much of
the world over the past
generation there has uh and there have
been similar effects and weaker
societies often devastating effects
there has also been significant poverty
reduction during this period but rather
strikingly in the countries that have
not accepted the neoliberal principles
that the US and its allies have been
advocating so the greatest progress in
poverty reduction was in China where the
whole system of policies is totally
different and that's rather General as
far as inequality is concerned it's been
growing quite rap rapidly
worldwide uh every year Oxfam leading
development agency publishes a detailed
extensive report of the state of poverty
and inequality in the world in the year
2014 they found that about 90
individuals literally had half of total
world wealth which is an extraordinary
degree of
inequality uh
uh in the year
2015 their latest publication which just
appeared it's the number has been
reduced from 90 to
62 62 individuals hold half the world's
wealth and there are many very ugly
consequences to this to take one example
from the Oxfam
report uh they point out that 5 million
children are dying of starvation every
year that means about 500 or so while
we're meeting 500 children starving
while we're talking and they could very
easily be saved the resources are
certainly there to save them but policy
is designed so that it goes to enriching
the super rich and the powerful not to
saving millions of children from
starvation uh the
there is an organization of the rich
developed countries the
oecd uh the 31 countries uh among the
oecd countries the US is at the extreme
in both inequality and poverty just
quote from the latest OED uh report on
this it says uh the share of top
incomes in the past year increased
especially especially in
English-speaking countries in the United
States far more than others and by a top
incomes they mean the top 1% by now a
fraction of 1% that's where there's been
an explosion of uh uh inequality huge
explosion uh primarily in the United
States also the some extent in other
English-speaking countries uh and uh uh
poverty uh remains at extraordinary
levels with regard to poverty and
inequality uh by most measures uh in the
oecd studies the United States ranks
with the poorest of the 31 countries it
ranks alongside of Mexico and turkey uh
poverty rates and inequality in the
United States are much greater than poor
quite poor European countries like
Portugal and this has been consistent
over 50
years uh the same is true of measures of
soci social
justice that's measures that include
things like infant
mortality hunger and so on of the 31
oecd countries the United States ranks
27th right down to the bottom right
along with Greece only slightly above
Mexico and Chile and turkey
uh
that there is an Associated and quite
striking fact which you perhaps have
read about in the newspapers it's
recently been discovered that among a
sector of the American population a less
educated uh whites mainly white males
that means with only high school
education uh among this large sector of
the American population a life
expectancy is actually declining and
that's something that is unheard of in
Rich societies the life expectancy
continually Rises the United States is
not particularly high in life expectancy
but for the that life expectancy should
reduce among a major sector of the
population less educated white males
that's unheard of uh these are surely
consequence all of this is surely a
consequence of
the neoliberal policies of the past
generation uh deregulation
marketization decline of public
institutions and so on it has led to
General in the United States and similar
things are even worse elsewhere it's led
to stag pretty much stagnation for much
in fact the majority of the population
uh sometimes
decline uh real wages
actual
wages evaluated relative to inflation
real wages for male workers are now at
the level of about the late 1960s
there's been considerable growth but
it's gone into very few Pockets the last
couple of years almost all the growth
has gone into tiny percentage of the
wealth wealthy
population uh the uh so there is in fact
now this radical con conentration of
wealth and not in parts of the
population that are really productive
much of it is in financial institutions
which have a dubious and maybe even
harmful effect on the economy and this
is understood by the
major powerful institutions so for
example couple of years ago City group
one of the major financial institutions
published a report for its for the for
the investors the investors and the City
Group deals with and it urged them to
direct their Investments to what they
call the plutonomy index plutonomy means
the sector of the population the
wealthier sector of the population they
say worldwide incidentally so the
plutonomy is a
worldwide class system of very wealthy
people uh the uh and it says the mostly
in the United States but also some
elsewhere some in China some in Saudi
Arabia and so on but primarily in the
United States that that's where the real
good investment opportunities are you
can kind of disregard the rest they're
not important and in fact it's now a
common to to divide the world's
population into a
plutonomy which is the uh upper sector
of wealth and power uh and the what's
sometimes called the precariat the
people who live precarious lives without
security without benefits uh uh in many
countries including rich countries in
Europe there's the unemployment among
youth is extraordinarily High people are
living at home into their 40s can't
start families get no jobs uh and so
that's the precariat part-time jobs no
no just same in the United states that
take colleges and universities which
increasingly are hiring temporary
workers adjuncts graduate students
people have no protection can be
dismissed easily or paid very little and
that's the precariat uh so the world is
kind of dividing into a plutonomy and a
precariat and as many have pointed out
by now the super rich really inhabit a a
different world a world that barely has
contact with the general population
except to extract resources from them
well there's much debate about the
causes for all of this turns out to be
many complexities but there's ample
evidence that it doesn't have to do with
any economic laws but to largely with
the policy decisions not economic
necessity and uh if you look at the
policy decisions keeping to the United
States now uh we should recognize that
the United States is uh different from
other societies in many ways uh one way
is that it's by far the richest Society
in the world with incomparable
advantages that's been true since it's
founding in fact throughout its history
um the United States has has been the
richest or close to the richest country
in the world by the late 19th century
the US economy was was greater than that
of the other Advanced societies combined
uh 20th century uh uh just accelerated
this I'll come back to
it but though the United that's one
respect in which the and of course the
United States has enormous advantages
huge territory relatively un
underpopulated once the indigenous
population was eliminated or
destroyed enormous internal resources
extraordinary security and so on but
also to an unusual extent the United
States is a business run Society it's
partly the result of the fact that it
didn't grow out of existing feudal
institutions it uh became to a high
extent run by the business world and
that's revealed in many ways so Tak a
voting much on everybody's mind right
now uh the United States has a pretty
high abstention level people who don't
vote and that's been investigated with
interesting results uh one of the
leading Scholars who
studies contemporary electoral politics
Walter Dean Burnham very distinguished
scholar about some years ago did a study
careful study of the socioeconomic
profile of non voters in the United
States and what he discovered is that
their socio economic profile matches
those in Europe similar societies those
in Europe who vote for labor-based or
Social Democratic parties that sector of
the population in the United States just
doesn't vote because uh nothing
represents them there are no such
parties uh just recently
U Dean vernham same scholar and Thomas
Ferguson very prominent political
scientists did a careful very careful
study of voting in the most recent
election
2014 did a careful County bycount study
of just what voting was like and they
came out with a pretty spectacular
conclusion it turned out that voting in
that election was approximately the same
as in the
1820s when the vote was restricted to
property Dwight males
2014 about the same level of voting
which tells you quite a lot about
participation in what's called a
Democratic Society and these results are
Amplified when we look at how people are
represented by their own Representatives
there's a way of studying that it's a
major Topic in uh academic political
science uh you
study the policies that the
representatives vote vote for that's
public and you study the attitudes of
the people who who they represent their
preferences we know a great deal about
that from extensive and quite reliable
and consistent polls and it turns out
that for about 70% of the population the
lower 70% on the income wealth scale
they're basically
disenfranchised their own
representatives vote in ways dissociated
unrelated to their preferences uh as you
move up the income wealth scale you get
a little more influence on
representatives and at the very top
which means really a fraction of 1%
policies are essentially made uh that's
it's very good work on that by Mark
Gillan Larry Bartell other mainstream
political scientists there's a recent
study by Gillan and Benjamin pagee well
known political scientist published at
Princeton University in which they
investigated couple hundred major
decisions that were made and they
compare by the political system and they
compared the decisions with popular
attitude and here's their conclusion
I'll quote it economic Elites mean tiny
fraction of economic power uh economic
Elites and organized groups representing
business interests have substantial
independent impacts on US government
policy while average citizens and
mass-based interest groups have little
or no independent
influence the results provide
substantial support for theories of
economic Elite domination and for
theories of biased pluralism but not for
theories of of majoritarian electoral
democracy or majoritarian pluralism to
decode to the political science rhetoric
uh what it means is in simple words the
United States is a plutocracy with some
formal Democratic elements that are
increasingly at the margins and the
public is aware of that they may not
read people don't have to read the
political science journals to see it in
their lives we see it in much of what's
Happening Now and in fact uh turns out
that policy in
general often is quite contrary to
popular preferences uh studies of
extensive studies of people's attitudes
and even if you study sectors of the
population of the type who say you know
get the government off my back I don't
want to have a government uh even those
sectors turns out that attitude are
pretty much Social
Democratic uh of the the kind that's
missing in American politics so even
among those sectors and in the
population generally there's strong
preference for more spending for uh uh
education uh for health uh for uh not
for welfare welfare has been demonized
primarily by Ronald Reagan with these
Fanci stories about uh you know black
women driving in their limousines to
steal your money at the welfare office
of course nobody wants that but the
things that welfare does namely Aid to
women with dependent children so on
there's very strong support uh one of
the interesting cases is National Health
Care uh Bernie Sanders uh is considered
an extremist because he's calling for
national health care if you look at
polls uh for a long time as far back as
polls have been taken the national
healthc care has been very popular right
now at this moment U about 60% of the
population think we should have National
Health Care it's a pretty remarkable
figure when you recognize that almost no
one speaks for it in public and whatever
it's mentioned it's U demonized
nevertheless U 60 % of the population
think we ought to have it go back a few
years to the Reagan years about 70% of
the population thought that there ought
to be a constitutional guarantee of
National Health of Health Care National
Health Care and indeed about 40% of the
population thought there already was a
constitutional guarantee meaning they
regarded it as such an obvious uh uh
desideratum that it must be in the
Constitution
uh when President Obama came along with
his Affordable Care Act uh there was AR
originally a mention of having a public
option meaning people could choose if
they wanted to have public health care
that was supported by about almost
2third of the population but it was
simply dropped without discussion and as
I say it continues today well coming
back to Sanders uh his advocacy of
National healthc care is considered an
extremist position same of with his
other positions so say free college
tuition and so on these are policies
that would have been that wouldn't have
surprised President Eisenhower in the
1950s his policies are basically
traditional new deal policies of the
kind that even the moderate Republicans
like Eisenhower recognized in the 1950s
and are supported by a large part often
a great majority of the population and
have been for many years but they're
considered extremist for simple reason
the mainstream political Spectrum has
shifted so far to the right that
positions that were mainstream in the
1950s uh now seem to be extremist uh
taxes are a very interesting case there
have been polls about taxes for decades
regular polls uh basically two questions
people are asked uh are your taxes too
high and people say yeah I'd like to pay
less taxes uh are taxes on the rich too
low sure the rich ought to pay much
higher taxes that's consistent and it's
very interest there have been a few
studies which show that when these polls
are reported it's typically the first
question that's reported taxes are too
high not the second question which says
taxes are too low on the wealthy and you
go back to the 1950s the Eisenhower
period taxes on the wealthy were far
higher the top rate was 90% in fact it's
been cut back regularly over the years
in direct opposition to the popular will
uh so by now in fact the poor probably
pay a larger percentage of their income
than the rich in taxes when you consider
the whole array way of largely
regressive taxes State local Social
Security and so on uh that's uh uh these
are all the effects of policy decisions
in recent years which have uh led to the
extreme inequality and the maintenance
of very high levels of poverty uh there
used to be a the 1950s there was a kind
of a quip that the United States is a
onep party state
uh the business party which has two
factions Democrats and Republicans if
you come to today has to be a little
different still a onep party State the
business party as these results as
mentioned to indicate but it doesn't
have two factions anymore there's only
one faction and that faction is not
Democrats it's moderate Republicans who
call themselves Democrats as the
Spectrum has shifted to the right
today's Democratic party is even the
left wing of it like Sanders is running
on Democratic ticket is is very much
like U what the Democrats would have
been even moderate Republicans would
have been in the
1950s uh meanwhile the Republican party
has simply drifted off the Spectrum uh
highly respected U political
commentators conservative political
commentators like like Norman orstein of
the conservative American Enterprise
Institute and simply described today's
Republican party as what they call a
radical
Insurgency which has abandoned
parliamentary politics and uh to be
frank and honest it is literally a
threat to human survival if only because
of its the attitude almost uniform
attitude of the political leadership
those who are running for president
uh on the issue of global warming if
they mean what they say it's almost a
death nail for the species that's not a
small Point well all of this becomes
even more clear if we look over the
history as I mentioned throughout most
perhaps all of its history the United
States has been the richest country in
the world in comparable advantages the
late 19th century richer than other
major economies combined find uh the
20th century was punctuated by
devastating Wars World War I
particularly World War II they destroyed
or devastated us competitors which were
already far behind economically and they
enriched the United States so during the
second World War uh wartime spending
ended the depression that quadrupled
industrial production uh the United
States economically benefited enormous
ly while its other industrial societies
were de seriously harmed or even
destroyed at the end of the war the
United States literally had half of
total world wealth which is Inc
comparable Now That Couldn't remain of
course and over the years it's somewhat
declined as other industrial societies
reconstructed and uh the UN
underdeveloped societies soal began to
develop with Brazil and others uh by
1970 the world was descri the US share
of total World income had reduced to
about
25% which is still enormous but it's not
50% uh roughly the same now the United
States still does have higher per capita
income than Rich European societies but
the main reason for that
is that Americans put in about 20% more
work hours a week over the year than is
done in comparable societies and it's
far from obvious that that's a healthy
or desirable policy Choice uh another
historical pattern of crucial importance
is that over time progress towards
social justice correlates with popular
activism
primarily over time in the labor
movement the
us as a business run Society happens to
have an extremely violent labor history
uh hundreds of workers were being killed
in industrial actions in the United
States well into the
1930s when this nothing like that was
happening at all in comparable societies
back in the late 19th century the labor
movement was extremely powerful uh in
the main industrial centers like say
Western Pennsylvania there were towns
that were simply run by Labor uh
Homestead as one example that meanwhile
it was still mostly an agricultural
country and a radical Farmers movement
developed beginning in Texas then
spreading through Kansas and other areas
the populist movement which had
extremely radical programs they wanted
to free themselves from the control of
Northeastern Bankers Northeastern
Merchants develop their own uh Financial
merch
Cooperative U distributive other systems
the most the most pop the most radical
popular movement in American history uh
was beginning to link up with the work
growing workers movement which was
openly calling for workers to own and
manage their own Factor uh this was
mainstream American
radical populism very few European
inputs it was pretty much crushed by
force uh literally by force uh final
blow was uh woodro Wilson's Red Scare
most severe period of repression in
American history by the uh by the 1920s
of the labor movement had been virtually
destroyed picked up again in the 1930s
popular Uprising CIO organizing labor
militancy synthetic Administration that
led to the New Deal measures which
significantly increased social welfare
and Justice as part of a radical
Democratic uh Uprising throughout much
of the world a lot to say about this
time is running short so I won't go into
the details but there has been a
reaction strong reaction uh ever since
uh the end of the second world war
picking up in the 1970s with the
neoliberal programs uh and the net
effect of it is what we see today uh
policies of deregulation which have led
to regular crisis concentration of
wealth and financial institutions uh uh
uh Bill Clinton's program of destroying
the welfare system ending welfare as we
know it at a
real seriously harmful effect on the
people who need welfare especially women
with the dependent children right now
there are 3 million children in the
United States who are living on less
than $2 a day lots of unskilled labor
which helps uh because there's a work
requirement which drives down wages
there's much else uh there's a kind of a
vicious cycle uh the increase the
concentration of wealth leads to
concentration of political power leads
to policy choices that increase the
concentration of wealth and maintain
poverty poverty now actually as I
mentioned the population is certainly
aware of this but reactions often take
destructive forms in Europe the Centrist
parties are declining uh there's a rise
of uh uh popular movements on both
extremes the Nationalist sometimes Proto
fascist right the Social Democratic left
and here too we see the same thing the
Trump Sanders phenomenon illustrate that
uh could turn into something like the
rise of radical democracy in the 1890s
1930s and 40s with very positive results
setting off a reaction from wealth and
power where could turn into something
else I'll just mention in closing that
I'm old enough to remember the 1930s my
childhood and there was something
similar at that time collapse of the
center rise of popular movements on the
right and the left and it didn't turn
out very nicely I'm old enough to
remember listening to Hitler speeches in
Germany uh and though I couldn't
understand the words there was no
mistaking the fervor of the response and
the passion of the uh delivery and the
reaction to it and we know what came out
of that don't want to draw analogies too
closely but there are things to be
deeply concerned about in the current
situation
thanks I'll stop with
that well now open the floor for uh
question and answers if you could just
uh approach the microphone with your
question can you hear
me my question to you is how do we fix
it do we vote for Sanders definitely not
TR but who do we vote for or what do we
do to me I see voting as the easiest way
to fix these things should we vote and
what should we vote for what else can we
do yeah what can we do yes sir yeah well
in my opinion the decision whether to
vote or not is a pretty simple decision
and it shouldn't take a lot of our time
we if you want my own opinion uh
everything should be done to prevent a
republican Victory the Republican
candidates are extremely dangerous every
single one of them uh just global
warming alone which is one of the huge
problems that the human species faces we
are facing a major problem of uh already
which is plenty of evidence about what's
happening right now and in the near
future it might have devastating
catastrophes a c a person in the White
House who believe who doesn't believe
it's happening or who believes we
shouldn't do anything about it where
takes the positions that the Republican
Congress has been taking is a real
threat to the survival of the species
I'm not even talking about other
policies like the crazed policy of uh bu
of approving torture like Trump building
uh walls to keep out the people we don't
want uh uh carpet bombing the Middle
East Ted Cruz these are astonishing
positions and I think any thing should
be done to prevent that could happen it
would be real really harmful among the
Democrats my own preferences for
Sanders's policies I as I mentioned I
don't think when he's called a radical
extremist I think that's mainly a
comment on how the political spectrum is
shifted he's I to me he looks like a
decent honest New Deal Democrat of not
very different from the
1950s uh but the crucial point which I
think is indicated by your question is
voting is a very small part of what we
should do in my opinion at least the
importance of the Sanders
campaign uh is not only bringing people
out to vote but primarily it would be in
using the momentum that has been created
and the mobilization that has been
created which is pretty remarkable to
form a sustained popular movement which
will not disappear the day after the
election but will remain and will be a
popular Force bringing in other forces
that will compel the kinds of policy
changes that are needed as I mentioned
that's what's happened throughout
history in the
1930s the New Deal measures which did
significantly improve social justice and
Welfare they would not have taken place
if it were not for the active often
militant uh act uh actions of popular
movements in particular the labor
movement but others as well uh political
and other movements they created
conditions under which a partially
sympathetic Administration and even some
corporate supporters were willing to
permit these measures to be implemented
and now that's critically significant
not only for matters of poverty and
inequality of the kind we've been
talking about here which are serious
enough but also because of we have to
recognize that the human
species is now facing questions which
have never Arisen in its history ever we
are facing questions of survival we are
facing the impact of a couple hundred
years of indust
industrialization which have imposed a
extremely harsh conditions on the
environment and if continued will lead
to catastrophe and not in the far
distant future that simply has to be
faced we cannot neglect it now that and
the constant threat of nuclear war which
is very real are shadows overwhelming
almost everything else so we're in a
situ people like you and your cohorts
your age cohorts are in a position where
you have to make choices and decisions
which will affect the possibility of
decent survival decisions of the kind
that have never existed in human history
so what's needed again about the Sanders
campaign my opinion is uh to begin to
act right now not waiting till the
election to create the basis of an
ongoing continuing popular movement
which will press constantly uh
effectively dedicated ways whatever
opportunities there are outside the
electoral system or within it uh to
implement the kinds of choices and
decisions that are necessary for a
decent life and indeed for decent human
survival thank
you hello Dr
chonky uh can you hear me just about
okay uh well I come today asking uh
Bernie Sanders has really uh spoke upon
a crooked campaign financing system I
know uh historic sociologist such as
like C Wright Mill said that um many of
people's social influences come socially
through family connections and other
social ties but as we see with the
politicians agendas being bought do you
would you argue that um possibly a large
amount of social influence actually
comes
economically I didn't hear the
last word would you argue that uh many
of these uh influences that come on to
uh modern day American society comes
economically economically yes oh
overwhelmingly in fact I think uh that
was even clearer from the few things
that I read so take again the uh
gillan's page study that I mentioned
crucial study published by Princeton
University of u a couple of hundred IAL
decisions that were made and what they
point out is that public influence was
almost
zero uh the influence that mattered and
implemented the decisions was from the
business classes the corporate sector
the rich and the powerful and plenty of
other evidence shows the same thing so
your point is exactly right there's
overwhelming influence in fact there's
quite interesting studies I really
suggest you look into them the political
scientist who I mentioned Tom Ferguson
Thomas Ferguson is the has been the
leading student for many years of a very
simple matter the effect of campaign
Finance on political decisions he
studied it way back to the 19th century
and it turns out that simply campaign
funding who's funding the campaign is a
pretty good predictor very close
predictor of the policies that are
implemented that's quite apart from the
other effects of concentration of
economic power which influenced
decisions Case by case goes back to the
19th century it's accelerated in recent
years by now it's out of sight we've
never in the past had elections where
you have to have billions of dollars
even to have a to participate it's
actually pretty remarkable about the
Sanders campaign is it for the first
time he's been able to get around that
just through popular participation but
it's uh it's going to be extremely hard
for him or anyone else to get around it
the concentration of wealth alone and
the enormous uh options that have been
opened up by the Supreme Court
particularly for campaign uh funding
have just radically distorted the
Democratic process so that we are now
literally in a situation where we have a
plutocracy with formal Democratic
elements around the margins and that's
not Graven and stone that can be changed
these are policy decisions different
ones can be
instituted thank
you hello
sir um you've already talked a little
bit about the Trump phenomenon I was
wondering if you could expand a little
on that and tell us some of the
long-term consequences we will have if
Trump is indeed put in office if Trump
is in office yes sir well first we have
to ask U whether he means what he's
saying I don't know and you know I
assume that he means what he's saying if
he does not only we but the human
species is in very deep trouble I'll
come back again to global warming uh
that is a hugely significant
phenomenon I mean we are now in a
situation where the warming of the
planet is proceeding at a level about
maybe a hundred some claim a thousand
times as high as anything in history
that can be checked way back in early
preh long prehuman history nothing
remotely like it see level rise is now
at a level beyond anything that's gone
on for thousands of years uh the effects
of global warming are already extremely
severe uh the uh uh simply in
destruction of species species
destruction now is at the level of 65
million years ago when a huge asteroid
hit the earth and the age of the
dinosaurs a huge destruction of species
that's what's happening right now and
it's
accelerating at the latitude where you
and I live roughly this temperate
latitude uh we are now moving south 10 m
a day just by the average effect of
global warming and that's going to
accelerate these are things with really
lethal consequences now what is the
Republican Party doing Trump in
particular particular uh there was there
was a conference in Paris last uh
December which tried an International
Conference we tried to set some policies
to prevent global warming before it
destroys us it made some progress not
anywhere near enough but the goal was to
uh reach a treaty among the countries of
the world where they would commit
themselves to these measures inadequate
measures but at least some couldn't be
implemented very simple reason the
Republican Congress would not accept it
so therefore there's no treaty just
verbal commitments just a couple of
weeks ago the Republican majority on the
Supreme Court uh sharply violated
precedent to block measures uh limited
measures to reduce uh uh the
extensive pollution from coal plants
well that's a message to the world and
that message is heard saying don't
bother doing anything because the United
States is not going to allow it because
of the Republican party going back to
Trump uh he simply says it's not
happening so I'm not going to do
anything about it that's quite apart
from other policies he's advocated some
of which are really hair raising like
what he said about torture he said fine
let's torture people in fact the kind of
torture that's outlawed by international
law and became an international Scandal
water boarding he says that's the least
of it let's do more uh let's keep all
Muslims out of the country uh let's
build a wall or rather let's get Mexico
to build a wall to prevent people from
fleeing into the United States and where
are they fleeing from incidentally most
of them from Central America where
they're fleeing from the results of our
policies which de severely harmed
Central America time to go to the
details and we go through the rest of it
it's pretty frightening that's why the
world is frightened I mean long before
this couple of years before this uh the
uh Global opinion regarded the United
States as the greatest threat to World
Peace uh
that's Gallop pole American run poll
show that the world has regarded the us
as the gravest threat to World Peace by
a large margin incidentally the
Americans don't know about this because
it wasn't reported here though it should
have been right now the spectacle of the
Republican primaries is frightening
people around the world
justifiably uh the
forces you can kind of comprehend the
reasons why uh people are flocking to
Trump's Banner these are the classes of
people for whom uh uh death rates
mortality is actually increasing uh they
see themselves as having their lives
taken away from them their dignity taken
away the possibilities for the future to
taken away so they're rallying behind
that Banner things like that have
happened before in the past and as I
mentioned the outcomes were not pretty
so I think that's
uh what we can fairly
anticipate now not entirely because he's
kind of a wild card he says all sorts of
things some of them make sense some of
them are crazy it's hard to know what he
means but you know the US is an
extremely powerful State uh to have
somebody who's a kind of a wild man uh
with his finger on the button that could
destroy the world namely the nuclear
weapons button where it could make
decisions of enormous influence I think
is a very frightening Prospect although
you want the truth my own feeling is
that his main competitor Ted Cruz is
even more
dangerous thank
you hello and let me say that it's an
honor to be able to talk to you uh it
can't be uh argued that we come from the
most or one of the most e economically
depressed areas in the United States and
that we as Concord college students are
poor college students so my question is
kind of twofold
first our government abuses us as poor
college students the people who are
making policies they don't think about
us so why haven't we emulated our peers
around the world in making effective
change
and then secondly if we make this change
what role do we as Concord students play
in this change what should we
do well um it's worth bearing in mind
that people like you today's college
students uh happen to be in a unusually
privileged position the reason is that
there have been with all the problems of
the country I've mentioned them you know
many more there's also been considerable
progress quite considerable progress uh
I don't know what coner University was
like 50 years ago but I know what many
other universities were like including
my own so take MIT where I am the
greatest science engineering institution
in the world and when I got here in the
1950s the student body consisted of uh
white males well dressed
differential uh doing their homework not
asking too many questions that was MIT
in the
1950s you walk around the HS today and
you see something totally different half
women third
minorities uh informal dress which is
not just symbolic it indicates
informal um personal relations student
faculty a lot of interaction a lot of
student AC ISM of all kinds including
many of the issues that I mentioned none
of this existed in the past those those
and that's happening everywhere I
presume it happens in your college as
well uh that's the there has been very
considerable progress in gaining rights
and creating opportunities that means
you can do all sorts of things
that that that that are benefit from the
legacy of the activism of young people
students in the past generation and you
can go on from there and all the options
are open uh electoral although as I said
those are should be probably a small
part uh but uh all kinds of or of uh
activism and uh ranging from
demonstrations to political pressure to
organizing Freer institutions to
supporting
U for example worker own Rises
cooperatives uh all sorts of
opportunities are available uh far more
than in the past what's missing really
is the will the will to make use of the
opportunities and that's pretty much in
your hands uh nobody can do it for you
and the consequences are of enormous
import not only in your lives lives of
your children grandchildren but for the
entire
world thank you
hello Mr chsky thank you for visiting us
today um I'm a former student a graduate
of Concord and I'm currently an Adjunct
professor and I was wondering um how
Concord can build Bridges between the
universities in the area and the
communities I'm sorry I hear the last um
how can Concord University build better
Bridges between the communities and this
the area schools between the commun how
can conquered University build better
Bridges to the
communities and uh the surrounding
communities and other colleges that's
correct sir well I think there are lots
of ways so for example uh U if you take
a look at even the things that have been
done in the
past students particularly sometimes
with faculty support have tried to open
student
unions the facilities in the college to
the community to sectors of the
community that are deprived of the
opportunities that the colleges and
universities offer uh that would mean uh
courses seminars training uh sending
people out to help uh to work in
schools involvement with Community
organizations uh whatever problems the
local communities are facing whether
it's uh you know getting a traffic light
at an intersection where kids have to
cross the street or hunger or these uh
people living on less than $2 a day and
so on students and faculty can do all
sorts of things to not only participate
in their actions but to open the
facilities of the university to them the
universities are basically privileged
sectors in uh in a broader society that
has has great needs and the Outreach
that uh can uh develop Within These
privilege sectors can be very
significant in many ways lots of such
initiatives have been uh tried and often
very successfully and that can be
extended
considerably thank
you we promised uh Professor Chomsky we
keep him for one hour so I think we have
time for one more question I really
really apologize here
good afternoon Dr Chomsky um oh my
question is kind of two-part two can you
hear
me
almost okay go ahead if individuals with
humble upbringings are being used as
resources as I think you said earlier
and the popular consensus is generally
being ignored by policy makers and those
in government offices how do we as a
nation make any policy change in favor
of a less diverse social and economic
class whilst in the middle of a sixth
Extinction while in the midst of the
sixth Extinction sixth Extinction I
didn't hear the last few words I'm sorry
what kind of Extinction it's kind of a
tongue twister the sixth Extinction oh
the sixth Extinction yeah well that's
not a joke that's you're referring to
the uh level of species Extinction
that's happening now correct that's as I
said 65 million years ago it was an
asteroid right now we're the asteroid
it's our actions that are bringing this
about and they have to be changed there
has to be a significant move towards uh
replacing Reliance on fossil fuels which
are D very destructive of the
environment with sustainable energy also
conservation practices uh all of this
can be done in fact it is being done in
other places like take say Denmark
Denmark is an advanced industrial
society quite wealthy better off than us
in many respects and it's virtually on
sustainable energy at this point uh
within the United States the state of
Hawaii is pretty close to coming to
sustainable energy Germany which is uh
the most
successful roughly capitalist economy in
the world is moving effective ly towards
sustainable energy uh maybe another few
decades we can do far more in developing
uh developing simply in research and
development than manufacturing and
production so why should the center for
development of advanced social panel
solar panels why should it be in China
why not here we have far more resources
uh a far more educational cultural
scientific economic resources it's
scandalous that it shouldn't be here we
should be doing it for the world not
taking it from the world uh things like
simple just take
Transportation United States is a
extraordinarily inefficient
transportation system and we're about
one of the few countries in the world
where you can't take a high-speed train
uh there's an enormous amount that has
to be done enormous amount of work that
has to be done simply to create an
efficient transportation system uh
rather than the system that we have
which maximizes uh the use of
destructive fossil fuels uh we can go on
and on you just say weatherization of
homes just turning homes into places
that are do not waste energy but save it
plenty of ways to do that enormous
amount of work that could be done
there's plenty of people in the United
States without without jobs people talk
about a low unemployment figure but
that's mostly a a joke the speak the
figure is low because so many people
have dropped out of the job market if
you look at the ratio of employable
people to employment it's quite low and
that's not because those people don't
want to work they do tremendous amount
of work to be done plenty vital hands
willing to do it huge
resources uh the system is so
inefficient it can't put them together
uh there are plenty of idle resources
that can be used uh you take a look at
discretionary funding in Congress almost
all of it goes to the military budget
who's that helping it's harming in fact
can be sharply cut back right now uh
Obama has a trillion doll program to
modernize and and expand nuclear weapons
should be going in the opposite
direction of uh take the Health Care
system in the United States which
Sanders is talking about the US Health
Care Systems an international Scandal it
has more than twice the per capita costs
of comparable countries has some of the
worst
outcomes reason why it's largely
privatized very inefficient high levels
of bureaucracy huge administrative costs
in the hands of Institutions that are
interested in profit not Health doesn't
it it's not utopian to say that we
should follow the will of the majority
of the population and develop a system
of the kind that comparable countries
have freeing up huge amounts of
resources in fact it would pretty much
eliminate the deficit all of these
things are perfectly feasible and you
can think of plenty more and they have
to be done uh otherwise the sixth
Extinction that you mentioned will
extend to us as
well thank you I apologize we actually
promised we let Professor Chomsky go if
you check the bookstore this week some
of his books will be available he has a
new film coming out called rum for the
American dream um please join me in
giving him a a warm thank
[Applause]
you
