when I was thinking about these remarks
I had two topics in mind couldn't decide
between them actually pretty obvious
ones one topic is what are the most
important issues that we Face uh the
second topic is uh what issues are not
being treated seriously or at all in the
uh quadrennial frenzy now underway
called an election uh but I realized
that there's no problem it's not a hard
Choice they're the same topic and there
are reasons for it which are very
significant in themselves I'd like to
return to that in a moment but uh first
a few words on the background beginning
with the announced title who owns the
world actually a good answer to this was
given Years Ago by
Adam
Smith uh someone we're supposed to
worship but not read he was uh it's a
little subversive when you read him
sometimes he was referring to the most
powerful country in the world in his day
and of course the country that
interested him uh namely England and he
pointed out that in England the
principal architects of policy are those
who own the country uh the merch merchs
and manufacturers in his day and he said
they make sure to design policy so that
their own interests are uh most
peculiarly attended to their interests
are served by policy however Grievous
the impact on others including the
people of England but uh he was an
old-fashioned conservative with moral
principles so he added the victims of
England the Vic victims of the what do
you call the Savage Injustice of the
Europeans particularly in
India uh well he he had no Illusions
about the Hors so to quote him again uh
all for ourselves and nothing for other
people seems in every age of the world
to have been the vile maxim of the
Masters of man kind was true then it's
true now uh Britain kept its position as
the dominant world power well into the
20th century despite steady decline uh
by the end of World War II dominance had
shifted decisively into the hands of the
upstart across the sea the United States
by far the most powerful and Wealthy
Society in world history uh Britain
could only aspire to be its Junior
partner as the British foreign office
ruly recognized at that point
1945 the United States had literally
half the world's wealth uh incredible
security uh controlled the entire
Western Hemisphere both oceans the
opposite sides of both oceans is nothing
but there has never been anything like
that in history and planners understood
it Roosevelt's planners were meeting
right through the Second World War uh
designing the post-war World they were
quite sophisticated about it and their
plans were pretty much implemented uh
they wanted to make sure that the United
States would control what they called a
grand area which would include routinely
the entire Western Hemisphere uh the
entire Far East the former British
Empire which US would be taking over and
as much of Eurasia Asia as possible
crucially its commercial and Industrial
centers in Western Europe and within
this region they said the United States
should um hold unquestioned power with
military and economic Supremacy while
ensuring the limitation of any exercise
of sovereignty by states that might
interfere with these Global designs and
those were pretty realistic plans at
time given the enormous disparity of
power uh the US had been the by far the
richest country in the world even before
the second world war although it wasn't
was not yet the major Global actor uh it
during the second world war the United
States gained enormously industrial
production almost quadrupled got us out
of depression and meanwhile industrial
Rivals were devastated or serious
weakened so that was an unbelievable
system of power actually the policies
that were outlined then still hold you
can read them in government
pronouncements but the capacity to
implement them has significantly
declined actually there's a major theme
now in foreign policy discussion you
know journals and so on the theme is
called American decline so for example
in the most prestigious establishment in
international relations Journal Foreign
Affairs couple of months ago there was
an issue which had on the front cover
and big bold letters uh is America over
question mark That's announcing the
theme of the
issue and there's a standard col
corollary to this that power is
Shifting uh to the west to China and
India the rising world powers which are
going to be the hent monic state states
of the future actually I think the
decline the decline is quite real but
some serious qualifications are in order
first of all the cor are is highly
unlikely at least in the foreseeable
future China and India are very poor
countries uh just take a look at say the
human development index of the United
Nations they're way down there China's
around 90th I think India's around 120th
or so like last time I looked uh and
they have tremendous internal problems
demographic problems extreme poverty
hopess inequality ecological problems
China's great manufacturing center but
it's actually mostly an assembly plant
so it assembles uh parts and components
high technology that comes from the
surrounding industrial more advanced
industrial centers Japan Taiwan South
Korea Singapore the United States Europe
it basically assembles them so if say
you buy a one of these eye things you
know an iPad from China that it's called
an export from China but the parts and
components and Technology come from
outside and the value added in China is
minuscule it's been calculated they'll
move up the technology ladder but it's a
hard climb in the even harder uh well
so I I think one should be skeptical
about the carer but the there's another
qualification that's more serious the
decline is real but it's not new it's
been going on since
1945 uh in fact it happened very quickly
in the late 1940s there's an event
that's known here as the loss of China
China became independent that's a loss
of a huge piece of the grand area of
Asia uh and it became a major issue in
American domestic policy who's
responsible for the loss of China a lot
of recriminations and so on actually the
phrase is kind of interesting like I
can't lose your computer right because I
don't own it uh I can lose my computer
well the phrase loss of China kind of
presupposes a deeply held principle of
uh kind of American Elite Consciousness
we own the world and if some piece of it
becomes independent we've lost it and
that's a terrible loss we got to do
something about it it's it's never
questioned uh which is interesting in
itself well right about the same time
around 1950 concerns developed about the
loss of Southeast Asia and that's what
led the United States into the Indochina
Wars the worst atrocities of the postwar
period uh partly lost partly not very
significant event in modern history was
in
1965 when uh the in Indonesia which was
the main concern that's the country of
Southeast Asia with most of the wealth
and resources uh there was a CP military
coup in Indonesia it uh suaro coup it
led to an extraordinary Massacre with
the New York Times called a staggering
Mass Slaughter that killed hundreds of
thousands of people mostly landless
peasants destroyed the only Mass
political party and opened the country
up to Western
exploitation uh Euphoria in the West Was
So enormous that it couldn't be
contained so in the New York Times
describing the Staggering Mass Slaughter
it called it a gleam of light in Asia
that was the column written by James
Reston the leading liberal thinker in
the times and the same elsewhere Europe
Australia was fantastic event uh years
later MC George Bundy who was the
National Security adviser for Kennedy
and Johnson in retrospect he pointed out
that uh probably would have been a good
idea to end the Vietnam War at that
point to pull out contrary to a lot of
Illusions the Vietnam War was fought
primarily to ensure that an independent
Vietnam would not develop successfully
and become a model for other countries
in the region I would not to borrow
Henry Kissinger's terminology speaking
about Chile we have to prevent it the
what they called the what he called the
virus of independent development from
spreading contagion elsewhere that's a
critical part of American foreign policy
since the Second World War War Britain
France others to a lesser degree uh and
by 1965 that was over uh Vietnam was
South Vietnam was virtually destroyed a
war it spread to the rest of and China
wasn't going to be a model for anyone
and the contagion was contained uh there
were the Sara regime made sure that
Indonesia wouldn't be infected and
pretty soon the US had dictatorships in
every country of the region Marcos in
the Philippines dictatorship in Thailand
Shon in South Park and South Korea it
was no problem about the infection so
that would have been a good time to end
the Vietnam War he felt well that's
southeast Asia uh but the decline
continues uh the last 10 years there
been a very important event uh the loss
of South America for the first time in
500 years the South since the
Conquistadors the South American
countries have begun to move towards
independence and a degree of
integration the typical structure of one
of the South American countries was a
tiny very rich westernized Elite often
white or mostly white and a huge mass of
horrible poverty countries separated
from one another oriented to each
oriented towards it's you know either
Europe or more recently the United
States last 10 years that's been
overcome significantly beginning to
integrate prerequisite for Independence
even beginning to face some of their
horrendous internal problems that's the
loss of South America One sign is that
the United States has been driven out of
every single military base in South
America trying to restore a few but
right now there are none well moving on
uh to just last year the Arab Spring uh
is another such threat it threatens to
take that big region uh out of the grand
area that's a lot more significant than
southeast Asia or South America you go
back to the 1940s the state department
recognized that uh the energy resources
of the Middle East are what they called
the one of the Great material prizes in
world history a spectacular source of
strategic power if we can control Middle
East energy we can control the world
take a look at the US UK British coup in
Iran in
1953 very important event it's shadow
cast over the world until today that was
was a pretense that it was part of the
Cold War had nothing to do with cold
Cold War uh what it had to do was the
usual fear independent nationalism and
wasn't even concerned with uh uh access
to oil or profits it was concerned with
control control of the oil resources of
Iran and in fact of the region and
that's a theme that runs right through
policy decisions not discussed much but
uh it's very important to have control
exactly as state Department pointed
advisers pointed out in the' 40s if you
can control the oil you can control most
of the world and that goes on uh so far
the threat of the Arab Spring has been
pretty well contained uh in the oil
dictatorships which are the most
important ones for the West uh every
effort to join the Arab Spring has just
been crushed by force Saudi Arabia was
so extreme that uh when there was an
effort to
you know go out into the streets the
security presence was so enormous that
people were even afraid to go out
there's a little discussion of what goes
on in Bahrain where it's been crushed
but Eastern Saudi Arabia was much worse
the Emirates totally controlled so
that's okay we managed to ensure that
the threat of democracy would be uh
smashed in the most important places
Egypt is an interesting case uh it's
important country not oil producer it is
a small one but uh in Egypt the United
States followed a standard operating
procedure uh any of you're going into
the Diplomatic service you might as well
learn it there's a standard procedure
when one of your favor dictators gets
into trouble uh first you support him as
long as possible uh but if it becomes
really impossible say the Army turns
against him then you send him out to
pasture and uh get get the intellectual
class to issue ringing declarations
about your love of democracy and then
try to restore the old system as much as
possible there's case after case of that
samoza in
Nicaragua duela in Haiti marus in the
Philippines chuna in South Korea Mutu in
the
Congo over and over I me it takes genius
not to see it and it's exactly what was
done in uh in Egypt and what France
tried to do not quite with as much
success in Tunisia well the future is
uncertain but the threat of democracy so
far is contained and it's a real threat
I'll return to that it's also to recog
important to recognize that the decline
over the past 50 years is to a
significant extent self-inflicted
particularly since the 70s I'll come
back to that too but first let me say a
couple of things about the issues that
are most important today today and that
are being ignored or not dealt seriously
dealt with seriously in the Electoral
campaigns for good reasons so let me
start with the most important issues
there are two of these there of
overwhelming significance because the
fate of the species depends on them one
is environmental disaster the other is
nuclear war I'm not going to take much
time reviewing the threats of
Environmental disaster actually they're
on the front pages almost daily so for
example last week the New York Times had
a front page story with the headline
ending its summer melt Arctic sea ice
sets a new low that leads to warnings uh
the melting this summer was fast far
faster than was predicted by the
sophisticated computer models and the
most recent United Nations report it's
now predicted that the summer ice it
might be gone by 2020 it was assumed
before that it maybe
2050 uh they quoted scientists who said
this is a prime example of the built-in
conservatism of our climate forcasts as
dire the warnings are about the
long-term consequences of heat trapping
emissions uh many of us fear that they
may still be un underestimating the
speed and severity of the impending
changes actually there's a climate
change study program at MIT where I am
they've been warning about this for
years and repeatedly have been proven
right uh the Times report discusses
briefly the severe attack the severe
impact of all of this on the global
climate and it adds but governments have
not responded to the change with any
greater urgency about limiting
Greenhouse emissions
to the contrary their main response has
been to plan for exploitation of newly
accessible minerals in the Arctic
including drilling for more oil that is
to accelerate the
catastrophe that's quite interesting it
demonstrates an extraordinary
willingness to sacrifice the lives of
our children and Grand children for
short-term gain or perhaps an equally
REM remarkable willingness to shut our
eyes so as not to see uh impending Peril
there things you sometimes find with
young infants something looks dangerous
close my eyes won't look at it uh well
there is another possibility I mean
maybe humans are somehow trying to
fulfill a prediction of Great American
biologist who died recently Ernst Meyer
he argued years ago that uh
intelligence seems to be a lethal
mutation uh he and he had some pretty
good evidence there's a notion of
biological success which is how many of
you are there around you know that's
biological success he pointed out that
if you look at the tens of billions of
species in human in world history U the
ones that are very successful are the
ones that mutate very quickly like
bacteria or the ones that have a fixed
ecological niche like beetles that they
seem to make out fine but as you move up
the scale of what we call intelligence
success declines steadily when you get
up to mammals it's very low there very
few of them around and there's a lot of
cows it's only because we domesticate
them uh when you get to humans it's the
same till very recently much too reent
time to show up in the any evolutionary
accounting the humans were very
scattered there were plenty of other
hominids but they disappeared probably
because humans exterminated them but
nobody knows for sure uh anyhow maybe
we're try trying to show that uh humans
just fit into the general pattern uh we
can exterminate ourselves too the rest
of the world with us and we're hellbent
on it right now well let's turn to the
uh elections both political parties
demand that we make the problem worse uh
in 2008 both party flat platforms
devoted some space to how the government
should address climate change uh today
the in the Republican platform the issue
is essentially
disappeared but the platform does demand
that Congress take quick action to
prevent the Environmental Protection
Agency from regulating greenhouse gases
so let's make sure to make it worse and
it also demands that uh we open the
Alaska's Arctic Refuge to drilling I'm
quoting now in order to take advantage
of all of our American god-given
resources you can't disobey God after
all uh on Environmental Policy uh the
program says we must restore scientific
Integrity to our public research
institutions and remove political
incentives from public publicly funded
research all of that's a code word for
climate science stop funding climate
science uh Romney himself says there's
no scientific consensus so we should
support more debate and
investigation within the scientific
Community but no action except to act to
make the problems worse well what about
the Democrat uh they concede that
there's a problem and uh Advocate that
we should work toward an agreement to
set emissions limits in unison with
other emerging Powers but that's it no
action and in fact as Obama has
emphasized uh we have to work hard to
gain what he calls a 100 Years of energy
independence by exploiting uh domestic
uh or Canadian Resources by fracking and
other elaborate Technologies doesn't ask
what the world will look like in a 100
years so there are differences the
differences are basically about how
enthusiastically the Lemmings should
March towards the
cliff uh it's turn to the second major
issue nuclear war it's also on the front
pages daily but in a way that would seem
outlandish to some independent Observer
viewing what's going on on Earth and in
fact does seem outlandish to a
considerable majority of the countries
of the world the current threat not for
the first time is in the Middle East
focusing on Iran the general picture in
the west is very clear it's far too
dangerous uh to allow Iran to reach
what's called nuclear
capability that is the capability
enjoyed by many Powers dozens of them to
produce nuclear weapons if they decide
to do so
as to whether they've decided us
intelligence says it doesn't know the U
International atomic energy agency just
produced its most recent report a couple
weeks ago and it concludes I'll quote it
it cannot demonstrate the absence of an
Undeclared of Undeclared nuclear
material and activities in Iran uh that
is it can't demonstrate something which
cannot a condition that can't be
satisfied there's no way to demonstrate
the absence of the work that's
convenient now therefore Iran must be
denied the right to enrich uranium
that's guaranteed to every Power that
signed the nonproliferation treaty well
that's the picture in the west that's
not the picture in the rest of the world
as you know I'm sure there was just a
meeting of the
non-aligned uh movement that large major
vary of the countries in the world and
of representing most of the world's
population of meeting in Teran and once
again not for the first time they issued
a ringing Declaration of support for
Iran's right to enrich uh uranium right
that every country has that uh signed
the nonproliferation treaty uh pretty
much the same is true in the Arab world
it's interesting I'll return to that in
a moment uh there is a basic reason for
the concern it was expressed succinctly
by General Lee Butler he's the former
head of the US strategic command which
controls nuclear weapons and nuclear
strategy he wrote that it is dangerous
in the extreme that in The Cauldron of
animosities that we call the Middle East
One Nation should arm itself with
nuclear weapons which may Inspire other
nations to do
so uh General Butler however was not
referring to Iran he was referring to
Israel uh the country that ranks highest
in European polls as the most dangerous
country in the world right above Iran
and not incidentally in the Arab world
where the public regard the United
States as the second most dangerous
country right after Israel uh in the
Arab world Iran though disliked it ranks
far lower as a threat uh among the
populations that is not the
dictatorships uh with regard to Iranian
nuclear weapons nobody wants them to
have them but uh in many polls
majorities sometimes considerable
majorities have said that the region
would be more secure if Iran had nuclear
weapons to balance those of their major
threats now there's a lot of commentary
in the western media uh journals about
uh Arab attitudes towards Iran and what
you read commonly is that the Arabs want
decisive action against Iran which is
true of the dictators it's not true of
the populations but who cares about the
populations what are called
disparagingly the Arab Street I don't
care about them uh that's a reflection
of the extremely deep contempt for
democracy among Western Elites I mean so
deep that it can't be perceived you know
it's just kind of like reflects it
uh the study of popular attitudes in the
Arab world and there is very extensive
study by Western polling agencies it
reveals very quickly why the US and its
allies are so concerned about the threat
of democracy and are doing what they can
to prevent it take they certainly don't
want attitudes like those are just
indicated to be become policy while of
course issuing ing statements about our
passionate dedication to democracy those
are relayed obediently by reporters and
commentators well unlike Iran Israel
refuses to allow inspections at all
refuses to join the nonproliferation
treaty has hundreds of nuclear weapons
has advanced Delivery Systems also it
has a long record of violence and
repression it has annexed and settled
conquered territories
illegally violation of Security Council
orders uh many acts of aggression five
times against Lebanon alone no credible
pretext uh New York Times yesterday you
can read that the Golan Heights uh are
disputed territory Syrian Golan Heights
there is a un Security Council
resolution 497 which is unanimous
declaring Israel's annexation of the
Golan Heights illegal and demanding that
it be rescinded and in fact it's
disputed only in Israel and in the New
York Times which in fact is reflecting
actual US policy not formal US
policy Iran has a record of aggression
too uh it uh in the last several hundred
years it has invaded and conquered a
couple of Arab islands and that was
under the Sha us imposed dictator with
us support Court that's actually the
only case in several hundred years uh
meanwhile the severe threats of attack
continue you've just been hearing them
at the UN from the United States but
particularly Israel now there is a
reaction to this at the highest level in
the United States Leon Panetta uh
Secretary of Defense he said that we
don't want uh to attack Iran we hope
that Israel won't attack Iran
but Israel is a sovereign country and
they have to make their own decisions
about what they'll do uh you might ask
what the reaction would be if you
reverse the cast of characters and those
of you who have antiquarian interests
and might remember that there's a
document called the United Nations
Charter Foundation of modern
international law which bars the threat
or use of force in international affairs
there are two Rogue States United States
and Israel uh which for whom which
regard the the charter and international
law is just a boring irrelevance so do
what they like and that's
accepted uh well these are not just
words there is an ongoing
War includes terrorism assassination of
nuclear scientists includes economic War
uh us threats not International ones us
threats have cut Iran out of the
International Financial system uh
Western military analysts identify what
they call weapons of Finance as acts of
war that justify violent response when
they're directed against us that is
cutting Iran out of global financial
markets is different the United States
is openly carrying out extensive cyber
war against Iran that praised the
Pentagon regards cyber War as an
equivalent to an armed attack which
justifies military response but that's
of course when it's directed against us
the leading liberal figure in the state
department Harold Co is the top state
department legal advisor uh he says that
cyber war is an active War if it results
in significant destruction like the
attack acts against Iranian nuclear
facilities and such acts he says justify
force in
selfdefense but of course he means only
attacks against the United States or its
clients well Israel's lethal Armory
which is enormous uh includes Advanced
submarines recently provided by
Germany the these are capable of
carrying uh Israel's nuclear tipped
missiles and the these are sure to be
deployed in the Persian Gulf or nearby
if Israel proceeds with its plans to
bomb Iran or more likely I suspect to
try to set up conditions in which the
United States will do so and the United
States of course has a vast array of
nuclear weapons all over the world but
surrounding the region from the
Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean
including enough Firepower in the
Persian Gulf to destroy most of the
world
uh another story that's in the news
right now is uh the Israeli bombing of
the Iraqi reactor in osirak which is
suggested as a model for Israeli bombing
of Iran it's rarely mentioned however
that the bombing of the osirak reactor
didn't end Saddam Hussein's nuclear
weapons program it initiated it there
was no program before it and the oser
reactor was not capable of producing
uranium for nuclear weapons but of
course after the bombing Sadam
immediately turned to developing a
nuclear weapons program and if Iran is
bombed it's almost certain to proceed
just as Saddam Hussein did after the
occk bombing well in a few weeks we'll
be commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the most dangerous moment in human
history those are the words of historian
Kennedy advisor Arthur Schlesinger is
referring of course to the October 1962
Missile Crisis the most dangerous moment
in human history others agree at that
time Kennedy raised the nuclear alert to
the second highest level just short of
launching weapons uh he authorized NATO
aircraft with Turkish or other Pilots to
take off fly to Moscow and drop bombs
setting off a likely nuclear
configration at the peak of the Missile
Crisis Kennedy estimated the probability
of nuclear war at perhaps
50% it's a war that would destroy the
Northern Hemisphere President Eisenhower
had warned and facing that risk Kennedy
refused to agree publicly to an offer by
uh her chuff to end the crisis by
simultaneous withdrawal of Russian
missiles from Cuba and US missiles from
Turkey these were obsolete missiles they
were already being replaced by
invulnerable Polaris submarines but it
was felt
necessary uh to firmly establish the
principle that Russia has no right to
have any offensive weapons anywhere
Beyond the borders of the
USSR even to defend an ally against us
attack that's now recognized to be the
prime reason for deploying missiles
there and actually a plausible one uh
meanwhile the United States must retain
the right to have them all over the
world targeting Russia or China or any
other enemy in fact in
1962 the United we've just recently
learned the United States had
just secretly deployed nuclear missiles
to
okanawa aimed at China it was a moment
of elevated Regional tensions all of
that is very consistent with grand
area conceptions the ones I mentioned
that were developed by Roosevelt's
planners well fortunately in 1962 Kush
shiff backed down but the world can't be
assured of such sanity forever and
particularly threatening my view is that
intellectual opinion and even
scholarship a haale Kennedy's Behavior
as his finest
Hour my own view is is one of the worst
moments in history uh inability to face
the truth about ourselves is all too
common a feature of the intellectual
culture also personal life has ominous
implications well 10 years later uh in
1973 during the Israel Arab War
Henry Kissinger called a highlevel
nuclear alert uh the purpose was to warn
the Russians to keep hands off while he
was so we have recently learned he was
secretly informing Israel that they were
authorized to violate the ceasefire that
had been imposed jointly by the US and
Russia when Reagan came into office a
couple years later uh the United States
launched operations probing russan ran
defenses flying into Russia to probe
defenses and simulating air and Naval
attacks and meanwhile placing persing
missiles in Germany that had a five
minute flight time to Russian targets
they were providing what the CIA called
a super sudden First Strike
capability the Russians not surprisingly
were deeply concerned actually that led
to a major war scare in
1983 uh there have been hundreds of
cases when human intervention aborted a
first strike uh launch just minutes
before launch that's after automated
systems gave false alarms and we don't
have Russian records but there's no
doubt that their systems are far more
accident prone actually it's a near
miracle that nuclear war has been
avoided so far uh meanwhile India and
Pakistan have come close to nuclear war
several times and the crisis that led to
that especially Kashmir remain both
India and Pakistan have refused to sign
the nonproliferation treaty along with
Israel and both of them have received us
support for development of their nuclear
weapons programs actually until today in
the case of India which is now a
usli war threats in the Middle East
which could become reality very soon
once again escalate the
dangers well fortunately there's a way
out of this simple way there's a way to
mitigate maybe end whatever threat Iran
is alleged to pose very simple uh move
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East the
opportuni is coming again this December
there's an international conference
scheduled uh to deal with this proposal
it has overwhelming international
support including inally majority of the
population in Israel that's fortunately
unfortunately it's blocked by the United
States and Israel a couple of days ago
Israel announced that it's not going to
participate and it won't consider the
matter until there's a general Regional
peace Obama takes the same stand he o
insists that any agreement must exclude
Israel and even must exclude calls for
other nations meaning the US to provide
information about Israeli nuclear
activities uh the United States and
Israel can uh delay Regional peace
indefinitely they've been doing that for
35 years on Israel Palestine virtual
International isolations along important
story that I don't have time to go into
here so therefore there's no hope for an
easy way to end what the West regards as
the most severe current crisis in no way
unless there's large scale public
pressure but there can't be large-scale
public pressure unless people at least
know about it and the media have done a
stellar job in averting that danger
nothing reported about the conference or
about any of the background and no
discussion apart from specialist Arms
Control journals where you can read
about it so that blocks the uh easy way
to end the worst existing crisis uh
unless people somehow find a way to
break through this well turning to the
election there's unanimity in ignoring
all of this not a word the only issue
discussed is uh
should uh the United States agree with
Israel's position Israel's position is
that the US should establish a red line
the red line should be uh Iranian
capability to produce nuclear weapons
the capability that vast number of
countries have so if they reach
capability we should bomb them that's
Israel's position it's also the position
of the US Senate a couple of days ago
the Senate declared uh 90
to1 the one exception was R Ron Paul uh
90 to1 that the United States must
accept Israel's position establish a red
line at capability contrary to the White
House well that's the most important
international issues they're also quite
crucial domestic issues uh the most
serious is that there are roughly 23
million people unemployed or
underemployed or just given up that's a
real catastrophe for the people
themselves you know their lives are
destroyed families are destroyed and uh
for the economy huge resources not being
used that does enter the elections the
Republicans have an answer to this and
we should enrich the rich uh you don't
use the word Rich anymore there's a
euphemism they're called the job
creators they don't create any jobs but
that's the way you refer to the Bridge
uh sometimes they're called the makers
not the takers so who who are the takers
well that's easy the big banks for
example are enormous takers they get $30
billion a year from just the government
insurance policy alone too big to fail
policy some estimated at about $60
billion uh the super rich are incredible
takers so you take a look just at tax
breaks tax breaks amount to more than 7%
of GDP gross domestic product that's two
fifths as large as the entire federal
government the tech breaks are
overwhelmingly regressive favoring the
rich and how do they achieve that nice
outcome by lobbying heavily and
systematically and systematically
contributing to political campaigns I'm
quoting that radical rag Foreign Affairs
uh there are many other regressive
devices patent laws designed to
radically increase the price of drugs
and others uh research and development
procurement all techniques for enriching
uh the private sector uh particularly
significant since the 1970s big change
in the way the economy works then
particularly since significant since
then are financial institutions uh there
is a role for banks in a State
capitalist economy uh so for example
what a bank is supposed to do is take
your deposit and uh decide to lend it to
somebody who who wants to do something
with it like you know uh buy a car send
the kids to college start a business buy
a house whatever it might be that's the
function of Banks and it was pretty well
filled that during the Great growth
period what sometimes called the Golden
Age the 50s and the 60s enormous growth
period pretty egalitarian that's pretty
much what banks were doing uh that at
that time the New Deal legislation still
prevailed including fair amount of
Regulation so there were no financial
crisis uh since the 1970s that's all
changed there's been a huge explosion of
financial institutions mostly dedicated
to financial
manipulations take a look at the
business pages of the New York Times
today there's a big debate about whether
there should be some regulation on super
fast automated trading you know where
you can cut the a trade by you know a
microsc or something and maybe beat
somebody else out which is causing all
kind of problems and Europe and
Australia and Canada are trying to clamp
down on it the United States is hanging
back but there's plenty of this uh by
2007 financial institutions had
literally reached 40% of corporate
profits well what's the impact of this
on the economy actually before the
recent crash there was very little study
of it the reason is there there's a kind
of a religious Doctrine the doctrine is
markets know best so it had to be
beneficial so if you're a well-trained
economist you just don't look at it uh
after the crash there was a kind of a
change of mood somewhat so prominent
International economists wrote them
quoting that an emerging consensus is
developing among economists on the need
for macr Prudential uh supervision of
financial markets there's growing
recognition that our financial system is
running a doomsday cycle whenever it
fails we rely on LAX money and fiscal
policies to bail it out now this
response teaches the financial sector a
lesson take large gambles to get paid
handsomely and don't worry about the
costs they'll be paid by the taxpayers
through bailouts and lost jobs and the
financial system is just is thus
resurrected to gamble again and to fail
again so I'm quoting Barry ien green and
Simon Johnson economists among you will
know that they're among the most
respected financial and international
economists the system is a doom Loop in
the words of the official of the bank of
England who's responsible for financial
stability uh after the crisis a number
of very prominent economists did start
to write about it there's a issue of the
Journal of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences that had articles by
Benjamin fredman at Harvard Robert solo
at MIT Noel Lau they both pointed out
that there hadn't been much in the way
of study of the impact of financial
institutions didn't say why but the
reason is the religion uh and they said
when you look at they started said if
you look at it carefully it looks like
they are imposing significant costs on
the economy uh the most respected
Financial commentator in the
English-speaking world the Martin wolf
of the financial times he went well
beyond that uh he said uh the outof
control financial sector is eating out
the modern market economy from inside
just as the larvae of the spider wasp
eats out the host in which it's been
laid Banks as presently constituted and
managed cannot be trusted to perform any
publicly in important function today's
Banks represent the Incarnation of
profit SE seeking Behavior taken to its
logical limits in which the only
question asked by the senior staff is
what can they get away with that's not a
spokesperson for the Occupy Movement
it's the most respected Financial
correspondent in the English-speaking
World quite conservative Martin wolf
actually there's a study by two leading
economists one of Nobel laurat Paul RoR
and George akerlof who found that the
most lucrative strategy for executives
at Big Banks would be to loot them to
pay themselves vast rewards knowing full
well that the government meaning the
taxpayer will move move in and save him
from
bankruptcy that was 20 years ago it's a
lot worse
today there are some limited steps to
try to deal with this but they're being
beaten back by armies of lobbyists well
that's the
takers uh what about the makers working
people they're under constant attack the
fiscal policies and trade policies are
designed to undermine manufacturing to
set workers in competition with each
other around the world with the poorest
to drive down wages meanwhile protect
professionals they are given all kinds
of protections they're not supposed to
compete uh unions are under terrific
attack that's been going on since the
1940s but in the last generation it's
been very harsh uh employers have been
basically told that they can violate the
laws at will and of course they're
following it
Clinton that was Reagan Clinton which
led to about a tripling of firing of
organizers IL legally Clinton added his
own method it was called NAFTA uh NAFTA
gave opportunities for employers to uh
threaten to move plants to Mexico in
order to break strikes that's illegal of
course but when you have a criminal
State it's fine to act illegally that
under a NAFTA study uh that led to a
very sharp increase in Breaking strikes
illegally by now they practically don't
exist private sector uh unionization is
down to about 7% public workers
have so far defended themselves but they
are under terrific attack no time to go
into it but I should mention that Obama
takes part in it uh all of this is has
been accelerated under uh
strong right-wing backlash that took
place backlash against the 60s that took
place from the early 70s major change in
the nature of the economy towards
financialization leading to what I
described and offshoring uh that led
very quickly to concentration of wealth
concentration of wealth leads to
concentration of political power almost
reflexively that leads to legislation uh
to enhance
the process the Vicious Cycle uh fiscal
policy
deregulation rules of corporate
governance quite a lot so the Vicious
Cycle goes on and it leads to what in
the Occupy slogan which is now become
prevalent of the 1% 99% distinction
actually 1% is wrong it's more like
.1% versus the rest if you actually look
at income distribution
s highly concentrated in a fraction of
1% CEOs hedge fund managers and so on uh
for the majority it's stagnation and
decline meanwhile costs of Elections
have
skyrocketed Supreme Court just has given
its help a couple of times uh there are
studies of what of the outcome by very
good political scientists the most
recent one good book by Martin gillens
uh concludes that 70% of the public are
powerless to shape government policy his
phrase meanwhile the rich get what they
want and the mechanisms are by no means
obscure this has changed the political
parties the
Republicans some time ago abandoned any
pretense of being a normal parliamentary
party uh they are just dedicated lock
step uh with a kind of catechism that
everyone has to repeat
towards service to the super rich and
the corporate sector uh you can't get
votes that way so they've been compelled
to mobilize sectors of the population
that have always been there and are
substantial but we're never politically
mobilized before the United States as
you know is a
unusually uh religious fundamentalist
religious country off the international
Spectrum I mean almost half the
population thinks the world was created
a couple of thousand years ago with all
the fossils and everything else uh about
a third of the population believes that
every word of the Bible is literally
true uh 2third expect the second coming
half of them in their lifetime and on
and on I don't think there's anything
like this close to it anywhere in the
world now it goes far back actually goes
to the colonists but uh it's always been
there it's never really been mobilized
as a political force now it is and for
good reasons you got to get voters
somehow uh there's also a nativist
tradition uh people are afraid that you
know they're coming after us uh and it's
amazing to watch so Rand Paul who's the
young libertarian hero in the Senate
right now he's organizing a campaign to
try to get people to uh block the Small
Arms Treaty at the United Nations it's a
important treaty small arms are
massacring people all over the world and
almost 80% come from the United States
but here's a rationale it says the arms
control treaty is a plot by the United
Nations and the Socialists radical Obama
and Clinton to try to take away our arms
so that when the UN comes to attack us
we won't be able to defend
ourselves you can't find this anywhere
in the world you know nothing remotely
like it but these sectors are there
they've been around it's old traditions
they're now being mobilized because
there's no other way to get votes and
that's why you get what you've just seen
in the Republican primaries I mean they
lunacy you know people in the rest of
the world are looking at this and can't
believe what's happening in the country
well what's happening is quite
understandable when one of the two
political parties abandons any pretense
of being a parliamentary party just
serves the super rich you know lockstep
uniformity there's no other way for them
to survive they've got to mobilize these
sectors to get votes that's what's
happening it's commonly said that
moderate Republicans have disappeared
which is not quite true they are now
cous Democrat and the Democratic party
is veered to the right as well seeking
the same corporate dollars not quite as
fast well there's a recent study by the
economic policy Institute that's the
major source of regular reliable
information on and Analysis of the
economy the recent study is called
failure by design it reviews the data
it's simple it's worth reading it's very
simple presentation of a lot of data uh
it reviews the data on the impact of the
uh called the neoliberal policies of the
past generation which includes a
astonishing concentration of wealth
while waging and incomes have stagnated
or declined the working hours have
increased far beyond Europe uh the weak
benefit system has eroded this
incidentally in the richest and most
powerful country in history with
extraordinary advantages the authors of
the study point out that the failure
they refer to is class-based so the
designers they've achieved spectacular
success and they also stress that it is
designed that is there have been
alternative policies they were always
possible they still are but it will take
the kind of activism that brought about
the New
Deal Progressive step in the 60s back to
much earlier days in order to do
something about this I mean progress
doesn't come as a gift from
above the post Golden Age economy the
one reviewed by this pamphlet it's
actually enacting a nightmare that was
envisaged by the classical economists
Adam Smith and David
Ricardo uh both of them recognized
they're talking about England of course
they recognized that if British
merchants and manufacturers invested
abroad and relied on Imports they would
profit but England would suffer both of
them hoped that these consequences would
be averted by what's called in the
literature home bias that is a
preference to do business in the home
country and see the Home Country grow in
develop therefore as if by an invisible
hand England would be saved from the
ravages of global markets actually
that's the one occurrence of the famous
phrase invisible hand in uh Smith's
classic Wealth of Nations and it's
pretty hard to miss it's the only
occurrence and it's basically in an
argument against neoliberal
globalization uh David Ricardo the
successor hoped that thanks to home bias
I'm quoting him now most men of property
uh would be satisfied with the low rate
of profits in their own country rather
than seek a more advantageous employment
for their wealth in foreign Nations uh
feelings that I would uh that I would be
sorry to see weakened same point
essentially actually that one was
brought to light I didn't know it before
in an important book on globalization
that was produced here by the uh uh
political economy Research
Institute uh in the uh past 30 years
Adam Smith's masters of mankind have
abandoned sentimental concerns for the
welfare of their own Society
concentrating instead on short-term gain
huge bonuses the be damned as long as
the powerful Nani State remains intact
to serve their interests uh the
developing picture is very aptly
described in a brochure for investors
that was produced by City Group it's a
huge Investment Bank and so on that's
once again feeding at the public trough
it's been doing that regularly for 30
years in a cycle of risky loans huge
profits crash bail out by the public the
banks
analysts this is a brochure for
investors they describe a world that's
dividing into two blocks one of which
they call the
plutonomy then there's the rest the vast
majority now they're sometimes called
the global precariat those who are
living a precarious
existence whether or not they are lucky
enough to uh get employment in the
United States they are subject to
Growing worker
insecurity that if you didn't know is
the basis for a healthy economy uh
Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan
explained that to to Congress uh while
he was loading his performance in
economic
management actually that's the real
shift in global society and not to China
and India but to the global plutonomy
and the City Group analysts understand
it they invi advise investors to focus
on the very rich where the action is
they have something called a plutonomy
stock basket which is Investments on
things that the rich want and they point
out that it's far outperformed the world
index of developed markets since 1985
that's when the Reagan Thatcher economic
programs of enriching the very rich and
punishing the rest were taking off and
by shredding the remnants of political
democracy the Masters also lay the basis
for carrying the lethal process forward
and will continue to do so as long as
their victims are willing to suffer in
silence which is always a choice and
never a
necessity
