professor nam chomsky thank you so much
for joining us today how are you
i'll
have to ask you to talk
slowly and clearly because i'm
not hearing very well
i will talk very slowly and clearly
i would like to start with the situation
in ukraine
the war in ukraine has been going now
for 111 days
and russia is focusing mainly on the
eastern
regions
western countries led by the united
states are supporting ukraine
financially and military with modern
missile launchers helicopters armored
personal carriers
anti-aircraft missiles even germany
decided in april to break with its
policy of only sending defensive weapons
and is now supplying ukraine with
offensive weapons
how do you assess the policy of the u.s
and its allies so far
there's a very simple
fact that
we have to keep in mind
a war
ends in
one or two ways
either
one side or the other capitulates
or else there's some kind of
diplomatic settlement
that's a truism
can't debate it
what's a diplomatic settlement
a diplomatic settlement is something
that
each side
tolerates
even if they don't like it
that's the nature of a diplomatic
settlement
now let's look at policy
u.s policy which
guides nato
is to refuse a diplomatic settlement
therefore that's very explicit
it was recently
reinforced at the
ramstein air base
in germany
where
the united states called together the
nato powers and others called the
contact group
and basically
laid down the directive
the war must continue
until russia is severely harmed
in fact harmed so severely
that it will not be able to undertake
any such aggression again
now you think about that for 30 seconds
it means
russia must be harmed more than germany
was
at the versailles treaty because that
obviously wasn't enough to stop germany
from returning to aggression
so that means russia has to
basically be
can't even describe it maybe something
like the morgenthal plan
which was not accepted but it was an
effort to
turn germany into an agricultural
society
well that so much is logic
let's turn to fact
fact is russia is never going to accept
this
never if that's the position that nato
is taking
then russia will
certainly use the
weapons that we all know it has
to
devastate ukraine
and uh set the stage for a
possible nuclear war which may wipe out
everything
that's official policy
official u.s policy
well there is an alternative
try to seek
a diplomatic settlement
now before the invasion
that was quite possible
but
as the u.s
publicly stated
state department stated
we will not take into consideration
any russian security concerns
no concerns about joining nato in
particular
in fact u.s policy was to move towards
what was called an enhanced program
for
uh
laying the stage for ukrainian
integration into nato
every
high u.s official who knows anything
about russia
for the last 30
years long before putin
has made it very clear to the to
washington
that
ukraine joining nato is a
red line that
no russian leader will ever accept
yeltsin gorbachev
putin anyone
well george bush ii the first george
bush lived up to that
the second george bush dropped it
he invited
ukraine into nato
that was vetoed at the time by
friends in germany sensibly
but u.s power was so overwhelming that
it stayed on the agenda
and now it's moving forward
well that means no diplomacy
that
alternative is
what i just said
russia will
if the need comes to that for them may
not
they will use the weapons that of course
they have we all know that
to devastate ukraine
set the stage for international war
uh that's
basically the situation
as it now stands
so just talking about sending weapons is
okay ukraine needs weapons to defend
itself but it's missing the major point
can we prevent
total devastation
and there's only one way to do that
that's by pursuing diplomatic options
they have narrowed now
they were broader before the invasion
now of course they've narrowed
but still
there's some openings
the war has also driven up military
spending in western countries and
increased calls for other countries such
as sweden finland etc to join nato
germany is now investing 100 billion
euros in its own military including
buying american f-35 stealth fighter
jets that can also carry nuclear bombs
capable of attacking russia
can you tell us about the impact that
military spending at home and abroad has
and will nato expansion
serve to protect the west
well there's an
interesting
situation developing in the western
european countries
sweden finland germany others
on the one hand
they are gloating
over the fact
that the russian military who was
demonstrated to be a white paper tiger
couldn't even conquer
cities
a couple of kilometers from the border
defended by a mostly citizen's army
so all the talk about
russian military power was exposed as
empty and the role clothing about this
how wonderful it is that's one idea
the second idea
is that we have to be so terrified
of the paper tiger
that we have to vastly increase military
spending uh germany alone
will
by under current projections
that germany alone will probably spend
as much as russia does on military
spending and it's a far more advanced
society of course that's germany alone
not the rest of nato not of course the
united states which overwhelms everyone
by a huge margin in military power so
these two ideas
one the russian military is totally
incompetent
can't conquer cities a couple miles on
the border
two we have to be terrified
of this
paper tiger and rearm to the teeth
well actually george orwell had a name
for that
he called it double think
the capacity to have
two contradictory ideas in mind and to
believe them both
he thought
that was a property of
ultra
totalitarian societies 1984
obviously was wrong
seems to be
perfectly possible in free democratic
societies
if you can think of any other
explanation for that
i'd like to hear it
there is no conceivable possibility
that russia will
attack anyone they can barely handle
this they had to back off
without nato involvement but uh
we can ask ourselves why
why do i believe this will in sweden
it's perfectly obvious
sweden has a
very substantial military industry
uh
saab industries is a major producer
they'd love to have a bigger market
furthermore for both sweden and finland
uh further militarization
and
deeper integration into nato maybe
sweden and finland were already
integrated into the nato command joint
exercises and so on but if they move
towards
joining nato totally
that means accepting us domination
that's what nato is
then that helps move them farther to the
right
to dismantle
what's left of social democracy
and of course
powerful
business forces right-wing forces in
both countries are delighted with this
i should say the united states is ultra
delighted
that putin apart from the
criminal aggression
also acted very seriously
what he did
was drive europe
into washington's pocket
the greatest gift he could give to the
united states
uh all through the cold war
there have been basically two options
for nato
one was
what's called the atlanticist option
uh joined nato
to become subservient to the united
states kind of a vessel community
second option was to become for europe
to become
an independent force sometimes called a
third force
in international affairs
that's the goal
the valley bronze hospital
common european home
actually george bush the first
proposed a partnership for peace which
was
not very different from this
clinton
dismantled it when he
violated bush's promise not to
expand nato to the east
and then the second bush
violated it radically when he invited
ukraine into nato
but these options were still available
before the invasion
tomorrow macron had made some
tentative gestures towards
accommodation
putin in his
stupidity
totally rejected them
and instead drove europe into the hands
of nato
from the russian point of view
utter imbecility apart from the
criminality of the criminality of the
invasion but the united states is
alterly delighted
if you go to the offices of
lockheed martin they're
euphoric you know finally they've been
trying for years
to get europe to
raise its military spending
they wouldn't do it
the fossil they've also been trying to
get
germany to end nordstrom
but it didn't get anywhere
now russia has handed it to the united
states on a silver platter
i mean from
russia's point of view
apart from the criminality of the
aggression it's completely stupid
but that's the way
small groups of autocrats behave
russia is now apparently run by a
little clique of uh
tough guys
uh in putin's closed circle
they're interested in themselves
it's a kleptocracy they're rubbing the
country blind
that's all they're thinking about
and they couldn't think through
the fact that they are
handing the united states a major
gift the united states is euphoric
fossil fuel companies are delighted
they can now
increase
fossil fuel production
wrecking the environment
destroying the prospects for human life
and they're even praised for it
what could be better
so
putin just
it's almost unbelievable the stupidity
understanding the situation in a
historical context like you are
attempting to do
or even talking about the dangers of
nuclear war
is quickly dismissed as what about ism
or peddling putin talking points or
justifying the russian war this has been
happening on the mainstream media as
well as social media
it seems that the only answer we can
give at the moment is to escalate it how
can we overcome this discourse
of
trying to justify the russian invasion
when for example you are trying to and
many others are trying to simply provide
context and the role that the west has
played
well one of the
very striking features of
the modern age
is the serious decline
in simply rational discourse
the kind of commentary that you hear
across the board
is just unbelievable
so
one of the leading
figures in apart from the official u.s
policy
you find people like richard hawes form
a
major figure in foreign policy
uh the uh
council of foreign relations and so on
making speeches in which he says we have
to ensure that ukraine wins the war
you hear the same from
people in germany what does that mean
how does ukraine defeat russia
you can pour all the arms you want into
ukraine it's not going to defeat russia
everybody with a brain knows that
well let me just say that
i mentioned
council on foreign relations leading
figures
talking total nonsense
same in germany what you hear on social
media that you're referring to
is another form of total nonsense
there is no way to justify the invasion
none
you can say correctly
that there was provocation
yes
kind of provocation that i mentioned
when the u.s says it's not going to
consider
russian security concerns
when it's been
moving to integrate ukraine
into the nato military command
against the advice of just about every
high u.s official who knows anything
about this including the current and
past cia directors
that's all provocation but provocation
does not yield justification
there is nothing that can justify
criminal aggression kind of crime that
ranks with
the u.s invasion of iraq
the
hitler-stalin invasion of poland
these are
what the nuremburg tribunal called the
supreme international crime
differing from other war crimes in that
it
includes the totality of evil that
follows
that's the russian invasion
no
justification plenty of provocation no
justification
now again it takes
a few minutes thought to understand this
but a few minutes thought is apparently
beyond the capacity
of much of the social media
just as it is beyond the capacity of
uh leading figures in
germany the united states and others who
are talking perfect nonsense
when you ask
how do you proceed
to get
ukraine to defeat russia
short of ukraine being totally
devastated
perfectly obvious
but apparently beyond the capacity of
thought i should mention maybe something
else
i'm sure you're familiar with the
famous doomsday clock of the
bulletin of atomic scientists now said a
100 seconds to midnight
they give three reasons
one is the growing threat of nuclear war
two is
failure to deal with
the crisis of climate destruction
both made worse
by the russian invasion
and the third is
the collapse of an arena of rational
discourse
that was
before the invasion
now it's worse
i want to shift gears now and focus on
israel palestine
shireen abu ah an american palestinian
journalist was allegedly killed by an
israeli sniper
the palestinian authority investigation
concluded that
was hit by a bullet fired by israeli
soldiers
and the israeli forces are still
conducting an investigation
the palestinian authority has ruled out
a joint investigation
although the u.s and the eu have
condemned the attacks
and called for an independent
investigation
no actions such as sanctions have been
taken
can you talk about the significance of
this case
it's very significant
what is most important
most striking
is the behavior of the israeli army
at the funeral
i mean bad enough that they assassinated
a journalist but take a look i'm sure
you've seen the videos of the funeral
where the idf attacked the funeral
even attacked the pole bearers made them
drop the coffin what was striking about
that is how brazen it was
they simply don't care
they're
one of the leading israeli journalists
guidon levy covers the west bank
simply described it frankly he said
idf stormtroopers his word
just attacked the funeral because they
don't care
they are confident of u.s support
and therefore they'll do anything
doesn't matter anymore they're not
trying to pretend
now there are other cases like
the supreme court
just ordering
a thousand
palestinian
villagers to leave their homes because
the united israel wants to take them
over for settlers
i mean they that supreme court judgment
was given at midnight
in the hope that people wouldn't notice
it too much but that's as bad as
attacking the funeral
and they're doing it brazenly
it's much more than this
uh long ago
israel
annexed the syrian golan heights and
what's called jerusalem actually an area
about five times
the size of jerusalem including
many arab villages israel enacts them
in
explicit violation
of security council orders ordering them
not to do it
they didn't care they did it they
assumed the united states would support
it
which it did
and under trump the united states has
formalized its support that has now said
yes you can annex any territory you want
in violation of the security council
orders well
in those circumstances
apparently israel feels they're going to
do just about anything
you read this morning's newspaper this
morning
they pretty much conceded that they just
poisoned two iranian nuclear scientists
what happens when somebody else does
that
well when israel does it it's applauded
in the united states why shouldn't they
assassinate people they don't like
okay as long as the united states
continues to back this
and europe
sits by quietly and says uh
we don't care
uh israel will simply become more and
more brazen and then comes another issue
you'll notice that in the
uh shirin
above that case
the u.s media
really for the first time
gave extensive exposes of the crime
cnn washington post new york times
that's a change
israel's actions are becoming
so blatantly
intolerable
that even the mainstream media in the
united states are beginning to complain
about them
and in fact if you look at polls
israel's losing its support
if you go back
10 or 20 years
israel was the darling of the liberal
community
not anymore
the liberal opinion is
more supportive of palestinian rights
support for israel in the united states
has shifted to the far right
it's not in the democratic party it's in
the right wing of the republican party
evangelical christians
based on their
theology of
second coming
uh
uh ultra nationalists and
military and security forces that's the
base of israeli support
that could lead to a change in u.s
policy
that's
the most likely
salvation of anything for the
palestinians
the rest of the world
given up you know
uh this morning
you may have noticed that uh
the leading
uh israeli
writer of olivet yoshua died in a lot of
obituary swarm
including his final statements about
how he had given up on
an effort for a diplomatic settlement
it's important that he said that a
couple years ago
but it's a sign of the
shift in israel among
more or less liberal opinion which is
now shrinking it's becoming a very
reactionary state
today again
another poll in
israel and it's reported
a majority of israelis don't want to
have any palestinian participate in any
government
country is becoming more racist more
reactionary
it's established close relations with
hungary
the
outlier in the european union
a liberal democracy they
have shared racist
anti-muslim
doctrines they both feel aggrieved
because they're not
treated
in a friendly fashion by europe and they
both think they have every right to do
what they want
so they're establishing a closer
relation
that's part of the world system that's
developing
incidentally just to add to that
i'm sure you followed the
meeting in
uh hungary a couple of weeks ago of the
reactionary neo-fascist elements in
europe
the leading participant in that
was the american
conservative political action committee
that's the core of the republican party
president trump former president trump
gave a
glowing speech
uh
expressing his great admiration for
hungary's destruction of democracy and
uh
racist uh
christian nationalism the
uh
tucker carlson who's the leading
television personality in the united
states simply worships hungary he gave a
speech done a major documentary on how
wonderful hungary is
notice this is the united states it's
not it's not an andorra it's the most
powerful country in human history and
these are the groups that are going to
take congress in november they already
have the supreme court
they're gearing up to
block
democratic procedures so that they can
pick up the presidency in 2024
that means something for the world
for everyone in the world a lot
it means we're on a course to disaster
in germany it's a very difficult
environment
to talk about israel in palestine to use
terms like apatite
because
always the history of germany is invoked
into this discussion
drowning out any
debate discussion
discourse on this issue
for us for example in our organization
we have been accused for anti-semitism
for just reporting on israeli apathy
whether amnesty international is
reporting it or human rights watch
[Music]
how do you overcome this given
the difficulty and past of germany
well germany is a special case
because of its
utterly hideous record
so yes
i can understand whether it be special
sensitivity about this in germany
nevertheless
we should be
honest about it
for
50 years
israel's
has been
explicitly
trying to use
the holocaust
as a propaganda weapon
to justify crushing the palestinians
occupying palestinian territory
illegally
practically destroying gaza
almost unlivable now
a million children can't even get
potable water
constant atrocities in the west bank
you read journalists like kiron levy
amirahas others daily reports
they think they can get away with this
as long as they can wave the holocaust
in front of people's eyes
i should say this is explicit
so if you go back to
1973
uh abba eben
leading israeli statesman highly
respected wrote a very interesting
article
in
the more liberal jewish journal in the
united states congress weekly
in this article he said
the duty of american jews is to show
that any criticism
of
what he called zionism meaning his
policies of his government
any criticism is either anti-semitism
if it comes from non-jews
or neurotic self-hatred if it comes from
jews
you actually mentioned two people
i was proud to be one of them the other
was i f stone
committed zionist
critical of israel
therefore a neurotic self-hating jew
okay that makes a hundred percent nobody
can criticize israel it's explicit
perfectly explicit
it's interesting if you
take a look at the
famous uh definition of anti-semitism by
uhura
it's it's used all the time
according to that of evan is a leading
anti-semite
because one of their criteria for
anti-semitism
is the claim that all jews have to be
associated with israel
so alba heaven is one of the leading
anti-semites in the world this israeli
supreme court
is totally anti-semitic
they've stated that
israel is the sovereign state of the
jewish people
like it's my sovereign state living in
the united states not the sovereign
state of its population
a perfect example of anti-semitism by
the
standard definition
well again i can
understand hesitancy in germany to
talk too much about that but they
shouldn't fall for it
and everywhere else it should be
ridiculed
i want to examine some socioeconomic
issues inflation is running high in
western nations
the u.s experienced the highest rate in
40 years at 8.6 in may
whereas germany experienced
7.9 percent what in your assessment is
it is driving this is it the war in
ukraine western sanctions workers wages
or the fossil fuel cartels grief or
profitability
some even claim social spending during
covet call is now causing inflation
what can be done to protect the public
and how do you assess inflation
well first of all the
high inflation was
prior to the ukraine invasion
that
exacerbated it but
not by very much you look at the figures
it was almost as high before
there's a lot of debate among the
economists so what's what's causing it
but the
basic
consensus i think is that
the main factor that's causing it is
supply chain disruptions
the globalization
the neoliberal globalization project
followed business principles
that means
try to be as efficient as possible
don't waste anything
well that's a
a program for disaster it means if
anything goes wrong everything collapses
we're seeing that dramatically in the
united states
with the health system not so much in
germany the united states has a
scandalous health system to run on
business principles
no excess capacity
no excess beds because that's
not efficient
so what happens when covet comes
no beds in the hospitals
no resource for testing
in you work by business principles
you can be efficient as long as nothing
goes wrong
okay as soon as it does
disaster
uh you have
container ships and they piled up in the
los angeles harbor and can't unload no
well all of this is combining with the
fact that during the
pandemic the worst of the pandemic
people were cutting down
on spending
on uh now there's
a lot tremendous amount of demand
supplies aren't coming in
yes you get inflation
there's another factor
uh
monopolization
that was the result of the neoliberal
programs and the
uh
and their
or or the you know the german
equivalence of that and so on austerity
the
these have all led to
sharply reduced regulation
and increased
concentration of economic power on
almost every domain
agriculture manufacturing energy
sharp
move towards monopolization
well monopolization means you have the
capacity to raise prices
and they're doing it
there's tremendous corporate profits
in the last couple of years
a large part of it is just they're free
to raise prices as much as they want
that's a major factor in inflation
uh
energy
uh
the agriculture just about every area
well all of these things combine
you have
serious economic problems
we
received some questions from the public
one of the questions that we we asked
the public to send on some questions and
one question is here from facebook
it says last year professor chomsky you
said in an interview
and i'm paraphrasing here
that unvaccinated people should not be
forced but should isolate themselves
voluntarily and cold food is their
problem
are you still of that opinion given that
the vaccine has been shown to be only
for self-protection
and not for the protection of others
particularly when it comes to the omri
con variant
unvaccinated people
are free to do whatever they want
except harm others
nobody has the right
to
walk around with an assault rifle and
shoot randomly that's not freedom
similarly if some business
say a restaurant decides they want
custom customers to be masked
they have a right to do that
they have a right to protect themselves
against people who want to feel free to
harm them
so therefore
people who don't want to be vaccinated
or
perfectly free to do whatever they want
except to violate
restrictions
which where people try to defend
themselves
like the workers in a restaurant have a
right to defend themselves against
people who want to come in and infect
them
it's as simple as that
i don't see it's true that it aroused a
huge fewer
more sign of the irrationality
in fact the whole
anti-vaccine
hysteria that's developed mainly in the
united states but also in germany and
elsewhere is another sign of the
growing
radical irrationality
there's simply
virtually no doubt that
the vaccines are very effective in fact
it's a triumph of contemporary science
and
the stories about the harm that they do
to you
is unbelievable
nonsense
you know they're put
they're implanting a chip into you
that's going to allow bill gates to
control you
there's one thing after another
it's uh
i mean of course there's an element of
uncertainty that's life
there's an element of uncertainty about
anything
but the evidence is simply overwhelming
about their
positive effect
every
every national academy in the world
every academy of science without any
exception
every
medical journal in the world without any
exception
i think all just take this for granted
but there's a big popular movement
saying we don't believe anything
actually that has
part of its roots in the
neoliberal assault against the
population
which has that's 40 years
of a major attack on the general
population
and it's lit
just to give you some figures
in the united states there was a study
by the
highly respectable rand corporation
quasi governmental
uh
investigation
corporation
they studied the
transfer of wealth
from the lower 90 percent of the
population
working class middle class
transfer of wealth to them from them
to the top 1
during the neoliberal years
their estimate is about 50 trillion
dollars
that's pretty effective
highway robbery and it's had an effect
all over the united states all over
europe the same things of not to that
extent but similar
things have been happening it's led to
anger
resentment
distrust of authority
distrust of government undermining of
democracy
the
anti-vaccine
hysteria is one
lethal aspect of that
i'm not sure if you've heard about this
because as i have read that you don't uh
look at hollywood a lot but this is
another question that i would like to
ask you from the public there was a big
trial
um on this hollywood actor johnny depp
and his ex-wife amber heard the trial
was followed by millions and even
billions of people worldwide
almost all major media outlets gave
razor-sharp coverage of the trial
by contrast however the press freedom
trial of the century the case of julian
assange who may be extradited to the u.s
soon has not received even a fraction of
this coverage can you explain
why people are so disinterested in the
case assange
and why the media ignores it and gives
something like a hollywood scandal
much more coverage than a scandal
involving press freedom and democracy
well julian assange
committed a major crime
he acted as an honest journalist
can't have that
there are things that
systems of power
want to be concealed from the population
assange violated that
he
brought to the general population
information that they have every right
to have
and that power systems don't want them
to have
information about war crimes for example
well that's a crime you have to be
punished for that
so he's been
kept in
conditions of virtual torture
for six years now
first
isolated
in a apartment
ecuadorian embassy is
a small apartment i visited him there
he had fewer rights than a
prisoner on death row who can at least
walk outside and see the sun
not assange
then the british put him in a
high security prison
for the crime of not paying bail
okay
the u.n repertoire on torture simply
described this as torture
he's uh
personally
correctly destroyed
now he's facing
extradition to the united states where
could spend the rest of his life such as
it is in a
high security prison well that's
punishment for a major crime
you don't tell
citizens
things they ought to know
but the powerful don't want them to know
and the failure
of most journalists to defend him
is outrageous
they're the ones who should be right in
the front
defending him some are
very good ones
but
too many are not
it's a real scandal
also a scandal in australia
he's an australian citizen
australia should have been
pressing hard for him to be released to
australia at the very beginning of this
uh everyone in the world is afraid of
stepping on the toes of the united
states
might as well face it
the world is
you know
international relations specialists can
publish their essays but the fact is
that the world is run very much like the
mafia
if the godfather
lays down orders
you better follow them or you're in
trouble
we see this all over like take the
iran situation
the united states pulled out of the
joint agreement
the nuclear agreement in violation of
security council orders
it imposed very harsh sanctions to
punish iran for the fact that the united
states is violating the agreement
europe doesn't like it
your opposes the sanctions it's been
spoken out strongly against them but it
follows them
it adheres to them
because you don't anger the godfather
pretend whatever you like but that's the
way the world works
same on the cuba sanctions
60 years of torture of cuba
the whole world is against it you look
at the
u.n votes the 184 to 2 united states and
israel
but everyone adheres to it
same reason
you don't anger the godfather who has
plenty of weapons to punish you
more weapons thanks to putin's stupidity
it seems we got another question from
the public again about covid uh this
time someone's asking professor norm
chomsky
given all the costs
that the economy that the children that
the businesses
and everybody had to face
do you think that the covet measures
were to some degree
an overreaction by the government or did
you consider them to be adequate
the price on the economy
doesn't have to be much of a price on
the economy take new zealand
which imposed
maybe the harshest measures in the
western world
economy did fine in fact it improved
because the
pandemic receded it was controlled
people get back to normal life
my feeling is
the measures weren't strict enough
if they were done i mean
it's a
kind of a rule in the united states and
to some extent in europe that you have
to denounce china for everything
so one of the things we have to denounce
china for
is
that there
are a few thousand deaths
in the united states a million deaths
and china has a
five times the population
so per capita that deaths are
minuscule as compared with the united
states so we have to denounce china
for the policies it used
to save a couple of million people
well
that's
the way a deeply indoctrinated society
works but as far as the measures were
taken
some of them were probably mistaken
remember the situation
when the coven
epidemic came
nobody knew much about it
you had to take
experimental measures
to see what would work and some of the
experimental measures were wrong
naturally
but most of them were basically correct
and
probably should have done been done more
strenuously
my organization activism munich
was built
on the criticisms that you expressed in
manufacturing consent
we strive to develop a media outlet that
is independent non-profit grass roots it
does not take
money from advertisements corporations
or governments
how important is it for people to
support
independent and grassroots media
in this day and age
how important is it to
support
popular organizations
and
change government policy to
benefit them
rather than to benefit the super rich
that's the basic question
that's
not only important but
it's essential if we're going to survive
i mean just
remember what the
liberal policies of the past 40 years
have been
i gave
the rough estimate for the united states
stealing
50 trillion dollars from working people
and the middle class to enrich
the ultra rich and the corporate sector
well that goes on and of course much
else
like uh
climate denialism uh under the
impact of the
banks the fossil fuel fuel industries
so on they say let's make as much money
as we can and who cares what happens
well
that's a recipe for
total disaster
uh species annihilation
if all of that isn't changed then soon
there isn't going to be any anything
else to talk about
uh it'll be over
literally over that's if we don't
get nuclear war first
and it's very dangerous
not
i'm just repeating what the
day clock analysts repeated and every
sensible analyst knows
if you look at current policy
astonishing
so
it's easy to think take ukraine again
it's very easy to think of
scenarios
that could lead on to nuclear war
so so far
russia has not
attacked
supply lines
the supply lines that are bringing in
massive supplies to ukraine
actually western
analysts have wondered why they're not
doing it well sooner or later they might
do it
in that case
they run into a conflict with nato
at that point
your imagination can move very quickly
up the
escalation ladder
let's take another case
there's a tremendous
problem of
starvation all over the world
caused by the
closing off of the one of the major
sources of
grain fertilizer and so on the black sea
region
well there's a russian blockade
again there are two ways to deal with
that
one way is violence what comes naturally
to the united states and its allies
the other way is
negotiation diplomacy
well what do we see
a hundred percent
talked about escalating violence
so
the wall street journal major business
journal just had a major editorial
in which they said
the united states navy
should break the blockade
okay what happens when
the u.s navy starts confronting russian
ships
did the russians say oh that was
pleasant why don't you sink our fleet
not very likely
so you may not like it
but you have to recognize the real world
and the business community the wall
street journal apparently can't
fortunately the pentagon can so it
blocks these efforts
they're the peacekeeping force in the
united states at this point literally
uh
take another proposal is
sin
sophisticated advanced anti-ship weapons
to sink the russian fleet they already
managed to sink the
flagship so let's go on
again what happens
does russia react well if it does we're
finished you know
there's even
leading figures like hillary clinton for
example there are lots of people in
congress who say we should impose a
no-fly zone
that sounds nice
again depending on blocky
because the pentagon understands
what the heroic postures don't
understand
namely if you want to have a no-fly zone
you have to have control of the air
control of the air means you attack
attack and destroy
russian aircraft aircraft installations
which are inside russia
then what happens
well if you want to make fancy speeches
uh fine nothing will happen
if you think
about
the likely future
what will happen is we're finished
this is going on all over
it's beyond belief
professor nom chomsky intellectual
activist and author thank you so much
for your time today
thank you
i'm sorry for the hassle about skype
absolutely no problem it worked out well
and we are very thankful for your time
and thank you guys for tuning in today
don't forget to subscribe to our youtube
and rumble video channels and to donate
so we can continue to produce
independent and non-profit news and
analysis i'm your host amroza see you
guys next time
well first
they are getting julian
then they will get you
me everyone
this is
a clear struggle
for
freedom of the press
and for the right of citizens to know
that which governments are doing behind
their backs supposedly on their behalf
[Music]
the lying is at the heart of it so if
you go
and get people really inside the
national security state
and reveal the war crimes the lying the
 of the arms industry
that's like putting a dagger into a
place you're not allowed to go so i
think this case is absolutely
devastating horrifying and wide-reaching
implications for press freedom and
journalism
as a whole and unfortunately
people have already made up their mind
about julian assange they're not taking
a stand the way they should be it turned
out he was under surveillance it turned
out there were people eavesdropping on
everything he was doing it turned out
there were people even checking the uh
the nappies of his baby
to check who it was and all the rest of
it for goodness sake this is inhuman
treatment of somebody that tried to
bring some humanity to our planet he is
being punished as is julian assange and
edward snowden for releasing the truth
he's on death row he will be on death
row if he is extradited a felon
who confessed is one of the us's
principal witnesses in this protest case
not long ago he confessed that
everything he said was a fabrication
not a word about him if this man gets
extradited to the united states he will
be tortured until the day he dies
the cia was trying to murder julian
assange or to capture julian assange it
may now be julian and it may now be
glenn greenwald
but who will be next julian is a
publisher
julian is also a son
he's a friend
he's my fiance
and a father
julian needs his freedom
and our democracy
needs a free press yes it is about
julian assange but it is much more also
about all of you and your children and
your families and 20 years from now
will you still be able to know the truth
about what your government is doing or
when it has been become a crime to
inform you about what your government is
doing with your tax money to other
people that have not done anything wrong
in their
lives everyone i'm taylor hudak with
activism dna i'm in london outside the
old bailey courthouse
assange was rearrested under the new
superseding indictment
today is the first day of the appeal
hearing in the extradition proceedings
hi everyone i'm taylor hudak and i'm
outside london's belle marsh prison
we are all julian assange how would you
know about all the crimes committed in
our names if there were the billions of
leaks published by wikileaks if wars can
be started by lies
peace can be started by truth we're
gonna lock people away
um facing 200 years in prison for
exposing war crimes what kind of country
what kind of world are we going to live
in so we have to stand up and
collectively say no more if you're an
activist of any kind right left center
an animal rights activist an
environmental activist a socialist
activist any kind of an activist against
global institution
and you're not capable of setting aside
whatever emotional feelings you have for
julian assange
to defend basic press freedom
and stand opposed to the efforts of the
trump government and boris johnson's
tory government to criminalize the
activities of julian assange and
wikileaks and publishing information in
the public interest you are going to
create a world for yourself in which the
presidents you're now acquiescing to or
cheering
out of some misplaced hatred for julian
assange are going to be used against you
when you're in a dark room
one person switching on the light
we make everyone see
right don't look for the light somewhere
else go and switch it on yourself we
should all thank julian for his courage
and integrity in providing us with this
precious gift that great cost to himself
much to our shame but think about the
opportunities that you have right
because there are no heroes
nobody's going to save you right there
are only heroic actions
there are only heroic choices
there are only people who moment by
moment see bad things and recognize
maybe i can do something
maybe i can't fix everything
but maybe i can make progress maybe i
can make things better maybe i
am the one that i'm waiting for
and as soon as you start thinking like
that you'll realize that you are free
assange
rock and roll
