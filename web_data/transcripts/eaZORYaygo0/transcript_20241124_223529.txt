Adam Smith is very rarely read he's
worshiped but not read so for example
everyone's heard of the phrase invisible
hand but almost no one knows how he used
it the term invisible hand actually does
appear in his classic Wealth of Nations
once it appears in an argument against
what's now called
neoliberalism uh classical what's now
called neoclassical economics that we're
supposed to worship so we're supposed to
worship Adam Smith and neoclassical
economics and they radically differ on
the notion invisible hand Adam Smith was
concerned as David Ricardo later was uh
that if there was free movement of
capital and free import of
goods uh he was concerned about England
he said England will suffer because
British capitalists will invest abroad
uh and they'll import from abroad and
that'll harm the English economy Ricardo
had similar concerns and Adam Smith then
gave an argument was not a very good
argument but his argument was that uh
English investors will prefer to invest
in England because of what some called a
home bias they'll have a preference for
investing close by and therefore as if
by an invisible hand uh England will be
saved from the Menace of free Capital
movement and free Imports that's
invisible hand what what's that got to
do
with the KO Institute or or the modern
enthusiasm about free Capital flow and
um you know having us corporations
invest in China so they can send stuff
back here to sell cheap exploiting
Chinese workers that's not Adam Smith uh
and it goes right across the board I
mean everyone who went to college uh
learned the first paragraph of Wealth of
Nations in which he talks about how
wonderful ful division of labor is you
know allows for all kind of efficiency
and productivity and so on not very many
people got to page you know whatever it
is Page 400 uh in which he points out
that the vision of Labor is monstrous
because it turns people into creatures
as stupid and ignorant as a person can
possibly be uh person who just becomes a
machine and that's a a terrible attack
on fundamental human right rights and
therefore he says in any civilized
society the government is going to have
to intervene to prevent division of
labor how many people get that far you
know in fact Smith does give Arguments
for markets rather nuanced
arguments I just take what they call
trade you know the so-called
conservatives are very excited that
trade is increasing so for example NAFTA
is supposed to be a great Triumph of
conservatism at
uh it increased trade between Mexico and
the United States well it it it's true
that crossborder
interactions between Mexico and the
United States increased but would Adam
Smith or any classical liberal or
traditional conservative have called
that trade I mean suppose General Motors
assembles Parts in Indiana and sends
them to Illinois
for assembly and then to New York to
sell is that trade
well suppose it happens to cross the
Mexican border but it's still internal
to a huge command economy is that trade
well it turns out that if you look at
the rough figures which are all that we
have uh before and after uh the part of
crossb interactions between univer
Mexico and the US that was internal to a
corporation was about 50% and now it's
about
2/3 that's no more trade than if the
Kremlin uh produced things in Leningrad
and sent them to Ukraine for assembly
and to Poland to sell operations
internal Dem command
economies we have just simply you know
they just to even to talk about trade or
free trade or entrepreneurial values or
consumer choice or Democratic
functioning and so on is putting us in a
world of Illusion and fantasy that's why
these terms are all demeaned not just
conservative
