[Applause]
well the first question always is can
you hear
me can you hear me in the
back close as POS how's that can you
hear me in the
back
you're killing
[Applause]
me how's this any
different how's
that okay well I'll try to not eat it
you have okay people can't
see yeah you're they both on okay you're
good well it's uh it's a little hard
to talk at
a give a talk on a Howard's in Memorial
lecture at a occupy meeting there's
mixed feelings necessarily go along with
it closer closer first of all regret
that uh Howard's not here to take part
in and uh invigorate in his inimitable
way uh something that would have been
the dream of his life uh secondly uh
excitement that the dreams actually
being fulfilled it's it's a dream that
uh for which he gave he he laid a lot of
the groundwork as I said it would have
been
a fulfillment of a dream for him to have
uh been here uh with you and it is a a
very exciting
development okay well why don't you take
this how about
that well it is an extremely exciting
development in fact uh it's kind of
spectacular and uh
unprecedented there's never been
anything like it that I can think of if
the bonds and associations that are
being established in these uh remarkable
events can be
sustained uh through a long hard period
ahead because victories don't come
quickly it could turn out to be a a
really historic
uh very significant moment in American
history uh the fact that the
demonstrations are unpre the Occupy
Movement is unprecedented is quite
appropriate uh uh the it's an
unprecedented
era uh not just this moment but uh
actually since the 1970s in the 1970s
there was began a major turning point in
American history
uh since the uh
for centuries since the country began it
had been developing society and not in
very pretty ways that's another story
but uh it was a developing Society with
ups and downs but uh the general
progress towards wealth
industrialization development uh uh even
in dark and hope there was a lot of
pretty near constant uh expectation that
it's going to go on like this uh that
was true even in very dark times I'm
just old enough to remember the Great
Depression and uh after the first few
years by the mid-30s uh although the
situation was
objectively much harsher than it is
today nevertheless the spirit was quite
different there was a sense that we're
going to get out of it uh even among
unemployed people a lot of my relatives
that uh uh it'll get better there's this
there's a militant labor movement
organizing CIO organizing was going on
it was getting to the point of sitdown
strikes which really are very
frightening to the business world you
can see it in the business press at the
time because a sit down strike is just
a step before taking over the Factory
and running it yourself and uh something
which incidentally is very much on the
agenda today and we should keep it in
mind I'll come back to it uh also the
New Deal legislations were beginning to
come under popular pressure uh and there
just was a sense somehow we're going to
get out of it it's quite different now
and now there's a kind of pervasive
sense of hopelessness sometimes despair
I think it's quite new in American
history and it has an objective basis uh
in the 1930s uh unemployed working
people could anticipate realistically
that the jobs are going to come back uh
if you're a worker in manufacturing
today and the level of unemployment in
manufacturing is approximately like the
depression uh if current Tendencies
persist that's not those jobs aren't
going to come back uh there's uh the the
change took place in the'
70s uh a lot of reasons for it uh uh one
of the underlying reasons uh discussed
mainly by uh economic historian Robert
brener has done a lot of work on it is
that the falling rate of profit there
were other factors it led to major
changes in the economy uh a reversal of
the several hundred years of progress
towards industrialization and
development and turned to a process
process of de-industrialization and D
development of course manufacturing
production continued but
overseas uh very profitable but no good
for the workforce and uh uh along with
that came uh a a significant shift of
the economy from productive Enterprise
producing things can need or can use uh
to financial
manipulations uh Financial calization of
the economy really took off at that time
before the before the' 70s Banks were
Banks they did what banks are supposed
to do in a state capitalist economy take
unused funds like say your bank account
and transfer it to some potentially
useful purpose like um buying a home
sending a kid to college or whatever it
might be that changed radically in this
and in there were no financial crisis uh
it was a period of enormous growth the
highest growth in American history uh
maybe in economic history sustained
growth through the 50s and 60s and it
was a galarian so the lowest quintile
did about as well as the highest
quintile a lot of people moved
into reasonable Lifestyles what it's
called here middle class working class
it's called in other countries uh but
they uh it was real and uh the '
60s acceler tolerated it the activism in
the 60s after a pretty dismal decade uh
really civilized the country and lots of
ways that are uh permanent they're not
they're not changing they're staying on
uh' 70s came along sudden sharp change
de-industrialization offshoring of
production uh shifting to financial
institutions which grew
enormously uh also in uh should say that
in the 50s and the 60s there was also
the development of what several decades
later became the high-tech economy uh
computers internet it Revolution mostly
developed in the ' 50s and the 60s
substantially in the state sector took a
couple of decades before it took off but
it was developed there uh the 1970s the
developments that took place set off a a
kind of a vicious
cycle it led to uh concentration
concentration of wealth increasingly in
the hands of uh the financial sector
which uh doesn't benefit the economy
probably harms it and the society but it
did lead to tremendous concentration of
wealth substantially there a
concentration of wealth yields
concentration of political power which
in turn gives rise to legislation that
increases that accelerates the cycle of
fiscal policies tax changes uh rules of
corporate governance
deregulation uh essentially bipartisan
alongside of this came a began the very
sharp rise
in uh costs of Elections which
drives the political parties even deeper
than before into the pockets of the
corporate sector uh a couple years later
started a different process which has
been described particularly by Tom
Ferguson who's going to be here uh
Monday he probably will talk about it so
I won't much but uh U the U parties be
dissolved essentially it used to be that
if you wanted a if a person in
Congress hoped for a position
of say a committee chair or something
some position of responsibility you got
it mainly through seniority and Service
uh within a couple of years you started
having to put money into the party
coffers in order to get ahead that just
drove the whole system even deeper into
the pockets of the corporate sector
increasingly the financial sector a
tremendous concentration of wealth uh
mainly in literally the top onet of 1%
of the population potion meanwhile for
the general population it began and
opened a period of pretty much
stagnation or even decline for the
majority uh people got by but by uh
pretty artificial means of borrowings so
a lot of debt uh a longer working hours
but PR soon much higher than in other
industrial countries even past Japan
long past Europe uh can't hear me
there you go
sorry still how about
that so there was a period of stagnation
and decline for the majority that
continued alongside a very sharp
concentration of wealth uh the political
system began to dissolve there's always
been a gap between public policy and uh
uh the public will but it just grew kind
of
astronomically you can see it right now
in fact the the big
[Applause]
the can't hear me I don't know what to
do about it these things are in my
mouth and they don't taste it the uh
I'll just keep going you can make it
up it's on the live stream it's recorded
on let's take a look at what's get on
YouTube get it on YouTube okay just take
a look at what's happening right now the
uh
the big Topic in Washington everyone
concentrates on is the deficit uh for
the public correctly the deficit is not
regarded as much of an issue and it
isn't really much of an issue the issue
is joblessness not a deficit there's a
deficit commission but there's no
joblessness commission uh as far as the
def is deficit is concerned you want pay
attention to it the public has opinions
take a look at the polls overwhelmingly
support higher taxes on the wealthy
which have declined sharply during this
uh stagnation period period of decline
uh higher taxes on the wealthy and
preserve The Limited social benefits uh
the outcome of the deficit commission is
probably going to be the opposite uh
either they'll reach an agreement which
will be the opposite of what the public
wants or else it goes into a kind of
automatic U procedure which is going to
have those effects actually that's
something that has to be done very
quickly deficit commission is going to
come up with its decision in a couple of
weeks uh the Occupy movements could
provide a mass base for trying to avert
what uh amounts to a dagger pointed at
the heart of the country could have very
negative effects it's an immediate
well without going on in the details
what's being played out for the last 30
years is actually a kind of a nightmare
that was anticipated by the classical
Economist uh you take say Adam
Smith B to read Wealth of Nations he
considered the possibility that uh
merchants and manufacturers in England
might decide to do their business abroad
invest abroad and import from abroad
he said they would profit but England
would be
harmed uh however he went on to say that
they would prefer to uh Merchants
manufacturers would prefer to operate in
their own country what's sometimes
called a home bias so as if by an
invisible hand uh England would be saved
the uh ravages of what's now called
neoliberal
globalization that's a pretty hard
passage to miss
uh in his classic Wealth of Nations
that's the only occurrence of the phrase
invisible hand maybe uh England would be
saved from neoliberal globalization by
an invisible hand his uh the other great
classical Economist David Ricardo
recognized the same thing and hoped that
it wouldn't happen kind of sentimental
hope and it didn't for a long time but
now it's happening the last 30 years
that's exactly what's been
underway for the general population you
know the 99% in the imagery the Occupy
movements it's uh it's been pretty harsh
and it could get worse this could be a
period of irreversible decline for the
1% even more one/ tenth of 1% it's just
fine uh they're uh you know at the top
of the the Richer than ever uh more
powerful than ever controlling the
political system disregarding the public
uh and uh if it can continue sure why
not just what Smith and Ricardo warned
about so for example take a city group
uh one of the most for decades one of
the most uh corrupt of the major kind of
investment banking corporations
repeatedly bailed out by the taxpayer
over and over again starting in the
early Reagan years now once again that
won't run through the corruption you
probably know about it but it's pretty
astonishing a couple of years ago they
came out with a brochure for
investors they urged investors to put
their money in what they call the
plutonomy index they said the country
the world is dividing into plutonomy you
know the rich that supp to buy luxury
goods and so on and that's where the
action is they said their plutonomy
index is way outperforming the stock
market so put your money into it and as
for the rest we set them a drift uh we
nor care about them we don't need them
uh they have to be around to provide a
powerful state which will protect us and
bail us out when we get into trouble but
other than that they essentially have no
function there are sometimes called
These Days the precariat people who live
a precarious existence at the periphery
of society it's not the periphery
anymore it's becoming very substantial
part of the society in the United States
and indeed elsewhere uh and uh this is
considered a good thing so for example
Alan
Greenspan at the time
when little
competition when Allen Greenspan was
still you know St Allen hailed by the
economics profession as one of the
greatest economists of all time this is
before the crash that for which he was
substantially responsible now he was
testifying to Congress in the Clinton
years explaining the wonders of the
great economy that he was supervising
and he said a lot of the the success of
this economy he said is based on
substantially on what he called growing
worker in
security can you announce that they need
to stay off of the grass ROP in
areas
please please stay yeah let's do it this
way please stay off of the roped in
Grass area over there uh that's a very
nicely done organic area and we're
trying to keep it clean you heard him I
guess
well um greenpan uh greenpan testified
that the very successful economy he was
uh supervising which has the properties
I described was based substantially on
growing worker insecurity if working
people are insecure if they're part of
what we now call The precariat Living
precarious existences they're not going
to make demands they're not going to try
to get wages they won't get benefits uh
we can kick them out if we don't like
them and that's good for the health of
the economy
uh that's what's called a healthy
economy technically and he was very
highly praised for this greatly admired
well now the world is indeed splitting
into a plutonomy and a
precariat uh uh again in the imagery of
the Occupy movements the 1% and the 99%
you know not literal numbers but it's
the right picture and uh the plutonomy
is where the action is well it could
continue like this and if it does
continue this U
historic reversal that began in the
1970s could become
irreversible uh that's where we're
heading and the Occupy movements are uh
you know the first real major reaction
popular reaction which could avert this
uh but as I said it's going to be
necessary to face the fact that it's a
long hard struggle you know win
victories tomorrow uh have to go on you
have to form structures that will be
sustained will go on through hard times
and can win major victories now there
are a lot of things that can be done uh
I mentioned before the uh one of those
mics you give me one of those mics
people can hear you better sorry just
keep just keep that one okay I'll keep
this uh I mentioned before that in the
1930 one of the most effective actions
was uh a sit down strike uh the
uh and the reason is very simple that's
just a step before takeover of the
industry well at through the 70s as the
decline was setting in uh there were
some very important events that took
place one was in the late '70s
[Applause]
1977 the US steel uh decided to close
one of its major facilities Youngstown
Ohio and instead of just walking away
the
workforce and the community decided to
get together and uh buy it from us steel
and hand it over to the workforce to run
and turn it into a worker owned worker
management U uh uh
facility they didn't win but uh with
enough popular support they could have
won and it was a partial victory iory is
a topic that aarl perit particularly has
discussed in detail there a partial
Victory because even though they lost it
set off uh other efforts and now
throughout Ohio and in fact in other
places there's a a scattering hundreds
maybe thousands of sometimes not so
small worker owned or at least partially
worker owned Industries which could
become worker managed and that's the
basis for a real Revolution that's how
it takes place it's happening here too
uh just in one of the suburbs of Boston
about a year ago something similar
happened
multinational decided to close down a a
profitable functioning uh manufacturing
facilities doing some high-tech
manufacturing not profitable enough for
them the workforce and the union offered
to buy it and take it over and run it
themselves the
multinational decided to close it down
instead probably for reasons of class
Consciousness I don't think they want
things like this to happen uh if there
had been enough popular support if there
had been something like this movement
that it could have gotten involved they
might have succeeded and there are other
things going on like that in fact some
of them are major so not long ago Obama
took over the Auto industry was
basically owned by the public and there
were a number of things that could have
been done uh one was what was done it
reconstituted so that it can be handed
back to the ownership or very similar
ownership and continue on its
traditional path the other possibility
was to hand it hand it over to the
workforce which owned it anyway uh turn
it into worker own worker managed major
industrial system that's a big part of
the economy and have it produce things
that people need and there's a lot that
we need uh we all know or should know
that the US is extremely backward
globally in uh high tech in highspeed
transportation that's very it's very
serious it not only affects people's
lives it affects the economy it's a a
very serious business just had a
personal story I happened to be giving
talks in France a couple months ago go
and ended up in southern France had to
take a train from Aon Southern Southern
France to the deol airport and Paris it
took 2 hours it's the same distance as
Washington to Boston I don't know if
you've taken that train but it's about
what it was you know 60 years ago when
my wife and I first took it and it's
it's it's a scandal you know but it
could be done they had the capacity to
do it skilled Workforce we've taken a
little support popular support and that
could have made a major change in the
economy just to make it more surreal
while this option was being avoided uh
the Obama Administration was sending its
uh Transportation secretary to Spain to
get contracts for developing High-Speed
Rail for the United States which could
have been done right in the Rust Belt
which is being closed down there's no
economic reasons why this can't happen
these are class reasons
and reflect the lack of popular
political mobilization well things like
this uh continue
[Applause]
with oh
I you can see why I'm not a public
speaker
this okay well I'll just
uh like that that's little little l but
well I I think I've probably talked
enough anyway so let me just say that uh
and I'd like to make more sense turn
this over to public discussion but I
kept to domestic issues and these are by
no means the only ones who all know that
uh there's very dangerous
developments uh in the international
Arena uh including two of them which are
kind of a shadow that hangs over almost
everything we discussed
uh there are for the first time in human
history uh real threats to decent
survival of the species there are two
one is been hanging around for since
1945 it's kind of a miracle of Escape
that that's the threat of nuclear
nuclear war nuclear weapons and though
it isn't being much discussed that
threat is in fact being escalated by
policies of this Administration and its
allies and that something has to be done
about that or we're in real trouble the
other of course is environmental
catastrophe uh the world is practically
every country in the world is taking at
least halting steps towards trying to do
something about it the US is also taking
steps namely to accelerate the threat
the US is the only country major country
that's not not doing something
constructive but is you know not
climbing on the train it's pulling it
backwards uh Congress right now is uh
dismantling
legislation uh instituted by the Nixon
Administration really the last liberal
president the United States literally uh
and it shows you what's been going on
they're dismantling The Limited measures
of the Nixon Administration to try to do
something about what's a growing
emerging catastrophe and this is
connected with a huge propaganda system
perfectly openly declared by the
business world to try to convince people
that it's all just a liberal hoax if I
pay attention to these scientists and
we're really regressing back to the
medieval period it's not a joke now if
that's happening in the most powerful
richest country in history this
catastrophe is in be averted and uh uh
everything else we're talking about
won't matter in a generation or two well
all that's going on right now something
has to be done about it very soon and
very in a dedicated sustained way it's
going to be it's not going to be easy to
perceive there are going to be barriers
difficulties hardships failures it's
inevitable uh but unless the process
that's taking place here elsewhere in
the country and around the world unless
that continues to grow and uh uh becomes
kind of a Major Force in the social and
political world the chances for a decent
future are not very
[Applause]
high so we're open to just a few
questions right now it's a little hard
to see I guess why don't we
take hold on
where this guy he was um I just called
on this person I I think if I'm doing it
I'll do it and I'll call you next as far
as
fixing as far as fixing as far as fixing
the political um political dysfunction
in this country one idea I've heard
mentioned in various places I've heard
mentioned here is happen
a constitutional convention or
constitutional amendment to u to abolish
corporate personhood or to
uh to get corporate money out out of so
hold on just a sec he's talking about
corporate personhood and getting the
money out of that stream in
politics yeah that's U these are very
good things do but uh you can't do this
or anything else unless there's a large
large active popular base uh most the if
the Occupy Movement was you know the
leading force in the country you could
push this forward but remember uh most
people don't know that this is happening
I they may know about it but not know
what it is and among those who do know
polls show that there a lot of support
but that uh assigns a task it's
necessary to get out into the country
and get people to understand what this
is about and what they can do about it
and what the consequences are of not
doing about it not doing anything about
it and corporate po personhood is a
important case in point but pay
attention to what it is we should think
about it if you read the you know we're
supposed to worship the Constitution
these days the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution says that no person shall
be deprived of rights without due
process you know of law well the
founding fathers didn't mean by person
they didn't mean person so for example
there were a lot of creatures of Flesh
and Blood who weren't persons the
indigenous population for example they
didn't have any rights there was a
category of creatures called 3- fifths
human in the Constitution slave
population they weren't persons uh and
then in fact women women were barely
persons so they didn't have rights well
a lot of this was somewhat rectified
over the years the during the Civil War
the 14th Amendment raised the 3 fifths
humans to full humans at least in
principle that that was only in
principle I won't go through what
happened next but at least in principle
now if you come to over the following
years the concept of person was changed
by the courts in two ways one way was to
broaden it to include corporations uh
legal fictions established and sustained
by the state in fact these persons later
became the management of Corporations
according to the Court decisions so the
management of Corporations they became
Persons Of course that's not what not
what the 14th Amendment say it was also
narrowed to uh undocumented
uh uh immigrants they had to be excluded
from the category of persons and that's
happening right now so the legislations
that you're talking about uh they go two
ways they broaden the category of
persons to include corporate persons
which by now have rights Way Beyond
human beings given by the trade
agreements and others and they exclude
uh people who flee from uh you know
Central America where the US devastated
their homelands free from Mexico because
they can't uh uh they can't compete with
the uh uh us say highly subsidized us
Agro business uh uh remember when NAFTA
was passed in
1994 Clinton administration understood
pretty well that it was going to
devastate the Mexican economy and that's
the year when they started militarizing
the Border well okay now we're getting
the
consequences and uh these people have to
be excluded from the category of persons
so when you talk about personhood that's
right but there's more than one aspect
to it and it ought to be pushed forward
and all ought to be understood and acted
upon but that requires a mass base it
requires that the population understands
this and is committed to it so it's it's
easy to think of a lot of things that
should be done but they all have a
prerequisite namely a mass popular base
is there which is committed to
implementing
[Applause]
them and we have a question about the
ruling class in America How likely is it
that they will have an open fascist
system
here I think it's very unlikely
frankly uh the uh they don't have the
force uh about a century ago uh in the
freest countries in the the world
Britain in the United States the uh at
that time the you know the dominant
classes uh came to understand that they
can't control the population by force
any longer too much Freedom had been won
by struggles like these uh at uh so they
and they realized it I mean it's
self-conscious discussed in their
literature and they recognized they're
going to have to shift tactics to
control of attitudes
and beliefs instead of just the cudle um
you know throw away the cudle but it's
not uh can't do what it used to do you
have to control attitudes and beliefs
and in fact that's when the uh public
relations industry began began in United
States and England the free countries
where you had to have a major industry
to control beliefs and attitudes to
induce consumerism induce passivity
apathy distraction all the things things
you know very well and that's the way
it's been going on but you know it's a
it's a barrier but it's a lot easier to
overcome than you know torture and you
know the gapo I I don't think they are
any more in
the the circumstances exist any longer
for instituting anything like what we
called
[Applause]
fascism excellent and John from the
library would like to ask his question
and then I have a few notes here if you
stand up I will pass a note card to you
and if you could write your question
I've got one question over here and one
question over there headed towards me
but if you stand up we'll try to fit in
a few
others sir I have a two-part question
that I've been waiting to ask you my
whole life um you mentioned earlier that
sit down protests were just precursors
to uh a takeover of Industry I'd ask
like I would like to ask you if today
you would Advocate a general enal strike
as an effective tactic moving forward
and second if would you ever if asked
allow for your voice to relay The
democratically Chosen will of our
nation I'm not sure I my voice wouldn't
help I can't even reach you but and
besides you don't want leaders you want
to do it yourself not that I could be
one need representation in the
international table we need
representation but you should pick at
yourselves and they should be recallable
Representatives so you're not going to
fall into some system of control and
hierarchy uh but it's the question of
the general strike is like the others
you can't it's you can think of it as a
possible idea at a time when the
population is ready for it we can't like
we can't sit here and declare a general
strike obviously uh there has to be
approval U agreement willingness to take
the risks to participate on the part of
the large mass of the population and
that takes organization
education uh activism education doesn't
mean just uh you know telling people
what to believe it means learning
ourselves famous line of Carl marks
which I'm sure you all know that the the
task is not just to understand the world
but to change it and there's a variant
of that which also should be kept in
mind if you want to change the world in
a constructive Direction you better try
to understand it first and understanding
it doesn't mean listening to a talk
reading a book uh although that's
helpful sometimes it means learning and
learning you learn through participation
you learn from others you learn from the
people you're trying to organize uh and
you have to gain the experience and
understanding which will make it
possible to uh maybe to Implement ideas
like that as a tactic but there's a long
way to go that doesn't happen by a flick
of a wrist that happens by hard
long-term dedicated work and I think in
many ways maybe the most exciting aspect
of the Occupy Movement uh is just the
construction of these uh associations
and bonds linkages and others that are
taking place all over the all over
whether it's a Cooperative kitchen or
something else and out of that if they
can be sustained can come and expanded
to the large part of the population that
don't even know what's going on if that
can happen then you can raise questions
about tactics like this which could
could very well at some point be
appropriate
