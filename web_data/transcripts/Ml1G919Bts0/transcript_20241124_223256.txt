hi thank
you thank you very much are you excited
I
am it's is going to be I hope a
remarkable evening and I hope we'll get
it done in less than five or 6
hours uh I want to say that we're going
to through the format uh that you many
of you used to we we'll we're n and I
are going to have a dialogue which is
going to go a little longer than normal
because there's a lot more stuff to talk
about then we're going to have an
intermission and you can Scurry down
with your questions and and and there'll
be people here to take them uh and also
this for this the first time you can
tweet your questions and they'll be um
recorded backstage and then we'll be
choosing them and then we'll come out
and answer questions um I am this is for
me perhaps one of the hardest dialogues
I I've been involved in in the origins
project uh because of uh the individual
I'm about to have the dialogue with
[Music]
uh gome Chomsky is so many things and
you know many of them in your program
one could call him the father of modern
Linguistics establishing essentially a
whole field which is itself a rare thing
to do he's written over a 100
books he was named in at least several
surveys as the top public intellectual
in the world and certainly in 2005 and
twice since then in at least one survey
the most one of the most influential
thinkers of the 20th century this is all
said without hyperbole that is
substantiated because one of the things
I learned from gnome is to always try
and substantiate
claims um he has been cited more than
any other living scholar in the
humanities and arts between 1980 and
1992 he besides being an incredible
intellectual he came to the
public domain during the Vietnam war
during which he he bravely was one of
the first people to openly protest and
Led Led much of the protest against the
Vietnam War which during which he became
an American
during which he certainly became a uh an
American hero it established a tradition
for him of being
marginalized in Us
Media uh we were just noticing some of
you may have seen the New York Times
online that there was a uh interview
with him on on racism uh it's the on the
it's in online you won't find it in the
in the in the hard copy because the last
time gnome was uh uh interviewed or
quoted in the New York Times was in
1970s um which says something which
we'll get to in this in this
discussion the this is also a very
personal um moment for me and I would be
disingenuous not to mention it because
I'm sure it'll creep in I I'm not a big
believer in hero worship because you
usually are
disappointed uh but I do have a few
intellectual Heroes too to be exact and
um people that I would like to I always
thought I want to emulate if I ever got
to be in a position even remotely like
theirs those two people are Richard
Fineman who I wrote a book about and Nom
Chomsky I had the opportunity to know
both of them but I I I got to know gnome
when I was a a graduate student at MIT
MIT has the wisdom to uh not require you
to take any courses if you're a graduate
student which was wonderful so I didn't
take any physics
classes uh but I took two courses in US
foreign policy from n
Chomsky and it was a revelation to
me the
um the first thing that personally
impressed me about him was was a man who
took time out from a field that he
clearly loved
Linguistics to talk about issues that
matter to people the courses that he
taught for me at MIT were courses that
weren't on the on the curriculum he he
just voluntarily taught these courses in
addition to his regular greekin because
he thought they were
important as a graduate student not in
linguistics but in physics I would walk
into his office periodically and sit
down and ask him a question and we would
talk for an hour and I was just
overwhelmed that he took me seriously he
showed me a kind of respect which I did
not
expect and the last thing was that when
I went and gnome spends a lot of his
time and as always spent a lot of his
time out in public and in Cambridge
there many times when I was fortunate
enough to go listen to him and what
impressed me was not just his
discussions but afterwards he answered
questions well past midnight to the last
person that asked the question he showed
a kind of respect and generosity for
people's interests that I've that is not
common in most public
intellectuals and I I always hoped that
I would try and emulate those things and
and and uh every time I'm into that
situation I think of gnome and some
people say what would Jesus do but I ask
what would gnome
do so it is therefore one of
the it is therefore one of the truly
greatest honors of my life to welcome
onto the stage Nom Chomsky
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
we can go a few hours with just that but
um
this is
uh very difficult for me because um
there's so much to talk about and I want
to cover and um I did something that I
haven't done since I was a first year
undergraduate I assigned myself five
books to read this week of yours and I
finished the last one at 300 in the
morning this morning last time I did
that was a Sociology class in my first
year when I hadn't read any of the text
until the night before the exam and um
we'll see if you pass yeah that's right
this was much more fun but that I think
is appropriate because I want to begin
with your background speaking of of not
reading the assign text
um in an interview you said uh we were
talking about your college experience
you said I was probably lucky in that
respect I really never went to college
you want to
elaborate well I was in an academic high
school for college oriented kids and uh
it was very boring couldn't stand it but
I was really looking forward the college
the uh University of Pennsylvania the
catalog looked very exciting all kind of
wonderful topics but when I got there I
found that each course was just a
duplicate of the kind of thing that was
going on in high school so boring I lost
interest in that topic and after about a
year I was ready to drop out when kind
of by AC in independent accident through
political uh shared political interests
I happened to meet uh zelich Harris who
was the leading theoretical linguist in
the country and uh he suggested to me
that I start taking his graduate courses
and then suggested other graduate
courses in mathematics philosophy
psychology I started taking those and
they were they were interesting I got
caught up in them and uh but I never had
an undergraduate education and I never
had any professional training uh
professional credentials in any field it
was just kind of an Eclectic mixture
would you advise that career path for
others well it turned out to be lucky
for me but you have to survive in this
world and without credentials it's part
we'll talk about credentials later but
you've talked about
teaching and there are a few things
things you've written that I want to um
you actually quoted some
actually Catholic priests in in Latin
America some of the The Liberation
priests talking about the teaching and
they said that the the problem with the
teaching there is that people teachers
were more preoccupied with the
transmission of knowledge than with the
creation among other values of a
critical spirit from the social point of
view the Educational Systems are
oriented to maintaining the existing
social and economic structures instead
of transforming them do you think this
is a general characteristic of Education
it's and I think it's more General than
it's not Universal of course there are
exceptions but uh substantially I think
that's probably true most all of you can
check your own experience and see
whether it's true the idea of educating
people to challenge to think for
themselves to create to challenge what
you saying for example that's what an
educational objective really should be
you're not uh uh giving the uh student
body orders saying here's what you must
believe but U here's what I think and
you tell me whether it's right does that
is that impact on your teaching the way
you try and teach that's the way I try
you can tell whether it
succeeded it worked for me
um there's one thing though that you
wrote which I kind of took to heart a
little bit or I don't know whether I
took to heart but um there's a really
interesting discussion of the fact that
Gandhi apparently thought
that persuasion was a form of violence
and you wrote
um if you're with children or teaching
or involved in a discussion or talking
to an audience ideally you should not
try to persuade them that is to get them
to accept your position and then you
went on to say this should be true of
teaching there's no PO point in
persuading people if you're teaching say
physics which I thought was a good
choice there's no point in persuading a
student that you're right you want to
encourage them to find out what the
truth is which is probably that you're
wrong very often yeah and which is which
is a really important point about
teaching but I was particularly taken
with something that you wrote
afterwards uh for reasons that may be
clear it said I'm always put off by
people who are called good Speakers by
those who can Rouse an audience that's
just what you do not want if you have
the capacity to do it you should
suppress
it and uh I thought I thought you I want
get you
elaborate I think that's right an
orator rhetoric is the uh art or science
whatever you call it of persuading
people by appealing to their emotions
they U you know getting undermining
their capacity for independent thought
and inquiry for challenge for invention
for creation it's exactly the opposite
of what it ought to be I mean uh uh I
have
heard speakers who were inspiring and I
can understand the appeal but people
should resist it I think okay so I've
been trying to think of things to
disagree with you on here and it can be
hard but let me put it to you this way
that I've I've often with my with
Richard Dawkins debated the question of
how to convince people or how to get
people to think critically and have said
that that that you really teaching is
really seduction in a way because you
can't assume people are interested in
what you have to say if you do then then
you've lost a lot of them so it seems to
me that if you're really interested in
getting the step of critical thinking
you first have to motivate people to
want to think critically or to want to
be interested enough the topic to think
critically and that's where if you wish
the idea of sort of rousing and and
interest and I don't think if you if you
can unless you pass that natural sort of
suspicion that I don't think you can get
people to the crit thinking critically
unless you sort of the right way to
motivate people is to bring up U issues
problems puzzles that challenge them and
then ask them try to think through get
help them to Think Through uh ways of uh
uh interpreting U maybe solving uh these
problems there's an old uh
if you go back to the enlightenment
there were kind of two models
counterposed for teaching one was the
concept of pouring a liquid into a
vessel and uh we've all been through
that and as we all know it's a pretty
leaky vessel you when you memorize those
uh books to pass the sociology test a
week later I'll bet you forgot what the
topic was I was like Woody Allen I
remember his l about I I read I took a
speed reading course and read war in
peace in 5 minutes it's about Russia
anyway but uh the the other model which
was counterposed to this was laying out
a string along which the student which
the student pursues in his or her own
way uh so there's some structure to uh
education but U the real task is to make
it possible for the student
to pursue to investigate that structure
to explore it maybe to modify it could
be the wrong structure and if you if you
succeed in that you've actually taught
well let me give you an example the best
uh Math course I ever took graduate
course in U modern algebra back in the
1940s uh the instructor who was a very
good mathematician uh would come in race
the black Bo board they write down
something on the Blackboard look at it
and ask the class is that a theorem and
the rest of the session was the efforts
of the class to either prove or disprove
what was up there the instructor of
course participated if things went in
the wrong direction maybe give you some
hints but uh it was basic the task was
not look this is a theorem here's where
I'm going to prove it but you find out
whether this is a theorem or this is
false and that way you actually learn
something you learn how to be a
mathematician not just to discover
whether that thing written there is true
or false to discover for yourself which
is really the only way and then it's
internalized yeah then it's internalized
which is I think one of the reasons that
that graduate students should be
encouraged to not take classes actually
is to unless they're classes like this
yeah exactly that was an amazing class
well that motivated you in some sense to
become a scientist which
um we were talking backstage a little
bit I asked if you wanted if you thought
you'd want to be a scientist early on
and and and maybe you can answer that
here well actually when I was about 10
years old I told my mother that I wanted
to be a
taxidermist and the reason was cuz the
word sounded interesting
okay but after that I was uh you know
smelling up the house for my chemistry
set and that sort of thing and uh uh I
did want actually I wanted I was quite
interested in chemistry uh which has a
certain similarity to Linguistics it's
the study of structures what creates
them how they interact and so on and so
forth I got attracted to Linguistics
partly for just reasons of background
accidents but partly because it uh
struck me right away that uh this is
an an Avenue gives you access to the the
nature of the human mind I didn't know
it at that time but this tradition going
back centuries which uh quite plausibly
regards language as the unique and
distinctive property of human beings as
distinct from other animals not just
language itself but the capacity to use
language in a a creative Innovative way
if you go back say they cart famous
distinction between body and mind his
his actual the Criterion that he
suggested for distinguishing a human
being with a mind from an animal or
machine which in his metaphysics didn't
have a mind was the ability of every
human uh no matter what their
intelligence uh to
speak creatively to produce thoughts to
express them uh without limit unbounded
infinite and to do it in a way which is
appropriate to
circumstances not caused by
circumstances so not a reflexive
response to something that's happening
but in ways that somehow are right for
the occasion so like right now we're
we're not talking about say a soccer
match that took place this afternoon
wouldn't be appropriate we're trying to
formulate and create create and
articulate thoughts which are relevant
to the circumstances of this meeting and
people do that all the time that's
normal in fact the if you stop to think
about it probably 99% of your use of
language never even gets expressed it's
internal you can't it's it takes a
tremendous Act of will not to do what we
call talking to yourself in fact I want
to pick up on that yeah no in fact I
want to pick up on that in a minute but
before we get there there's something
else you said that surprised me which um
because you often and it it pleased me
you often sort of compare Linguistics
and some social sciences to physics um
and and we'll we'll get to that but I
mean the the the virtue of physics is
that that it's it's simple it's it's EAS
the irrelevant details are easily
removed whereas as as we'll talk about
you often bemoan that in linguistics and
in cognitive science uh the the ability
to really make detailed progress is very
difficult because of all of the all of
the factors and and and yet and so
Linguistics is is
um much therefore less uh advanced than
physics and you said to me that was an
attraction when when and I was surprised
to hear about that so it's an attraction
but I think what you described is also
true of early physics so if you go back
to say the 17th century uh Galileo had
quite a hard time in convincing the uh
Thunders the aristocrats that it made
sense to study something that doesn't
exist in nature like a ball rolling down
a frictionless plane uh when they
thought if you're studying motion why
don't you study the growth of flowers
something that's real and the the way
the leaves blow in the wind and so on
and so forth it took a long time for
physics to get to the point where it
became comprehended that if you want to
understand the diversity and complexity
of the phenomena of the world you're
going to have to study highly idealized
abstract uh models even things which
don't exist in the natural world like
say a in frictionless plan and then it's
not that so much you throw away
everything else you hope maybe somehow
you'll get back to it but that and
that's the situation in the stud study
of language in the
1950s I mean the study of language was
the study of all the phenomena that you
could accumulate so the way when I was a
student for example late
1940s uh the your task was take some
language say Cherokee and get a
collection of data from it with an
informant you know some speaker text or
something and then organize that that
data uh put it in
segment the sentences categorize what's
there you're finished structural
description that's the end uh that which
includes everything that happens right
yeah and it was also missing
crucially uh the basic element that you
should be studying namely what's going
on in here you know what's going on in
the mind of the speaker of that language
that enabled
him or her to produce and comprehend not
only that data but uh infinitely many
more now that shift from the external
data which you organize to the study of
the internal processes that enable a
person to interpret comprehend create uh
uh thoughts and expressions that's a
huge difference did and you have to
recall that this was the era of
Behavioral Science which when the the
idea was that psychology is just the
study of what You observe and
organization and control of What You
observe it's a very strange notion
Behavioral Science it's kind of as if uh
physics was called meter reading science
because that's the data and then you
organize the data but which you want to
you want to move from Behavioral Science
to authentic science you move it from
What You observe to what's internally
going on in the mind of the person uh
which uh plans organized directs uh
interprets The observed data were you
intellectually mature enough I mean was
was the fact that the field wasn't
scientific in the sense that you and I
would describe as science was that an
attraction I mean I often think how nice
it would have been to be you know all
the lwh hanging fruit in physics has
sort of been taken and that's a lot
harder and was that an attract in some
sense that it was just open for for that
kind of activity were were you mature
enough to realize that or was that after
the fact well actually um there's an
actual parallel between
what this development and the study of
language and the earli stages of modern
physics so if you go back to say the
15th century uh scientists had an answer
to everything like if I if this thing
has uh boiling water in it and I let go
the steam goes up and the container goes
down and there's an explanation for that
they're both going to their natural
place uh if uh two things are repelling
one another or attracting one another
it's because of what we're called
sympathies and antipathies that's the
way it works uh if uh I perceive this
thing what's happening is the form of
this object is moving through the air
getting into my eye and is implanted in
my brain so there's an answer to the
problems of perception it was when
Galileo his contemporaries uh began to
allow themselves to be puzzled about
this and ask you know what's going on
how is this working then they quickly
discovered that they didn't understand
anything they didn't have answers to any
questions instead of having answers to
all questions that had answers to none
because everything was puzzling and
that's the beginning of modern science
and that's pretty much what happened in
the
1950s it was assumed at the time that we
basically know everything Linguistics in
in the study of language and it was also
assumed that the natural consequence of
that was that languages could be uh
unboundedly diverse there's no limit to
what could be a language and each one
has to be studied on its own without any
preconceptions about what a language
might be soon as you began to ask what
questions about why does it work this
way not some other way what's going on
in the internal process that's
determining these and innumerable other
data you quickly discover that every
sentence you look at as a puzzle you
don't understand why it's that way not
some other way and you find some very
strange things very quickly so let's
let's talk about some of those strange
things one of when I was
reading recent work discussions of yours
on language and and mind one of the
things that struck me is related to
something you just said which was
surprised me because someone was asking
you we often talk about and I've been
many of the meetings we've run here on
on extinctions and and origins of early
modern humans the importance of language
in communication but you made the point
that in fact you from an evolutionary
perspective at least as far as you can
see what's important about language has
nothing to do with communication the
important thing about language is not
external but internal maybe you can
elaborate well in fact uh
traditionally it
was the a guiding idea was that language
is primarily an instrument of thought
the idea that language is uh that
language is U designed for communication
is a pretty modern view I guess those I
guess the microphones we have are not
working not wor good we'll start again
no we just
go anyway go on sorry sorry well the
there's a traditional view which I think
is correct that uh the core uh property
of language is its uh use in creating
and uh formulating thought it's an
instrument of thought there's a modern
view that language evolved uh as an
instrument of
communication I think the reason for
that is probably a misunderstanding of
Darwinism
the it's based on the assumption that
any change that took place must be some
small change modifying what was already
there actually Darwin at one point even
said that if that's not true his whole
Theory collapses which is now known not
to be the case but uh if if you look
closely animal communication systems and
human language differ radically in every
respect you can think of so for example
every animal communication system known
consists of uh signals which are keyed
to external events so say a a monkey say
reesus monkey one of the ones that's
extensively studied has maybe half a
dozen calls and if the leaves are moving
a certain way a CO comes out which we
interpret to be a warning call you know
maybe there's an eagle out there you
better hide uh if there's a hormonal
change change another call come out
which we interpret as meaning I'm hungry
or something like that the human
language is not like that at all it's a
free creative activity uh it can be used
for communication but primarily it's
just used for thinking and as I started
to say before you if you simply
introspect uh almost all of your use of
languages internally creating and
interpreting thought
uh and if you look at the structure of
language it's completely different from
animal communication systems furthermore
it's gets kind of complicated but uh if
you actually look at the carefully at
the design of language it turns out that
the externalization the articulation
what comes out your mouth uh is kind of
peripheral to language it the core
principles of language are those that
determine how you construct and
interpret thoughts and the way it's
externalized doesn't enter into that uh
it's you takes some work to show that
but I think there's considerable
evidence for it uh and uh that I think
all of that reinforces the traditional
view that language is fundamentally what
was sometimes called audible thought and
we know it doesn't have to be audible
could be ins sign could be any sensory
mode
modality that's kind of all of the
sensory modality that's used is um
external too and peripheral to and not
really part of the core of language
which is a system of creating uh
creating inventing interpreting thoughts
okay well if say that I know that that
your thinking changed dramatically and
in a way which as we'll talk about as a
physicist seems natural to me but but um
that the
key evolutionary development that
produce language was rather actually
rather simple and quick and that really
um
uh the fundamental idea of language may
come down to one or two things something
I think you've B the minimalist
principle something called merge which
you may get to but maybe you want to
explain why you think that from an
evolutionary perspective well actually
um there's a huge huge literature on
something called evolution of language
which a very curious phenomenon for one
reason because subject doesn't exist
languages don't evolve they may change
but they don't evolve what evolves is
the capacity for language that's and
that's quite a crucial difference the
capacity for language is something in
your head every human head now we know a
few things about the evolution of this
capacity very little uh one thing which
we know with a high degree of confidence
is that the capacity for language is
identical or virtually identical across
all humans so for example if you take a
an infant from a tribe in papon new
guine which hasn't had contact with
other humans for 40,000 years which is
possible and you bring that uh infant
here the Phoenix it'll grow up exactly
like children in Phoenix
it'll speak the same language it'll
become a Quantum physicist whatever you
maybe if it's if it's
unlikely but and
conversely now humans left East our
ancestors began to leave East Africa
maybe 50 60,000 years ago so what that
tells us is in that period there has
been no evolution of the language
capacity it's exactly what it was then
and maybe some time before now the
second fact which is a plausible
speculation rather than firmly
established is that if you go back
shortly before that there's no evidence
for language at all the evidence in this
case is
archaeological and what it shows is that
there's a kind of a sudden burst of
creative activity in one line of the
many hominin species that were around
our ancestors and uh you see it in the
construction of complex tools and uh
evidence for the existence of complex
social
organizations symbolic uh symbolic
representation even pretty fantastic
symbolic art uh measurement of celestial
events Maybe by you know phases of the
moon and so on all of this happens in a
very short time from an evolutionary
point of view maybe roughly um say
75,000 years ago plus or minus now
that's what that tells you is that
whatever this capacity is that
distinguishes humans from other
organisms must have developed very
quickly and therefore must have been
very simple in fact what it suggests is
that what's in the mind uh was is
basically something like kind of like a
snowflake it takes a complex form but
just by virtue of the laws of nature not
because of some evolutionary process
that's just the way it has to be because
of the way nature works now a language
is a computational system a very unusual
feature of human language very unusual
within the whole biological world is it
has a property called discrete Infinity
so this a six-word sentence there's a
seven-word sentence but there's no six
and a halfword sentence and it goes on
indefinitely that's different from
almost anything in the biological world
now such systems are understood uh by
mid 20th century thanks to the work of
touring girdle others the general theory
of computation involving such systems
was quite well understood and that
suggests to us that that's exactly what
emerged sometime say roughly 75,000
years ago uh and all of the diversity
and complexity of language must somehow
either derive directly from that or be
peripheral to language like the way in
which it's articulated by the mouth the
sensory motor system has been around for
hundreds of thousands of years and our
effort to take this internal Snowflake
and get it out of your mouth is a
complicated process and it's pretty well
understood by now that that's where the
that external process really peripheral
to language is where the complexity and
diversity of language resides also its
mutability that changes quite easily
when you learn a language that's what
you learn you don't learn the internal
principles that determine the meaning
and structure of Expressions you one of
the reasons you can't you don't learn
that is there's no data for it the child
is not presented with any evidence for
that uh what you are presented with
evidence for is things like
pronunciation uh word order you know the
what morphological paradigms do you do
you do you use do Express plural or
don't you express it things like that
that's what you have to learn but it's
all external to language the internal
part what probably
evolved say in that brief window is must
must be something extremely simple and
invariant same for all languages now you
pointed out uh to me when we were
talking about this again last stage that
we should put a a c a caveat here that
the views you express are your views and
in
fact you would argue that most it's
there a minority among among modern Ling
tiny minority and I'm not trying to
persuade you remember
yeah but you're supposed to investigate
to see whether this makes any sense I
want one question I want to ask is why
is that because again as a most of the
physical scientists in the audience I
mean that
just as a physicist and and we call it
reductionism or some people don't like
that but we've been very success the
world around us is very very complicated
but it seems natural to explain it in
terms of very simple principles and
we've been very very successful over 400
years at doing just that it seems to me
me kind of kind of obvious if you were
going to approach this that that's what
you'd look for what's why the resistance
in linguis that was 400 years This is 40
years okay if you look back at the again
at the I think the the right place to
look is the early stages of modern
science my my own feeling is that
psychology and study of humans study of
human thinking action interpretation is
really pre-scientific it's pre Galilean
it's got a move it has to find a way to
move into the era of science that
involves many changes one I already
mentioned the crucial one it requires
the ability to be puzzled about what you
see to be puzzled about the phenomena to
comprehend that the apparent diversity
and complexity of phenomena must be
superficial there's absolutely no way to
acquire a language or other you know
cognitive skills on the basis of just
say induction from data can't be done
and the uniformity and
uh the the in the way in which these
skills capacities develop is actually
very much like physical growth like you
don't learn how to have arms and legs
you're designed to have arms and legs
well let's not use the word design can
we
design just means it's somewhere in your
genetic apparatus just to be clear about
that I yeah design doesn't mean somebody
designed but know let me let me jump on
that because when I was reading it I man
maybe I you may have used a analogy
yourself I don't think I got it from you
but when I was thinking about your
approach to language it seems to me it's
very similar to the to thinking about
the eye in the sense that we don't learn
how to see it's not something that that
you know is is cultur or or or that we
get we we have a a mechanism that allows
to see now that once we can see of
course and children do learn how to use
their site I mean in many different ways
that're they're born with the sensory
ability of although of course they need
the experience to be able to use it to
to then to then see things but in very
different ways in incredibly complex
manifestations and it seem to me in some
sense your view of language is it's very
much like thinking about seeing well in
fact a lot a lot is known about human
vision uh in there's a reason for that
we experiment with cats and monkeys and
they have and we do invasive experiments
which are not permitted to do with
humans uh and they have about the same
visual system uh so therefore we know
something about the visual system of
humans and notice you can't do that with
language because there is no other
organism that has the capacity so you
can't investigate with invasive
experiments with other organisms but
from the study of cats and monkeys we've
learned a lot about this so for example
there were classic experiments roughly
50 years ago uh which showed that if you
take say a kitten which is u a newborn
kitten and you U blind it for you close
you sew its eyelids together essentially
so it can't see for a couple of weeks it
will never see it has to have
experience in that particular Fe period
in order for the system to develop in
fact the cells actually degenerate if
it's not done it's and furthermore other
experiments showed that the kitten has
to be have pattern stimulation so if it
has diffuse stimulation like if you put
something over the eye which just gives
diffuse light then the system
degenerates can't develop now that's
every bi ological system of growth
that's known has properties like that
and does a language I mean there's a few
cases of wild child I mean there are a
few cases where it wasn't done by
scientists but where children were not
exposed to language or or uh that level
of communication and their ability to
manifest language was was produced
actually a lot of this is lore but there
are some real cases that have been
studied uh the case that's best known
which some of you may know about is a
girl who's called Genie there books
about you be careful about the books
many of them are not true but uh we'll
get to that in fact there's there's a
good study by the scientist who actually
worked with her Susan Curtis this is a
girl who was uh locked in a room uh tied
to a chair uh uh by a psychotic uh
father food was thrown to her stayed
alive but she had no linguistic
experience
uh except for the first year or two of I
think it was two years of life which may
be significant but when she was finally
found at about age 12 or so and of
course released and efforts were made to
teach her language uh and S of bring her
into the world she was as you can guess
she was totally psychotic I mean all
deranged it's quite an experience but
she was very clever and at first she uh
deceived her exper her therapists and
the scientists observing her into
thinking that she actually was acquiring
language but closer investigation showed
that that was not happening whatever the
requirement is analogous to the first
couple of weeks of life or Vision she
apparently didn't have and that meant
that the ability to acquire language
probably was lost now there aren't many
cases like that then but that's appears
to be the case that difficulty of of of
doing those kind of experiments for
ethical reasons is you is interesting
because of course it limits one's
ability
to to understand a very complicated
thing which is human language one of the
points you make is that um bees of
course communicate they have their
languages and but and in principle you'd
be able to do much experiment but they
far more books and work on human
language inp the fact evolution of human
the evolution of human language in spite
of the fact that you have this system
which you can access and it's very
striking it's it's I if you look in the
library uh for books on evolution of
language that's the wrong name as I said
it should be the evolution of linguistic
capacity huge Library take a look at the
you'll have to take a look at on the
internet because you're not going to
find the library uh for studies of the
evolution of the B Communication System
very very few and that's very striking
because a be has the they have a
complicated Communication System a lot
of's known about it uh B has a brain the
size of a grass seed I think 800,000
neurons as a very brief gestation period
as you said you can do any experiment
you like you don't need permission forms
and so on it's a perfect uh organism to
study so why is evolution of the be
system not studied it's too hard and if
it's hard then human language is is much
harder human language is incomparably
harder but there's a huge Library about
it you know yeah I by the way I I bring
this up because one of the many
wonderful things about ASU is that we
have a huge insect uh communication and
social social insect St group that does
study at least social in communication
and the best in the world is done here I
think um uh and even the uh uh the
Neurology of it is not really well
understood uh and that again is
something in in fact it's even more so
than that one of one of the most studied
organisms is uh what are called
nematodes C elegant it's a tiny little
worm uh maybe 800 cells has about 300
neurons the wiring diagrams
completely understood but to try to
figure out what that thing is doing is
turn that be extremely hard yeah that I
mean that's why I tell my biologist
friends that's why I do physics because
it's so much easier um uh but
uh but the interesting thing is I think
it's a property I have friends in I
actually I know in the audience very
interesting Consciousness and there's a
theorem I think that that the that
there's an inverse relationship between
what is known in a field and the number
of books that are written about it and
and Consciousness is everywhere and
whereas I mean if you got
gravity you just need one book right and
and and that's all you need so I I don't
if you know the answer you don't have a
lot of book exactly now in fact actually
I this is a quote of yours that that I
liked um it said um the study of the
formal properties of language reveals
something of the nature of humans in a
negative way it underscores with great
clarity the limits of our understanding
of those qualities of mind that are
apparently unique to humans and that
must enter into their cultural
achievements in an intimate if still
quite obscure manner so I think in some
sense the lesson is that we have to be
humble at least the fact if you go back
I mentioned before de cart's uh proposed
distinction between body and mind that
we don't accept that framework anymore
but what he observed what he namely the
inherently
creative character of the way language
is used for creation and expression of
thought uh that he didn't understand
that and we know nothing about it
nothing uh same mystery and this holds
for voluntary action altogether not just
language so I we're were talking about
it before there's a recent uh review by
a very good scientist of uh what's known
about the U how voluntary action uh
is it takes place so let's say my
reading reaching for this
uh and what he points then he goes
through what's known about the neurology
the muscles what the neurons are doing
and so on but he ends up by saying we're
now beginning to understand the puppet
and the strings but we don't know
anything about the mind of the Puppeteer
nothing so what is making me pick this
up rather than you know take this and
throw it on the floor about that nothing
is known so yes we have to be very
humble that's
uh hundreds of years we're exactly as
ignorant as before and we don't even
know how to investigate it now in that
regard I I know I want to slowly segue
to the other part of your experience and
uh which is you wrote a wonderful essay
called language and freedom um before I
get there though it seems to me what the
motivation to study language was to
understand something which you often
talk about as human nature I was going
to ask you what I I still don't quite
know what human the word mean the phrase
means human nature but but you seemed
attractive attracted to the notion that
understanding human nature would help us
understand social interactions an issue
that was that has been and clearly is
very important to when get there and and
you attracted and written a lot about
rouso now I remember rouso Jean jacqu
rouso had a big impact on me when I read
him the social contract because of that
famous phrase man is Born Free but lives
forever in Chains which which took me a
long time to understand and um but but
but rouso had this idea which which in
your writing you've uh repeated a number
of times that somehow the natural state
of man and we'll just use man for that
moment here um uh is a good one and
somehow Society screws that up so for
example you wrote um actually at the
time of American draft resistors you
were saying um uh many who were to
recover from the catastrophe of 20th
century Western Civilization which is so
tragically confirmed Russo's judgment
and he wrote here arose the national
Wars battles murders and reprisals which
Make nature tremble and shook reason and
all those horrible prejudices which rank
the honor of shedding human blood among
among the virtues the most decent men
learned to consider it one of their
duties to murder their fellow men at
length men were seen to Massacre each
other by the thousands without knowing
why
more murders were committed on a single
day of fighting and more Horrors in the
capture of a single city than were
committed in the state of nature during
whole centuries over the entire face of
the earth now is that really it seems to
me that that's wrong that's Roso that's
Roso but I mean you quoted it and the
question is do you agree with that I
mean it seems to me that in fact one of
your former colleague Steve Pinker has
written a book the better angels of our
nature that in fact if you wanted to
choose choose a time to be
around and have a happy non-violent life
today is a lot better than than when you
being being around at Neanderthal times
well that's what he claims but the
weight of evidence is strongly against
it you think so uh I think so there's
very good work by a serious
Anthropologist Brian Ferguson is one
who's worked through his data I think
shown that it's probably wrong for about
95% of human existence the hunter
gatherer periods it's really with the
emergence of State systems the
development of complex agriculture they
begin to get Wars that are very
destructive I mean there's killing among
hunter gatherers you know but it's
pretty limited but there has been moral
progress in fact you wrote well one
thing that he says is correct I think
that's about it uh since since the since
the
enlightenment there has been moral
progress uh in our own lifetimes there's
been moral progress so consider for
example U the status of women's rights
today and in
1950 very different the status of civil
rights very different the gay rights
very different that's progress and it's
been going on slowly since the
enlightenment but that's a pretty brief
period of human history it's and in fact
right at this same time have been the
most murderous destructive Wars ever and
even the 70 years ago the creation by
some of the smartest people in the world
of an a device that may destroy us all
and is on the verge of destroying us we
we'll get to that as you know I'm I'm
the chairman of the board of Bly Atomic
scientist it's an issue that's really of
great interest to me you actually just
reproduced a quote I was going to talk
about for years it that there that there
has been moral progress in many ways
status of women in particular talk about
your daughters versus your grandmother
but it and you say it's fairly brief but
don't you think it's interesting that
that coincides with the rise of science
do you think that's
coincidental no it's not coincidental
part of the con contribution of the
Enlightenment was to free inquiry from
constraints uh which led to the rise of
science so Breaking Free of these fets
that Society had opposed uh uh did
permit the rise of science did permit
moral progress uh also permitted massive
destruction well now we're going to get
to the massive destruction and you're
interested in that it you wrote at one
point and and the transition in this
Lang in this Lang uh language and
freedom which is really trying to
understand what whether your scientific
and intellectual background somehow
motivated in some sense your social Act
ISM can I you say whatever you want take
a look at the first sentence the first
sentence of this article says I've been
asked to talk about language and freedom
there's a lot to say about language
there's a lot to say about freedom but I
have almost nothing to say about and
okay but here's one of the things are
they connected here's one of the things
you did say which I find interesting
which I I want to ask if it motivates
you okay I mean it say I like to believe
that the Intensive study of one aspect
of human psychology human language May
contribute to a humanistic social
science that will serve as well as an
instrument for Social Action I would
like to believe that's crucial yes I
would like to that but has that been a
motivator no no no I'm I'm not saying
you say it has but in in a personal
sense do you think that makes a
connection in your own personal
activism um well if you look at as a
historical fact no they're separate but
there is a kind of a a connection not a
logical connection nothing you can prove
just a suggestive relation and it shows
up in Russo so if you take a look at say
the work of Russo that I quoted which is
the second discourse on inequality
that's his most Libertarian writing yeah
he begins with a pretty strictly
cartisian
view uh of uh animals as being machines
just reflexive machines compelled to do
what they do by internal and external
circumstances without uh the without the
creative character of human thought and
Behavior Uh and he then says again in
roughly cartisian terms that what is
unique and distinctive about humans is
this internal creative capacity that's
what makes humans different from the
rest of the natural world then comes a
thesis which is not proved but I think
is plausible namely any social
Arrangements that inhibit or constrain
that free creative
capacity uh are fundamentally
illegitimate unless they can justify
themselves that means any structure of
authority domination hierarchy whether
it's in a patriarchal family or in
international Affairs or anything in
between should be subject to challenge
it's not self-justifying
there's and
uh I mean you can see the chain of
thinking notice it's not a proof but
beginning with the observation that
specific to human nature a term which I
don't object to we may could talk about
that uh inherent to human nature what's
special about us uh is this uh creative
character the U the free the uh need to
inquire to create to uh act to choose
what you do how you speak how you
interact and so on the there's a there's
a kind kind of a chain of thinking from
that to the conclusion that soal which
is in Vero in fact that uh social
structures which inhibit that uh are
illegitimate unless proved otherwise
like sometimes you can give an argument
in favor of authority so if I'm walking
down the street with say my
three-year-old granddaughter and she
runs into the street and I grab her arm
and pull her back I think I can give it
just ific ation for that but the point
is that any the argument is that any
form of authority and domination
requires
justification and usually you can't
justify it in which case you have to um
dismantle it and replace it by something
more free and just oh this is perfect
this is a great segue this is perfect by
the way I want to let the people
backstage know that we're going going to
go a little long instead of an we're
going to go about 15 minutes longer than
intended and the reason reason is I want
to um so made a
[Music]
choice how did how did you make this
it's such
power um anyway um you wrote a piece in
1966 which changed your life probably in
some ways because it was a piece that
first I imagine for many in the public
brought you the the responsibility of
intellectuals and profoundly important
piece in which you said it's the
responsibility of intellectuals to speak
the truth and expose lies intellectuals
are in a position to expose the laes of
governments to analyze actions according
to their causes and motives and often
hidden intentions in the Western World
at least they have the power that comes
from political Liberty from access to
information and freedom of expression
for a privileged minority Western
democracy provides the Leisure the
facilities and the training to seek the
truth lying hidden beneath the ve of
distortion and
misrepresentation ideology and class
interest through which the events of
current history are presented to us and
uh it seemed to me that that that that
that epitomizes what what has been your
role as a public intellectual is that is
that your is that your guiding
principle whether it's been the role or
not is for you to decide but it's
certainly been the guiding principle
something that ought to be done
and yet at the same time
yeah I should say we're entering the
part of the program where there's going
to be a lot more Applause so we'll get
used to it
um you have at the same time pointed out
at the same time is talking about what
the responsibility of an intellectual is
I spent a great deal of time essentially
castigating intellectuals pointing out
that the role of intellectuals has not
been that the role of intellectuals in
our soci society which I guess I first
learned when I was in your class which
surprised me has really been to be
completely complicit in the lies and
distortions and in fact provide an
underlying Fabric and story on which
those people can then use to to to
discuss that it's unfortunate but as a
fact I think that's a well documented
fact uh remember intellectuals are the
people who write history so they come
out looking pretty good but you've got a
take as usual you have to challenge
things look sort of obvious if you think
about the history of intellectuals I
think you can show that it's quite
different uh actually the the term
intellectual came into use in its modern
sense pretty much with the dfus trial in
France late 19th century now today we
admire and resp respect the DFAS ards
and mola you know others who stood up
for for justice and so on you look back
at the time they were A persecuted
minority the great intellectuals you
know the Immortals of the French Academy
bitterly condemned and denounced them
how dare you challenge uh the uh August
character of the state you writer with
no competence how can you claim that our
army is deceiving us and so on and in
fact EML Zola had to flee from France
and that's pretty typical take almost
any society you like uh and you find
that there's a fringe of critical
dissidents and they're usually subjected
to one or another form of punishment
depends on the nature of the society so
if it was in Eastern Europe in the uh
last 50 years they could be jailed say
like VAV hav was into jail if it is in
our domains in Central America that have
their heads blown off we don't like to
think of that comparison but it's in
fact true uh the torture murder you know
atrocities and with our in our own
domain say Latin America was much worse
than what was going on in Eastern Europe
in the postalon era but in both cases
there's a harsh repression of people who
are critical of established power power
and that goes back as far as you like it
goes back to Classical Greece so who
drank the hemlock in Classical Greece uh
it was the person who was uh um
corrupting the Youth of Athens by asking
hard questions that you're not supposed
to ask Socrates take a look at the
biblical record at roughly the same
period you know it's a kind of oral
history but what's reconstructed from it
there were people who by our standards
could be called
intellectuals people
who condemned criticized the king and
his crimes who gave geopolitical
analysis and they warn warning that the
acts of the kings were going to lead to
disaster who called for U Mercy
compassion for widows and orphans and so
on now those are people who are called
the translation is prophets it's a kind
of a bad translation of an obscure
Hebrew word but in our terms they were
functioning roughly the way disident
intellectuals do how are they treated
they were imprisoned and driven into the
desert and
marginalized there were
intellectuals who were
respected uh flatterers at the court
centuries later they were called false
prophets but not at the time
and I think if you think through history
that pattern is replicated very
consistently let me let me give a quote
of yours to to to that I want you to
comment I have two quotes in that regard
I want to comment on before we actually
get to some of the specifics which I
want to get to you point out that no one
would be disturbed by an analysis of the
political behavior of Russians French or
tanzanians questioning their motives and
interpreting their actions in terms of
long-range interest perhaps wellc concen
concealed behind official rhetoric but
it's an article of faith that American
motives are pure and not subject to
analysis although it is nothing new in
American intellectual history or for
that matter in the general history of
imperialist apologia this innocence
becomes increasingly distasteful as the
power it serves grows more dominant in
the world affairs and more capable
therefore of the unconstrained
viciousness that the mass media present
to us each day
I I think that's a defensible statement
well I hope so said
it I think the point the point the point
and I remember this vividly and remember
that this statement is the conclusion
from you know extensive documentation
yeah and and substantiated and I have
many pages that I've been turning over
because we don't have time to to to read
your substantiations but I do remember
you're making the statement to me many
many years ago something that that
seemed obvious and that I guess if you
asked a 5-year-old I think is the way
you put it they'd give you the answer
but you never hear which is would you
expect that this country would behave
differently than any other country and
would you expect that foreign policy
wouldn't be wouldn't be carried out in
the interest of those who are most
powerful in that country instead of in
Terms of altruism but we grow up with
this illusion I didn't grow up in the
United States but but it was the same in
in Canada
the illusion that somehow this country
was somehow morally Superior to all
others yeah it's called American
exceptionalism uh the only Pro there a
couple of problems with that concept
that concept is held by every great
power yeah uh so there's British
exceptionalism French exceptionalism and
so on secondly it's not the
exceptionalism is wrong they're all the
same they're all the same now yeah in
fact I yeah well there's some great
things I'm going to skip but but I but I
want you to also come in on this quote
because this is in also in regard to
your view towards certain types of
intellectual activity in short the
experts on values spokesman for the
great religions and philosophical
systems will provide fundamental
insights on moral perspectives and the
experts on social theory will provide
General empirically validated
propositions and general quote unquote
General models of conflict from this
interplay new policies will emerge
presumably from application of the
Cannons of the scientific method the
only debatable issue it seems to me is
whether it's more ridiculous to turn to
experts in social theory for General
well-confirmed propositions or to the
specialists in the great religions and
philosophical systems for insights into
fundamental human values I think again
that that's
defensible so
so what do we do what we do is uh
recognized that people like us I suspect
virtually all of us are a privileged
minority MH we do have unusual Freedom
by comparative standards you know
there's plenty you can criticize about
the country but by comparative standards
it's very free uh the ability of the
state to repress and constrain is quite
limited for anybody who has a degree of
privilege now it's not true if you
happen to be a black kid in the slums
but uh for people like us you
know people who've gone through college
who are relatively well off you know
have the have the resources have the
time have the access to the internet
have plenty of
opportunities uh I think that uh yields
conclusions about what we ought to be
doing I mean quite generally uh
privilege confers
opportunity and
opportunity uh confers
responsibility and responsibility means
uh dedication to challenging
questioning uh uh the U varities that
are imposed on us by doctrinal systems
and uh structural Arrangements that uh
are based on hierarchy and domination
and working not only challenging them
but doing something about it uh and to
the degree that you have privilege
there's more that you can do I think
that's just as simple as that and again
I think a 5-year-old would understand it
well I told you we're in
[Music]
that we're definitely in the Applause
phase and it'll go on because I want it
seemed to me that um you you end one of
that that that that um
Essay with the statements about a
related to a a a Russian death camp pay
master um uh and when or a German Death
campaign master who who learned the
Russians would hang him and he said why
should they what have I done and he said
the qu and you said the question what
have I done is one that we may ask well
ask ourselves as we read each day a
fresh atrocities in Vietnam as we create
or mouth or tolerate the deceptions that
will be used to justify the next defense
of
Freedom so let's talk about some of
those deceptions which I think is one of
the I happen I would applaud because I
think that's one of the most important
have to remember by by uh but we we by
1966 when that was written uh one of the
leading Specialists on Vietnam the most
one of the most respected ones Bernard
fall French military historian Vietnam
specialist very highly respected what he
wrote at that time was that it is
questionable whether Vietnam as a
historic and cultural entity Will
Survive the attack of the most uh
powerful and brutal military machine of
all time namely us that was right at
that time so I think those words were
appropriate and if you ask what's
happened next it's repeated over and
over again we're going to go I want to
go one by one through some of them and
and and and and um but at the same time
before we get there I want to point out
you've written a lot about this fact
that there is a Machinery that makes it
extremely difficult to see what's
actually happening and that it's well
organized you've argued um and uh and
you and and you quote Edward bernes um
who um shortly before he was honored for
his contributions by the American
Psychological Association 1949 wrote the
conscious and intelligent manipul ation
of the organized habits and opinions of
the masses is an important element in a
Democratic Society went on um there's a
trifling fraction of the population who
understand the mental processes and
social patterns of the masses and are
therefore in a position to pull the
wires which control the public mind this
process of engineering consent is the
very essence of the democratic process
he put that's Edward ber and it's
important to remember who he was
he's one of the founders of the public
relations industry uh his uh first great
book was was called in the 1920s was
called propaganda in those days the term
propaganda was used for persuasion
basically it got a kind of bad
connotation during the 30s and the 40s
so we now only use it for the propaganda
of others not for our own but uh he was
the founder of the public relations
industry he's a very
respected Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy
liberal a hero in Cambridge uh where I
live uh his first great achievement what
really propelled him to fame was uh
getting women to smoke in the 1920s
women didn't smoke uh he was hired by
one of the forget which one one of the
tobacco companies and he U arranged
things like having U model walk down
Fifth Avenue and smoking and that's the
modern women that's liberating and so on
how many tens of millions of women he
killed we don't know but plenty of them
uh one of his other great achievements
in uh
1954 was to create uh in the country the
fear that unless we defend ourselves uh
from communism in Guatemala we're going
to be destroyed that laid the basis for
overthrowing Guatemalan democracy brief
experiment democracy imposing a vicious
brutal
dictatorship which pretty much lasts
till today destroying the country
hundreds of thousands of killed and so
on those are the achievements of uh
propaganda for which he he's respected
another point that should be made is
that what he was saying is pretty much
character characteristic of intellect
liberal intellectual opinion about the
nature of democracy let me go on from
that in fact here's a I don't know if
he's considered a liberal intellectual
hero the professor of Science of
government at Harvard uh Samuel
Huntington um who you quote The
Architects of power in the United States
must create a force that can be felt but
not seen power remains strong when it
remains in the dark exposed to the
sunlight light it begins to
evaporate and then he
said of the Reagan years that you have
to sell intervention and other or other
military action in such a way as to
create the misimpression that it is the
Soviet Union that you fighting so this
is discussed in the open that's
1981 and he should be respected for his
honesty but that's pretty much correct
in fact the other person that amazed me
that you often talk about should be
respected for his honesty is a is
another despicable human being Henry
Kissinger um and and uh and I wonder
whether you might want to comment on
that well um Kissinger has some really
remarkable lines and what's important
about them is not just that he produced
them and that they led to actions uh
implementing them but that there's no
reaction to it among the intellectual
classes so for example one and and one
point in must be
1971 uh he calmly transmitted orders
from probably half drunk Richard Nixon
uh to the uh US Army and Air Force uh
referring to Cambodia and the orders
were anything that flies against
anything that moves in rural Cambodia
it's pretty hard to find in the uh
archival record any statement advocating
genocide at that level of clarity and
explicitness and those orders were
carried out with horrendous effect now
all of this appeared in the New York
Times when the Nixon tapes were exposed
there was an article about what was in
them mostly about gossip but if you look
closely one of the things in the
revelation was this order there was no
reaction to it that's the part that's
significant that we ought to think about
well in fact that's not the first time I
think that you would argue that the
United States was involved in genocide
and in fact you quote um the you begin
and I want to sort of be I want to list
some of the things you've discussed and
maybe debate a few of them all the way
up to the issue that many people are
expecting us to talk about at some point
today uh which is in the Middle East um
you the operative you talk about the
nurmberg trials and you say the
operative definition of crime is crime
that you carried out but we did not to
to underscore the fact Nazi war
criminals were absolved if the defense
could show that their us counterparts
carried out the same crimes so therefore
massive bombing and destructions of
cities or or civilian populations is not
considered genocide because the United
States did it and in fact that was
explicit if you read say telr Taylor
Chief prosecutor he says well wouldn't
make sense to charge the Nazis with the
crime of uh bombing of heavy Urban
concentrations because we did it even
more than they did so how can it be a
crime you know in
fact and you have to recall that of all
the tribunals nurenberg is the most the
one that deserves most respect the
others are much worse but that was the
Criterion for war crimes at nurenberg if
they did it
and we didn't it's a war crime so you
want to list some of the major times
that we've been involved in genocide
perhaps from going from Florida
Nicaragua El Salvador maybe have some
just remind people especially the young
people in the audience well you know
again that's something all of us ought
to know why are we
here what happened to the indigenous
population are they
[Applause]
around I me
that that answers the question and in
fact the perpetrators were quite aware
of it if you read the founding fathers
you know General Henry knox's first uh
Secretary of War on and on they were
well aware that what they were doing was
Exterminating the indigenous
populations uh we're a settler colonial
society we're here because the
indigenous population isn't here okay
pick the word you like but that's a fact
fact a a parallel fact is that to an
extent that is only beginning to be
revealed by scholarship very recently uh
our wealth privilege uh progress is
based very heavily on a Century of
vicious slave labor camps where
productivity namely what are called
slave plantations where
productivity actually increased very
rapidly more rapidly than in
manufacturing without any technological
progress other than more intensive use
of the bull whip and the pistol That's
the basis for our wealth uh that's uh
you know cotton production was set off
the Industrial Revolution and it wasn't
didn't just enrich the plant the slave
owners it it created the manufacturing
economy in the Northeast you know Mills
were the big innovation in manufacturer
created the modern Financial system same
in England that's how the uh the English
Industrial Revolution took off so based
on horrendous slave labor which in fact
was replicated in later years and
extermination of the indigenous
population these are pretty serious
things well it seems to me they're
serious but what's more obscene
fine
um what what's more of seen and I think
you've argued this because I've learned
it from you is the is not is not the act
of doing it is the fact that we forget
about it the fact that we don't talk
about
it and
um the fact that we don't talk about
Nicaragua as you put it was reduced to a
second poorest country in the hemisphere
with 60% of children under two Afflicted
with anemia and severe malnutrition and
if it was comparable to our country it
would have been been about 2.5 million
dead individuals if you if you ramped up
to our country the fact that that that
in El Salvador people didn't talk about
the the brutal murders of the of the of
in in that case the the Catholic uh uh J
priest jesuis priests the leading
leading Latin American intellectuals and
that those deaths weren't talked about
it if if the responsibility of
intellectuals is to expose lies and
Truth we need to keep talking about it
exactly it goes on now in that regard
let's I mean take uh oh let's come to
today yeah I was going to say let's come
to today I mean
we're deeply concerned about the rise of
U uh the so-called Islamic State which
is a monstrous development no doubt
about it where did it come from was it
there 20 years ago I mean it was largely
created by our hitting a vulnerable
society with a
sledgehammer imposing namely the
invasion of Iraq imposing sectarian
divisions that barely existed uh
horrible atrocities out of this came
extreme violence sectarian conflict
tearing Iraq to shreds spreading
throughout the region and an extremist
Fringe of this is now taking over a good
bit of Iraq and Syria
and we were puzzled about how to deal
with it it didn't come from nowhere you
know actions have consequences actions
have
con that told keep going but but I want
to act actions have consequences and in
fact there was a big issue there wasn't
there seemed to be very little debate
about whether our forget the invasion of
Iraq but our invasion of Afghanistan was
a just war and and um and you put it in
an interesting way I think which which
puts it in perspective because it's um
the questions of just War at once the
issue of universality arises if the US
is unquestionably authorized to bomb
another country to compel its leaders to
turn over someone its suspects of
involvement in a terrorist act then a
fortiori Cuba Nicaragua and a host of
others are entitled to bomb the us
because there's no doubt of its
involvement in serious activities
against them and
uh I mean it's kind of suppressed
because now there's a story that uh we
invaded Afghanistan to overthrow the
Taliban bring freedom and democracy and
so on but go back to what actually
happened it's not ancient history you
don't have to go to secret records it's
all public uh the bomb the initial
bombing of
Afghanistan was announced by president
presid Bush as uh punishment to for the
the Taliban for refusing to turn over to
us someone who we suspected of terrorism
now actually they had made they
requested
evidence uh no we that's you don't we
don't deal with people like you by
presenting evidence we tell you turn
them over turn them over they actually
made some gestures we don't know how
serious they were
uh to set up extradition proceedings uh
independent trials and so on we don't
want to hear anything about that we
ordered you to turn them over you don't
do it we bomb you period that's that's
what happened October 7th look it up
okay I want to I want to I was going to
talk about terrorism but we're running
short of time in fact we've gone over
but that's okay um uh there are two
issues that want to talk about the first
one is Netanyahu what the hell's going
on
well uh actually a number of my Israel
Friends The Fringe of the dissident
Community there people like airas gidon
Ley and others are actually
uh praising the election of Netanyahu
says it it takes the veil away from the
common policies and there's some truth
to that I think but there more to it we
should look a little bit about the
history that Netanyahu is now being
attacked in the United States because in
a campaign speech he said there won't be
a Palestinian state in my lifetime well
in
2009 his party leud the governing party
had an electoral program official
program what did it say it said there
cannot be any
self-determination for Palestinians in
the land of Israel that means Jordan to
the Sea the same comment in fact go back
to
1996 uh netanyahu's first electoral
Victory he was elected prime minister in
1996 the preceding prime minister Shimon
Perez left office announcing publicly
there will never be a Palestinian State
when Netanyahu came in his minister of
information was asked will your
government tolerate a Palestinian State
the answer is worth reading he said look
we're going to leave certain areas that
we don't want for the Palestinians they
can stay there and if they want to call
it a state it's okay or they can call it
fried
chicken that's the attitude towards
Palestinian rights and incidentally
that's pretty much across the board it's
uh uh
netanyahu's does it in a manner that may
be kind of rude and offensive but the
attitudes of of the rest the mainstream
Spectrum are not that different and it
happens because we're supporting it
that's exactly the problem is right
here it's uh there
there's there may be more questions
Israel so I'm going to leave that but I
think
um I was surprised by a statement you
made in 2004 about Syria you were about
Syria actually you you argued in fact
that it was really inappropriate to have
Syria on the list of of States
sponsoring terrorism that we shouldn't
have them that they were an ally um and
that um uh and it hadn't been implicated
in sponsoring terrorism for many years
been highly uh cooperative and providing
Intelligence on on radical Islamic
groups has your view changed well Syria
has prettyy is pretty much
self-destructed since then so sure it's
not it's no longer an ally providing
information about the Jihadi ter
terrorism what's happened in Syria is a
a horrendous development in which the
society is just collapsing into total
catastrophe may never
recover okay look I want to because we
I'm sure there'll be lots of questions
about about Foreign Affairs I want end
with a few with the with the thoughts of
the future and also a subject that I
can't help bring up given your writing
um George Bush reportedly proclaimed
that God told me to strike at Al-Qaeda
and I struck them and then he instructed
me to strike at Saddam which I did and
then he wrote and then and now I am
determined to solve the problem of the
Middle East he said also and then your
words also at the command of the Lord of
hosts the war god whom we are instructed
by the holy book to worship above all
other gods and as I mentioned the elite
press dutifully refers to his Messianic
mission to solve the problem of the
Middle East in fact the world following
quote our responsibility to history to
rid the world of
evil the early English colonists North
America were following the word of the
Lord as they slaughtered the
am amalekites forgive me in the new
Israel that they were liberating
liberating from the Native blight those
who followed them also by waving god-
freeing Christians did their religious
Duty by conquering and possessing the
promised land ridding it of millions of
Canaanites and proceeding to war against
the papists in Florida Mexico and
California
now sustainable again I'm afraid yes but
but the question I'm going to ask you
may not be the one you think um
so you once told me in an email when I
weal when I talked about my concerns
about religious um
religion um
uh that it's that you rightly then this
is a profoundly important thing you
don't care what people believe it's what
they do that counts but beliefs
influence
actions and it seems to me and I want I
like hear your comment that if you
really talk about if we go back to your
argument for the responsibility of in
intellectuals which is exposed lies is
it not therefore our responsibility to
expose religious lies
we
can we can
uh I mean uh if say uh a third of the
American population believes that the
world was created a couple of thousand
years ago exactly as it is
today yes it is our responsibility to
expose that lie and to tell the truth on
the other hand if uh say I'm thinking of
a particular person but could give many
examples if a a Peruvian peasant who
immigrated to the United States 30 years
ago and has managed to create a decent
life for herself under pretty awful
conditions uh is an Evangelical
Christian who has a prayer group every
evening that goes to visit the sick and
pray with them I'm not going to read her
a lesson in
epistemology okay
I I I I I couldn't agree with you more
it's our it's our it's our duty to
expose Lies when they influence behavior
and and especially State behavior in a
bad way and I think the although you
didn't intend it all those quotes of
course and most many wars are
justified by by religious arguments
although one could argue if there wasn't
God one would justify them but we should
also remember that there's a secular
religion which is even more devastating
and that's things like the concept of
American exceptionalism that's a secular
religion it's now to to conclude to get
to the to get to the end before so we
give people a chance to go to the
bathroom um us among others
um there's an urgency that you ended in
a recent uh uh piece you wrote just last
year and two pieces that basically Begin
by saying there's nothing particularly
novel about any of this apart from one
aspect the means of Destruction that
have now been developed are by now so
awesome and the risks of deploying and
using them so enormous that a rational
Martian Observer would not rank the
prospects for survival of this curious
curious species very high as long as
contempt for elementary moral truisms
remain so deeply entrenched among
educated Elites and you talked about and
and you began to talk about the issue of
climate change about climate change and
our future human in in a piece called
human intelligence in the environment
and you pointed out an interesting
debate between Carl Sean and Ernst Meyer
about whether we'd find life elsewhere
in the universe which is an issue
elsewhere in the universe which is an
issue that's closer to my own
activities and Meyer pointed out that
the great americ Great American
biologist if you to know absolutely that
if you think about the longevity of
species the smaller of the species the
ones that can reproduce more more
quickly are the more robust and as you
become larger and larger the mammals
essentially are less less robust and
that if you think of Life as a lethal
mutation not life intelligence
intelligent life as a lethal mutation
that he argued you wouldn't expect it
it's been around for about 100,000 years
and you wouldn't expect it to survive
much
longer
it he says that the average life of
species is roughly 100 yeah they're
roughly one one yeah one one
extermination of a species ex we just
had a meeting on extinctions and we
quoted that data on this stage once
every 100,000 years so so we argued that
in fact um humans have this potential to
exterminate ourselves and and you're
particularly interested worried about
the fact that climate
change is a severe issue but you don't
see you see again the same kind of
effort to obfuscate the issue by
American power Elites for climate change
that you saw for American Military
intervention so I I wanted to ask you to
to comment on that a little bit well we
uh you know anyone who isn't living
under a rock knows that we're heading
for a
precipice the U uh human effect on the
environment climate change anthropogenic
climate change is enormous and
it's the effect is uh already being felt
and it will be if it continues the way
it's going it'll be very severe year in
a short period of time maybe our
grandchildren so what are we doing well
for example open any page business page
in the newspapers uh Euphoria about uh a
hundred years of energy independent
about the great new uh production
techniques that are increasing the use
of fossil fuels about how the uh energy
corporations are there happens to be a
slight oil glut at the moment but the
energy corporations are poised so that
if the oil uh if the glut declines
they'll be able quickly to move with new
technology into producing more and more
fossil fuels that is driving us toward
the precipice it will be the Saudi
Arabia of the 21st century meanwhile
destroying the prospects for the the
lives of our grandchildren um almost any
issue of a newspaper paper or a journal
has articles like that and but you argue
that that's an imperative of capitalism
in some sense that that the idea to of
to consider externalities that
economists consider the flow of money
but not in in but not the other impacts
on human life and they those aspects are
not included in costs and in some sense
you argue that I think that that's an
inevitable consequence of what you call
the real existing capitalist democracy
and um and um and there's two quotes I
want to end with you say within the real
existing capitalist democracy which you
call wrecked recd wrecked um it is of
extreme importance that we become the
stupid Nation not misled by science and
rationality in the interest of the
short-term gains of the master of the
economy and political system damn the
consequences the then the last statement
which I think takes us back to the very
beginning which is I want to end with
with it is this question of human nature
is this an inevitable consequence of
human nature you say there is something
about us our intelligence that we're
capable of acting in ways that are
rational within a narrow framework but
are are irrational in terms of other
long-term goals do you see any optimism
well I think there that we have to make
a distinction here between individual
rationality and institutional
rationality
uh individual stupidity and
institutional stupidity uh so for
example recently at Davos when you were
there there was a poll of uh
CEOs when they were asked to rank risks
I think they had 19 risks that they
thought were serious climate change was
not among them the top risk was
regulation the one possibility of
eliminating the disaster now that's
instit institutional stupidity if you at
if you would ask those individuals what
do you think about climate change they'd
probably say I'm contributing to the
cigara club as individuals they may be
perfectly rational and sensible but in
their institutional role they have there
are certain requirements that they must
meet if you're the CEO of say Exxon
Mobile and you're not trying to maximize
the use of fossil fuels you're out and
somebody else is in because that's the
nature of the institution in these kind
of Quasi Market systems in which we live
uh
transactions ignore externalities like
if I sell you a car we make a deal for
ourselves we don't care about the effect
on them and there's an effect more
pollution more traffic gems and so on
and it adds up in the case of extraction
of fossil fuels the extern Al ity
happens to be survival of your
grandchildren but in the institutional
framework that's not considered that's a
footnote like in an economics text okay
but that's institutional
irrationality uh individual rationality
is different which means that we as
individuals have the capacity to modify
and overcome the institutions that are
driving us to disaster that's the
element of Hope in fact the element of
hope it seems to me to to summarize and
I want to see if you agree with this
that speaking truth to power which was
what drove you into the public domain at
a time when the US was committing
atrocities in another country in a
global sense now by this very statement
what you I repeat again it's extremely
important that we become the stupid
Nation not misled by science and
rationality that the motivate that the
the impetus the the imperative for
intellectuals especially scientists
right now is to reach out with the
science to combat the great greatest
threat facing Humanity at the present
time for those who have the technical
scientific knowledge there's a very high
imperative but the same is true for the
rest of us you don't have to be a
climate scientist to understand this
much about what's going on and if you
care about whether your grandchildren
other grandchildren have a decent chance
to survival for survival then these are
really great imperatives the same is
true of nuclear weapons I mean if you
look over the record of the last 70
years it's kind of a miracle that we're
still here it's just amazing
unbelievable when you look at the
accidents the near accidents the you
know the and there's still 10,000
nuclear weapons many on a hair trigger
they're being modernized they're being
modernized for no strategic purpose
whatsoever except for increasing the
possibility of Destruction but that I
want to I want to I want to say that
because I think that that's the
motivation I will repeat again for why
we're doing what we're doing here today
reaching out to the public and the
internet today and to you today with
these issues because it seems to me the
only hope we can do is to reach out and
and do the responsibility of
intellectuals and we've gone for a half
an hour longer than I planned but if
there's anyone in the world that worth
that extra half an hour it's no chsky
thank you very much
[Applause]
we'll be back answer your questions and
20 minutes
[Applause]
