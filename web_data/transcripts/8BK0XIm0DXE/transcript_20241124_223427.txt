ladies and gentlemen Noam
chsky
and
okay thank
[Music]
you perhaps it's uh sign of my age or
perhaps something else but uh I can't uh
I cannot help thinking more and more
about what kind of a world we're leaving
for our children
grandchildren and it's not a very pretty
picture not one that should Inspire
Pride there are quite a few Grim Shadows
that hover menac inly uh over uh
thoughts about our Legacy and of all of
them two are dominant because they
literally threaten survival of the
species at least in any decent form one
is nuclear war the other is
environmental disaster and not only is
nothing serious being done about these
challenges but current decisions are
enhancing the
threats uh it should be unnecessary to T
on environmental disasters and how the
impending crisis is being handled uh as
for the threat of nuclear war it's on
the front pages daily but in a way that
would
seem outlandish to an independent
Observer viewing the uh strange doings
on Earth in fact this same independent
Observer might wonder if we are trying
to settle uh debate that took place some
years ago between two eminent scientists
uh Carl Sean
astrophysicist Ernst Meyer
biologist they were debating uh the
probability of uh intelligent
extraterrestrial life and Sean uh
arguing from the point of view of an
astrophysicist uh concluded that it's
very likely because there are so many
planets similar enough to Earth so that
uh they could sustain life and hence
Evolution to higher
intelligence uh erns mayor took the
opposite view arguing as a biologist he
said that we should pay attention
mention to the one example we have
namely Earth and he pointed out that uh
in the history of life on Earth there
have been several billion
species uh some successful some not and
uh turns out that the the success of a
species uh as determined by the number
of uh uh the number of instances of it
that surviv
uh is inversely related to intelligence
so the most most successful species are
those that mutate very quickly like
bacteria or those that have a fixed
ecological niche like Beatles they do
very well no matter what happens and as
you move up the scale of what we call
intelligence survival becomes much more
hazard is among
mammals there are actually very few of
them uh and uh there are a lot of cows
but that's only because humans
domesticate them just as they're a lot
of chickens for the same reason but
Survival on their own is they don't do
very well when you get to primates there
are very few uh
humans uh have been very sparsely have
been very sparse throughout the world
until very recently so recent that uh
doesn't mean anything in evolutionary
terms uh he also pointed out that the
average
life uh expectancy for a species is
roughly 100,000 years rather ominously
that's about how long it's been that
homo sapiens has been on Earth so his
conclusion is uh that uh intelligence is
basically a lethal mutation
uh as you move up to Greater
intelligence there's more and more
self-destruction and it you could this
extraterrestrial Observer might argue
that we're trying to prove that uh Meer
was correct certainly what it looks like
well turning to nuclear threats the
current nuclear threat not for the first
time is in the Middle East in this case
it focuses on Iran uh the general
picture in the west is clear and
straightforward uh it is far too
dangerous to allow Iran to reach n
what's called nuclear
capability that is the ability to create
nuclear weapons if they decide to do to
to do so that capability is enjoyed by a
great many countries in the world as to
whether they have decided us
intelligence says it doesn't
know uh the international atomic energy
agency says pretty much the same thing
in their latest report just a few weeks
ago the agency concludes all quote that
it cannot demonstrate the absence of
Undeclared nuclear material in
activities in
Iran can't prove that they're not taking
place that's a condition that can't be
satisfied maybe
conveniently therefore Iran must be
denied the right to enrich uranium
that's guaranteed by the
nonproliferation treaty uh which in fact
Iran has signed unlike three nuclear
Powers uh India Pakistan and Israel uh
that's the general picture in the west I
have to emphasize West not the rest of
the world the non-aligned movement which
is the majority of people of the world
and states of the World by far has taken
a rather different St you as you know
I'm sure it has recently met in Taran
regular meeting and it came out with a
vigorous endorsement of Iran's right to
enrich uh uranium as guaranteed by the
nonproliferation treaty that's not a new
position they've been taking that
position for a long time also quite
interesting is the Arab world I'll come
back to that in a
moment well the basic reason for the
concern has been expressed succinctly by
General an American General General Lee
Butler is's the former head of the US
strategic command which is in charge of
nuclear weapons strategic poliy policies
involving nuclear weapons he writes that
it is dangerous in the extreme that in
The Cauldron of animosities that we call
the Middle East One Nation should arm
itself with nuclear weapons which may
Inspire other nations to do
so General Butler however was not
referring to Iran he was referring to
Israel that's the country that ranks
highest in polls of European public
opinion as the most dangerous country in
the world right above Iran and not in
the Arab world in the Arab world the
public regards the United States as the
second most dangerous country after
Israel That's goes back quite a while
Iran is generally disliked but it
doesn't it ranks far lower as a threat
among populations that is not the
dictatorships uh Western media and
commentary keep almost entirely to the
views of the dictators so we constantly
hear that the Arabs want decisive uh Us
action against Iran which is true of the
dictators you may recall that a little
while ago
Wikileaks uh
released uh
uh diplomatic
documents
quoting Arab
dictators Saudi Arabia and the Emirates
as calling for strong Us action against
Iran and the commentary about that was
interesting it was almost euphoric uh
isn't this wonderful the Arabs support
uh uh US policy against Iran which is
true of the Arab dictators at the very
same time Western polls were coming out
Western run polls showing that it's
quite the opposite that uh U though
again they don't like Iran uh they're
not regarded as a threat the United
States is regarded as a threat and in
fact opposition to US policy was so
strong that uh a majority in some
countries like Egypt a substantial
majority thought that the region would
be more secure if Iran had nuclear
weapons they don't want Iran to have
nuclear weapons but if the United States
and Israel are have them and are there
that's what's needed uh that that was
almost never mentioned and that reaction
is pretty striking it illustrates the uh
contempt for democracy among Western in
Western Elite opinion doesn't matter
what the population thinks
that's derided as the Arab Street who
cares what they think what matters is
what the dictators think it's a
commentary about us not about the Arab
world well unlike
Iran uh Israel refuses to allow
inspections refuses to join the
nonproliferation treaty it has hundreds
of nuclear weapons and advanced Delivery
Systems uh also has a long record record
of violence and repression it has
annexed and settled conquered
territories illegally in violation of
Security Council orders World Court
decisions many acts of aggression
invaded 11 and five times with no
credible pretext and much
more uh the uh meanwhile uh severe
threats of attack uh continue
uh from the United States and
particularly Israel da there are strong
threats of attack uh and there's a
reaction from the US government the
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta
reacted to threats from Israel by saying
we don't want them to attack Iran but uh
there are sovereign country and they can
do what they like I mean if Iran was
making comparable threats about Israel
and it isn't the reaction would be quite
different uh if some of you have uh
antiquarian interests you may remember
that there's a document called the
United Nations
Charter uh the key provision in the UN
Charter is a ban against the threat or
use of force in international
Affairs uh there are two Rogue
States uh United States and Israel that
pay no attention to this and are
constantly issuing severe threats and
the European Union goes along
politely uh and the threats are not just
words there is an ongoing war or at
least what we would regard regard as an
ongoing War if it was directed against
us there are regular assassinations of
uh scientists terrorist acts there's a
very severe economic War uh us threats
which are unilateral have cut Iran out
of the International Financial system
the European countries don't disobey the
United States so they've gone along uh
five uh uh highlevel former NATO
commanders recently released what they
called a new grand strategy which uh I
identified various acts of war that
justify a violent response one of them
is weapons of
Finance that's an active war that
justifies a military reaction when it's
directed against us but cutting Iran out
of global financial markets is
different uh cyber the US government is
very proudly announcing that it's
undertaking extensive cyber warfare
against uh against Iran the Pentagon has
identified cyber warfare as a serious
military attack which justifies our
military response uh but that's
uh that's the difference between what we
do to them and what they do to us uh
Israel has an enormous lethal Armory not
just nuclear uh only recently in the
last few months uh Israel has received
Advanced submarines provided by Germany
uh these are capable of carrying
Israel's nuclear tipped missiles and
they're sure to be deplo deployed in the
Persian Gulf or nearby they may already
be there uh certainly if Israel proceeds
with its plan to bomb Iran and the US of
course has a vast array of nuclear their
weapons surrounding the region from the
Indian Ocean all the way to the West uh
in the Persian Gulf itself the US has
enough Firepower to destroy the world
many times over another story that's in
the news right now is the Israeli
bombing of the Iraqi reactor osirak in
1981 and that's being presented as a a
model for Israeli bombing of Iran it's
rarely pointed out that that bombing did
not end Iraq's nuclear weapons program
it initiated it we know that even from
us intelligence they didn't have Saddam
Hussein didn't have a nuclear weapons
program but after the bombing he made
sure to develop one that was the effect
of the 1981 bombing uh if Iran is bombed
it's almost certain to proceed
just as Saddam Hussein did after the
osirak bombing and uh it's not a
pleasant Prospect well in a few weeks uh
we will be commemorating the 50th
anniversary of the most dangerous moment
in human history I'm quoting the words
of uh American historian Kennedy advisor
Arthur Schlesinger is referring of
course to the October
1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis uh I doubt that the commemoration
will be presenting it accurately but you
should bear in mind what happened then
Kennedy raised the nuclear alert to the
second highest
level just short of launch uh he
authorized NATO NATO aircraft with
Turkish or other Pilots to take off fly
to Moscow drop bombs which would set off
a nuclear configration
uh at the peak of the Missile Crisis
Kennedy himself estimated the probab
probability of nuclear war at perhaps
50% that would have been a war that uh
would destroy the Northern Hemisphere
President Eisenhower had warned and
facing that risk Kennedy refused to
agree publicly to an offer from Russian
Prime Minister KF to end the crisis by
simultaneous withdrawal of Russian
missiles from Cuba and US missiles from
Turkey these were obsolete missiles a
withdrawal order had already been issued
to get rid of them because they were
being replaced by
invulnerable Polaris submarines
nevertheless Kennedy refused to accept
the offer it was felt necessary to
firmly establish the principle that
Russia has no right to have offensive
weapons anywhere beyond the borders of
the
USSR while the US must retain the right
to have them anywhere want all over the
world targeting Russia or for that
matter targeting China
uh in in fact at that time
1962 the United States had uh just
secretly deployed nuclear missiles in
okwa theoretically a Japanese island but
the US took it over after the second
world war as a military base against the
uh strong and continuing protest of the
people of Okinawa that those missiles
were aimed at China at a moment of
serious Regional tensions that's just
recently been learned well fortunately
HF backed down but the world can't be
assured of such sanity
forever uh particularly threatening is
the fact that intellectual opinion and
even scholarship a haale Kennedy's
achievement as his finest hour I think
that uh requires are some serious
reflection uh inability to face the
truth about oneself is all too common a
feature of the intellectual culture and
it has ominous
implications well that was
1962 10 years later during the
19773 Israel Arab War the Henry
Kissinger called a highlevel nuclear
alert the purpose was to warn the
Russians to keep hands off uh while he
was secretly informing Israel that they
were authorized to violate the ceasefire
imposed by the US and Russia documents
that have only recently been
released uh pretty serious in fact
though reporting of course uh when
Ronald Reagan came into office a few
years later the United States launched
operations probing Russian defenses and
simulating air and Naval attacks also
placing persing missiles in Germany with
a five minute flight time to Russian
targets that provided what the CIA
called a super sudden First Strike
capability the Russians were naturally
deeply concerned they didn't know if
these Pro prob
efforts probing entering Russian
airspace to probe defenses and so on and
the simulation of AA Naval attacks they
didn't know whether they were tests or
whether they were
real they were concerned that led to a
major war scare in
1983 we came very close uh there have
been hundreds of cases when human
intervention aborted a first nuclear
strike just minutes before launch that
was when automated systems gave false
alarms as they regularly do that's on
the US side we don't have records from
Russia but there's no doubt that their
systems are far more accident prone and
the same would be true of any other
nuclear power in fact it's a near
miracle that nuclear war has so far been
avoided and we are escalating the threat
meanwhile India and pakist an have come
close to nuclear war several times and
the crisis remain mainly over
Kashmir uh both countries have refused
to sign the nonproliferation treaty
along with Israel and along with Israel
they've received us support for
development of their nuclear weapons
program that's going on right now last
few years in the case of India uh since
it became a
uh
usli uh today the war threats of the
Middle East once again escalate these
dangers is there a way to deal with them
yeah there's a very straightforward way
to mitigate or probably end whatever
threat Iran is alleged to pose namely
move towards establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East uh
that has enormous international support
it's been called for repeatedly by the
UN Security Council uh the uh uh there
are actually two countries that have a
very special commitment to pursue this
the United States and Britain the reason
is that when the US and Britain invaded
Iraq 10 years ago they tried to provide
a thin legal cover for the invasion
uh as you recall they claimed that uh
Iraq had uh weapons for had had programs
to develop nuclear weapons and they
appealed to a UN resolution Security
Council resolution the resolution 687 in
uh
1991 which uh compelled Iraq to stop its
programs of nuclear weapons development
that was the pretext for the War uh we
know what happened to the pretext but
much less discussed in fact not
discussed is that same resolution
687 that calls on all states to move uh
to create a nuclear weapon free zone in
the Middle East so the US and Brit
Britain have a specific uh commitment to
this the latest major UN resolution on
Irani and nuclear weapons also calls
strongly for these moves there's
overwhelming international support
including even uh a majority of the
population in Israel so far it's been
blocked by the United States which
insists that Israel must be excluded
There's an opportunity coming again this
December when an International
Conference is scheduled under un aaces
on U
on moving towards uh nuclear weapons
free zone unless there's a very large
scale public pressure it's quite
unlikely that anything will be done but
very few people are even aware of this
press doesn't cover it in the United
States at least the matters virtually
never discussed I can't be that
confident about Europe but I've never
seen anything in the west generally
except for specialist journals if you
read specialist journals on arms control
they report it but very few people read
that well let's put these prospects
aside Grim prospects and turn to how the
current world system developed since
World War II how it's changed over the
years and where things stand
today there's a very common theme I'm
actually quoting from the US Academy of
political science a common theme that uh
only a few years ago America was hailed
to stride the world as a Colossus with
unparalleled power and unmatched appeal
but it is now in Decline omous ominously
facing the prospect of its final
Decay uh the major establishment journal
in the Journal of inter international
relations in the United States foreign
affairs Journal of the Council on
Foreign Relations had an issue a few
months ago where the front cover and big
bold letters featured the title of the
issue the title was is America
over uh these themes are very widely
believed and with some reason though
some essential qualifications are in
order I think uh the decline is real but
it's not recent in fact it's been
preceding since World War II that's when
us power reached its highest point it's
been declining steadily since uh there's
a corollary that's commonly drawn namely
that power will shift to China and India
it's highly dubious I think they're very
poor countries very severe internal
problems don't have time to to go into
it can if you like the world is surely
becoming more diverse but despite
America's continued decline uh in the
foreseeable future there's no competitor
for Global hegemonic power just to keep
to one dimension military power the US
military spending is almost the same as
the rest of the world combined and the
US is technologically far more advanced
of the US is alone in having military
bases elsewhere roughly a th000 military
bases riging the whole world uh recently
uh Figures were announced on global arm
sales uh the United States holds 3/4 of
the global market sales are more than 10
times as high as uh Second Place Russia
and the military Dimension is only one
of
many so the decline is real but the
power remains overwhelming well going
back to the beginnings of the
Contemporary era during World War II the
US
planners President Roosevelt's planners
recognized that the United States would
emerge from the war in a position of
overwhelming power in fact it's very
clear from the documentary record that
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the post-war World um
quoting the assessment
of distinguished British diplomatic
historian Jeffrey Warner he's one of the
most respected Specialists on the topic
and on the documentary evidence and what
he says is quite quite well
supported plans were developed during
during the war during the second World
War to control what was called what the
planners called a grand
area the grand area was to include as a
minimum the entire Western hemisphere of
course the Far East and the former
British Empire which the US would take
over uh in particular The crucial Middle
East oil reserves and also as much of
Eurasia as possible at the very least
its core industrial region in Western
Europe and in the southern European
States Italy and Greece Italy and Greece
and the planning of the time were
regarded as essential for ensuring
control of Middle East energy resources
which pass through the
Mediterranean and Within These expansive
domains uh the documents read the United
States was to maintain unquestioned
power with military and economic
Supremacy while ensuring the limitation
of any exercise of sovereignty by states
that might interfere with these Global
designs these doctrines still Prevail
though the capacity to implement them
has sharply declined actually we know
quite a lot about us internal planning
the reason is that the United States is
an unusually free Society maybe unique
uh we have enormous access to internal
records a kind of
a side complimentary comment is that the
population is uh saved from knowing
anything about this because surely the
media but even most scholarship just
ignore it except for highly specialized
scholarship uh these uh wartime plans
were not at all all
unrealistic for a long time the United
States had been Far and Away the richest
country in the world had unparalleled
advantages and in fact still is the
wartime there was huge government
stimulus during the war time during the
war that ended the depression and in
fact us industrial
capacity nearly quadrupled during the
second world war and meanwhile rival
industrial Powers were
decimated at the end of the war the
United States literally had half the
world's wealth and unmatched security
there's never been a situation of global
dominance anywhere near like that uh
there was a cold war that followed if
you take a look at the actual events of
the Cold War they consisted very largely
of efforts by the two superpowers to
enforce order in their own domains for
the Soviet Union it was Eastern Europe
the traditional Invasion Corridor into
Russia uh for the United States it was
most of the world well that was
1945 uh very quickly the grand area
began to erode the first blow and a very
serious one was in 1949 n it's there's a
phrase to describe it the routine phrase
describing it is the loss of China uh
China be moved towards
independence that had very severe
domestic repercussions in the United
States one of the factors that led to
what's called
McCarthyism many accusations about who's
to blame for the loss of
China that phrase the loss of China is
in interesting one can only lose what
one possesses like I can lose my
computer I can't lose your computer and
it's taken for granted that the United
States owns most of the World by right
so therefore If part of it becomes
independent we've lost it and the
question is who's to blame for this loss
well shortly after U southeast Asia
began to fall out of
control uh leading to concern about
further losses and by
1950 the US had launched sporting France
and on its own what became Washington's
horrendous Indo China Wars and also
going on another case was the huge
massacres in Indonesia in
1965 as us dominance was restored and
many other cases meanwhile subversion uh
massive violence continued elsewhere in
the effort to maintain what's called
stability meaning Conformity to us
demands uh Italy was not
overlooked uh 1948 as I'm sure you know
the United States intervened massively
to try to ensure that it would maintain
control of the political process in
Italy and in subsequent years uh Italy
was the scene of more CIA cover activity
than any other country at least until
the 1970s that's when the record runs
dry uh nevertheless decline was
inevitable the industrial World
reconstituted
reconstructed uh
decolonization proceeded pursuing
agonizing course by
1970 the US share of world wealth had
declined to about
25% that's still colossal but much less
than 50% it's approximately what it
still is at that point the industrial
world was becoming what's called
tripolar three major centers the United
States Europe and Asia Asia was then
Japan centered already becoming the
world's most dynamic uh industrial
region well 20 years later
Soviet Union collapsed and for those who
want to understand the reality of the
Cold War it's highly informative to look
into what happened when it ended it's
very natural place to look that was the
time of the first Bush Administration
the Civilized Bush uh it was then in
office uh the Bush Administration
immediately declared officially that
policies would rebain
pretty much unchanged but with different
pretexts so the huge military
establishment would be maintained but
not for defense against the Russians
rather to confront what they called the
technological sophistication of third
world
powers well educated intellectuals don't
laugh when they read that uh similarly
it would be necessary to Main maintain
what was called the defense industrial
base it's actually a euphemism for
advanced industry which is highly
reliant on government subsidy and
initiative that's contrary to free
market delusions uh what about
intervention forces well they still had
to be aimed at the Middle East where the
serious problems could not be laid at
the kremlin's door it's the official
wording notice that that quietly
withdraws a half a century of Deceit
when it was claimed that the threat was
the Russians it was no longer possible
to claim that so it was conceded that
the problems had always been what's
called radical nationalism that is
attempts by countries to pursue an
independent course in violation of grand
area principles analogous to Russian
actions in their much more restricted
domain interventions in Hungary
Czechoslovakia and Poland for the US
almost the whole world well the
principles were retained they were not
modified in fact the Clinton
Administration declared quote its
official comment State position declared
that the United States has the right to
use military force
unilaterally to ensure uninhibited
access access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources and
must have military forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
shape people's opinions about us and not
by gentle persuasion and to shape events
that will affect our livelihood and our
security I'm quoting official documents
of the Clinton era incidentally that
goes beyond anything claimed by his
successor George W bush
Bush's proclamations aroused enormous
anger and concern that Clinton's much
more extreme ones were ignored because
they were kind of presented politely and
quietly not arrogantly but the doctrines
themselves were actually worse uh one
very instructive case is Nao according
to standard Doctrine the NATO was
established to defend Europe defended
against the Russian hordes well after
1989 no more Russian hordes so therefore
if you believe the official Doctrine uh
NATO should have been reduced or
eliminated on the contrary the NATO was
expanded to the east immediately in
violation uh of verbal pledge to Mel
Gorbachev when he agreed he did agree to
allow a unified Germany to join NATO
that's an amazing concession on his part
in the light of history but there was a
quid quo he received a guarantee from
President Bush and his secretary of
state James Baker that NATO would not
move one inch to the east that was the
phrase meaning to East Germany or
certainly not beyond that was
immediately violated that Gorbachev was
naturally pretty upset but when he
complained uh the US government uh
informed him that it had only been a
verbal agreement nothing on paper and if
he's naive enough to accept the uh
Promises of an American Administration
that's his
problem the the uh by now NATO has
become a global intervention Force under
us command it has an official task
namely controlling the International
Energy System sea lanes and pipelines
and in fact whatever else the hegemonic
power
determines there was a period of e
Euphoria after the collapse of the
superpower enemy excited tales about the
end of History history uh the
possibility At Last of carrying out
humanitarian
intervention the idealistic New World
bent on ending in humanity can uh
proceed Guided by altruism and
principles and
values that's just a small sample of uh
the inspired rhetoric of prominent
European and American intellectuals it's
the 199 9 s and not everyone was so
enraptured the traditional victims the
global South bitterly condemned what
they called the so-called right of
humanitarian Intervention which they
recognized just to be the old right of
Imperial domination but as usual they
were
ignored uh after Bush number two took
over increasingly hostile World opinion
could
scarcely be ignored particularly in the
Arab world Bush's approval ratings
plummeted uh one of President Obama's
most impressive Feats is that he
succeeded in becoming even more
unpopular than Bush his popularity is
down to 5% in Egypt not much higher
elsewhere in the region considering the
reaction to Bush that's not a small
accomplishment
well meanwhile decline continued uh in
the past decade South America has been
lost that's serious enough but far more
serious would be moves towards
independence in the Middle East planners
of the
1940s recognized that control of the
incomparable energy reserves of the
Middle East would yield substantial
control of the world it's the words of
the influential Roosevelt advisor AA
Burley uh and many many others it was
standard View and correspondingly a loss
of control would threaten the project of
global dominance that was clearly
articulated during World War II and has
been sustained since in the face of
major changes in World Order there's a
further danger in the Middle East as
elsewhere there might be meaningful
moves towards democracy and that's a
threat and a look at uh Western studies
of public opinion in the Arab world
there are many of them uh and they're
pretty
consistent that makes it very clear why
democracy is a very severe threat it has
to be prevented as fully as possible the
United States and Western allies do not
want policies to be responsive to a
public that sees Israel in the United
States as the major threat so severe a
threat that many uh think that the
region would be better off if Iran had
nuclear weapons that's not what the West
wants obviously for the West the most
important states are the oil
dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and the
Emirates there the Democratic uprisings
have been brutally repressed with
Western support and tolerance uh
elsewhere particularly in Egypt the main
structure of the former military
dictatorship remains partially intact
it's threatened by popular forces and
that's quite a serious concern in the
west this is different from official
rhetoric but official rhetoric always
has to be regarded with extreme
skepticism for obvious reasons well
control of the Middle East remains
intact for the moment nevertheless
American decline is
continuing and a significant element of
it is that the decline is in no small
small measure
self-inflicted there's a recent study by
the economic policy Institute in
Washington that's the major source of uh
regular information and Analysis of the
economy their recent study is called
failure by
Design uh it reviews the data on the
impact of the neoliberal policies from
the past
generation that includes remarkable
concentration of wealth while wages have
stagnated or declined
working hours have increased far beyond
Europe and the weak benefit system has
been eroded it is now further threatened
the authors point out that the failure
is class-based the designers have
achieved spectacular success and they
also stress that it is by Design uh
alternative Poss policies were always
possible and still are and though I
won't go into it the same is true of
Europe uh corporate power just keeping
to the United States for for now the
corporate power is by now largely
Financial Capital it's become so
influential in the political system that
by now both parties are well to the
right of the population on major issues
under debate there are careful studies
of this by major political scientists
and they make it very clear that in the
collapsing political system the very
rich top few percent probably top on
Tenth of 1% if you could get adequate
polling data the very rich generally get
what they want whatever the public might
prefer the most recent detailed study
major study by Martin Gillan that shows
that for about 3/4 of the population
they are in his words powerless to shape
government policy doesn't matter what
they think uh and the mechanisms are by
no means
obscure however it's fair to say that
the US Federal Reserve the Central Bank
Al though heavily influenced by
Financial corporations looks pretty
Progressive in comparison with the
European Central Bank it's counter part
the US fed Central Bank has a formal
commitment to two tasks one is keeping
inflation from getting too high and the
second is reducing
Unemployment uh that uh uh latter
concern there is no threat of inflation
so it doesn't have to worry about that
the threat is
deflation the other commitment reducing
unemployment it does receive some
attention that's why the Federal Reserve
has been effectively printing money
trying to support a stimulus the
European Central Bank is quite different
its only formal commitment is to keep
inflation uh low it's for the benefit of
Bankers primarily the bundes bank uh
that provides a welcome opportunity to
dismantle the welfare State one of
Europe's great contributions to
civilization in the modern
period that's what we were seeing before
our eyes and uh the European Central
Bank president Mario dragi knew exactly
what he was saying when he informed The
Wall Street Journal that quoting him the
continent's traditional social contract
is obsolete not for any intrinsic reason
but by Design alternatives are
possible uh these self-inflicted blows
in the United States as in much of the
West are not a current Innovation they
trace back to the
1970s when the national political
economy uh underwent major
Transformations it brought to an end
what's commonly called the Golden Age of
capitalism should be called State
capitalism because of the massive State
intervention I'll keep here to the
United States but the process is
international taking different forms in
various parts of the state capitalist uh
World there were two major processes the
one was
financialization the second is
offshoring of production there were
reasons but the policies that were
adopted were by no means
necessary they reflected the increasing
power of international corporate Capital
increasingly
Financial they also reflected the
ideological Triumph of what are called
free market
doctrines uh which were used to
translate it into policies of sharp
decrease in taxes for the very rich in
the corporate sector
deregulation rules of corporate
governance that were designed to allow
salaries of top management to reach
unprecedented Heights and other such
policy decisions I stress again that the
term free market is a more propaganda
than reality the rich in the corporate
sector insist on a very powerful State
uh one that intervenes radically uh to
distort markets in their interest many
examples well the resulting
concentration of wealth yielded
automatically greater political power
that accelerated a vicious cycle that
has led to extraordinary wealth for
literally a tenth of 1% of the
population that's mainly a chairman of
major corporations managers of hedge
funds and so on meanwhile for the large
majority the real incomes have virtually
stagnated often
declined well in parallel the cost of
Elections has
skyrocketed right now it's millions of
dollars that drives both parties even
deeper into corporate Pockets where the
money is uh in the United States in the
current US electoral Force it's reached
the level of caricature
probably observing it uh the post Golden
Age economy is actually enacting a
nightmare which was envisaged by the
classical economists Adam Smith and
David
Ricardo both Smith and Ricardo
recognized that if British uh they're of
course concerned with Britain if British
merchants and manufacturers invested
abroad and relied on Imports they would
profit but England would suffer both of
them hoped that these consequences would
be averted by what's called home bias a
preference to do business in the home
country and to see it grow grow and
develop so therefore as if by an
invisible hand England would be saved
from the ravages of global markets
actually that's the only occurrence of
the phrase famous phrase invisible hand
in Adam Smith's classic Wealth of
Nations so it's kind of hard to miss
it's basically in the course of an
argument against neoliberal
globalization uh his immediate successor
Ricardo hoped that thanks to home bias
most men of property I'm quoting him now
most men of property would be satisfied
with a low rate of profits in their own
country rather than seek a more
advantageous employment for their wealth
in foreign Nations the feelings that I
should be sorry to see
weakened that's Smith and Ricardo in the
past 30 years the masters of mankind as
Smith called them have abandoned any
sentimental concern for the welfare of
their own Society
concentrating instead on short-term gain
and huge bonuses country be damned as
long as the powerful Nani State remains
intact to serve their
interests uh the there's a government
insurance policy which is colloquially
called too big to fail meaning banks
will be saved if they're too big no
matter what they do that government
insurance policy is estimated at about a
$60 billion annual taxpayer gift to the
biggest banks and that's only one small
illustration of the state subsidy to the
rich and
Powerful uh the emerging World Order is
very aptly described in a brochure for
investors which is produced by which was
produced a couple years ago by City
Group the city group is a huge bank
that's been feeding at the public trough
for 30 years in a cycle of risky loans
huge profits crash public bailout it's
happened again now what's been going on
since the early
80s uh the banks analysts describe a
world that's dividing into two blocks
one of them is what they call the
plutonomy the the rest is and then
there's the the rest the vast majority
sometimes they're called the global
precariat those who live a precarious
existence whether or not they're lucky
enough to have
employment uh in the United States
they're subject to Growing worker
insecurity That's the basis for a
healthy economy as Federal Reserve chair
Allan Greenspan explained to Congress
while lauding his performance in
economic management during the Clinton
years that's the real shift in power in
global Society not to China and India
but to the global
plutonomy uh the city group
analysts advise investors to focus on
the very rich that's where the action is
they have what they call a plutonomy
stock basket investments in
uh products and activities that benefit
the tiny super rich and they point out
that their plutonomy stock basket has
far
outperformed the world index of
developed markets since
1985 that's when the Reagan Thatcher
economic programs of enriching the very
wealthy and punishing the rest were just
taking
off before the
2007 crash for which they were largely
responsible the financial
institutions of the neoliberal failure
by Design had gained startl economic
power they had more than tripled their
share of corporate profits uh after the
crash a number of economists for the
first time began to inquire into their
function in purely economic terms
something that amazingly had never been
done before one Nobel laurate in
economics Robert
solo MIT he concludes from a study that
the general impact of financial
institutions is probably negative
they're harmful quoting him the
successes probably add little or nothing
to the to the efficiency of the real
economy while the disasters transfer
wealth from taxpayers to
finers the most respected Financial
correspondent in the English-speaking
world and Martin wolf of the London
Financial Times writes that the outof
control financial sector is eating out
the modern market economy from
inside just as the larvae of the spider
wasp eats out the host in which it has
been laid but it's a great success for
the fraction of 1% of the population who
are the designers of the current system
and not surprisingly its
beneficiaries well by shredding the
remnants of political
democracy they also lay the basis for
carrying the lethal process forward and
will continue to do so as long as
they're victim are willing to suffer in
silence
