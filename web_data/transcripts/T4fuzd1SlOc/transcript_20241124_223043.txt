Hello everybody and thank you so much for 
joining us for office hours with Noam Chomsky on  
this beautiful Tuesday afternoon. Before I go any 
further though, it is important that I acknowledge  
that we are holding this Q&A on the campus of the 
University of Arizona, which sits on the original  
homelands of indigenous peoples who have stewarded 
this land since time immemorial. We respectfully  
acknowledge the University of Arizona is on 
the land and territories of indigenous peoples.  
Today, Arizona is home to 22 federally recognized 
tribes with Tucson being home to the O'odham and the  
Yaqui. Committed to diversity and inclusion, 
the university strives to build sustainable  
relationships with sovereign native nations and 
indigenous communities through education offerings,  
partnerships, and community service. My name is Ally 
Devereaux. I'm a senior here at the University of  
Arizona, and I'm the ASUA Executive Vice President. 
I will be moderating this Q&A today and I'm  
so happy you all are here, whether you're on our 
beautiful campus here in Tucson or are remote wherever  
you live around the world. Here assisting with me 
today is Sydney Mathis, a senior majoring in Law,  
Spanish and Portuguese. And she is the ASUA center 
for the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences.  
Speaking with us today is, of course, 
the incredible professor Noam Chomsky.  
Noam Chomsky who joined the University of 
Arizona faculty in Fall 2017 is a laureate  
professor in the department of linguistics in 
the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences.  
He is also the Agnese Nelms Haury chair in the 
Agnese Nelms Haury program in environment and  
social justice. Professor Chomsky is one of the 
most influential public intellectuals in the world  
and is the founder of modern linguistics. He 
is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive  
scientist, historian, social critic, and political 
activist. Professor Chomsky is also a major figure  
in analytic philosophy and is one of the founders 
of the field of cognitive science. He first worked  
at Massachusetts's Institute of Technology where he 
established a new graduate program in linguistics.  
We now have the privilege of having him here 
on our staff at the University of Arizona.  
And as an undergraduate student, you can now take 
courses with him about the meaning and importance  
of language in our society. We did receive the 
questions you submitted when you were signing  
up and we will be using your submissions, but 
unfortunately we can't get to all of them. But  
you can also submit live questions to us using 
the Q&A button on the bottom right of your screen.  
Please make sure to include what college you are 
in in your submission. But without further ado,  
let's get started. So Professor Chomsky, 
our first question actually comes from me.  
So what would you say are the biggest changes 
you've noticed in our culture since the pandemic,  
whether that's linguistically, politically, 
socially, or anything else? Well of course,  
people have learned how to work individually. 
Speaking as a lecturer, I've learned how to  
try to do things virtually instead of 
in person. We face serious challenges.
The problem, it is known how to overcome the 
pandemic, but that requires a cooperative attitude. 
An attitude of willingness to be concerned 
for others. It's countries where that has  
been, where it's taken for granted in the 
culture have done quite well. The Asian countries  
and Oceania particularly which have emerged from 
the crisis quite effectively. Few others were those
commitments to cooperation, concern for the 
community, are less in place, less widespread,  
there have been problems that we're unfortunately 
a mixture. If you look at the map of
hot spots where are there serious 
epidemics, it's pretty telling. 
These are problems in the culture that 
are there and have been  
intensified during the crisis. There's 
another thing we should bear in mind.  
This isn't going to be the last pandemic. There 
was a major pandemic in 2003, the SARS epidemic.  
That one was contained. But scientists pointed 
out at the time that we should be prepared  
for another one, and it might be a worse one. 
There are lots of other possible coronavirus
that could develop turned into a crisis. Steps were 
barely taken. We're now hearing the same warnings,  
and we will either listen to them and respond and 
be in a position to fend off and overcome the next  
crisis when it comes, or else we'll be vulnerable 
to something that's even worse. There's another  
thing we should have learned, the rich countries 
have monopolized the vaccines for themselves  
and have been insistent on protecting the profit 
rights of the major corporations instead of  
following the model of the so-called "people's 
vaccine." Ensuring that the vaccine  
goes to the poor and vulnerable suffering 
all over the world who are desperately need it. 
And that for the period of the pandemic at least, 
there's much more to say to that about that,  
the stringent property rights should 
be relaxed so that others could produce  
and manufacture vaccines and reach the world. 
This is not only, I should say in this respect,  
the U.S. record is somewhat better than that of 
Europe, which has been the strongest. Especially  
Germany in insisting that the monopolies 
be maintained for the wealthy countries and  
for the pharmaceutical corporations. 
But no one has a good record on this,  
and it's not only morally outrageous but 
also suicidal. And it's known, the more  
the virus has an opportunity to mutate, the 
greater the chance that we'll get new and  
possibly more harmful variants. That's how the 
current Delta variant emerged. So it's morally
objectionable or worse and basically suicidal. But 
somehow, we can't seem to rise above that. It's not  
the only issue. Same is true of much more important 
issues like global warming, threat of nuclear war.  
It's not a good prognosis for the human 
species, unless this can be overcome.
And kind of in that same vein of eminent war, 
do you support the recent withdrawal of U.S.  
troops in Afghanistan and what are your thoughts 
on that whole thing? Well you can look back to  
what I wrote or I can send it to you with 
talks I gave a couple of months before.  
Personally the die was cast in 
February 2020 when President Trump
negotiated with the Taliban, excluding the Afghan 
government. They were not invited, even informed.  
Of course excluding the Afghan people, 
nobody pays attention to them.  
He made an arrangement with the Taliban 
that the U.S. would withdraw in May 2021, 
worst possible time. Onset of the fighting 
season, no time to repair to accommodate.  
He told that the agreement was the 
Taliban were free to do anything they wanted  
as long as they didn't fire on American 
troops, no other conditions. It's a disaster  
in the making. Well, Biden somewhat improved 
it, he extended the period a couple of months,
added some minimal conditions. 
But it's nevertheless, it  
it was clear very early that 
as soon as the American support  
was withdrawn the Afghan army would collapse, 
realize it's not a viable independent army. And  
the government, which is a morass of corruption 
with no support, popular support, would  
collapse and in fact flee as it did. It was all 
pretty obvious months in advance. But well
withdrawal, I think, was the right thing 
to do. But in a manner that followed the  
concerns and interests of the Afghan people.  
They are the ones who should have designed, 
developed the program for the withdrawal.  
We should have followed them. That doesn't mean 
the government, which was a corrupt non-entity,  
but the population itself. They were never brought 
into the discussion and they should have had a  
prominent role in it. There had to be withdrawal, 
the United States had no right to invade in  
the first place. This presence was making the 
situation worse. But the manner of the withdrawal  
could have been done in a more civilized way that 
was undercut once Trump made the original decision  
that could have been somewhat 
improved after that, but not very much.
Yeah and that question was from 
the College of Science, by the way.  
This next question is from the College of 
Social and Behavioral Sciences. Dennis Kuchenich  
has said that we have a "war economy", can you 
tell us why you agree or disagree with him?  
We've had a war economy for all almost 
all of my life since the second world war. 
Never went off a war economy. Immediately after 
the war, the United States was in a position of  
absolutely overwhelming power and security, and 
wealth had been nothing like that in human history.  
The United States had maybe almost half 
of the wealth of the world, controlled  
the whole hemisphere, controlled both oceans,
controlled the opposite sides of both oceans. 
Other industrial societies had been devastated. The U.S.
economy actually gained through the war.  
Manufacturing and production virtually quadrupled. 
The United States had been the richest country  
in the world for long before an amazing 
position. Well there was hope at the time  
which I remember very well for what was called a 
peace dividend. Let's move to a peacetime economy.  
That was dashed very quickly by development of 
a conflict which I don't think was necessary. And  
in retrospect, I think it's clear that it was 
unnecessary. The Russians were depicted as  
a horrendous monstrous force seeking to conquer 
the world. If you look at the internal documents  
that have been declassified, it's pretty shocking. 
Look at NSC 68, the main document, 1950, which  
called for a huge buildup of the war economy. 
Depicts the Russians as a slave state, which has a  
a mission that is part of their nature. They can't 
escape it. The mission is to conquer and suppress  
the whole world. In fact, there were knowledgeable, 
very knowledgeable, commentators like analysts, like  
George Cannon, who'd been the head of the state 
department policy planning system, a soviet expert.  
He said no this is not true. They don't like 
them. A lot of things are wrong, but they're not  
an aggressive power. They're a weak power. He was 
thrown out. Every China specialist in the country  
was expelled. It was left in the hands of war hawks 
people like, liberals incidentally, Dean Atchison,  
secretary of state. Who made it clear that he said, 
"we have to make things clearer than truth to force  
the mass mind of the government 
to follow our policies." The leading
Senator on Foreign Affairs, Robert Vandenberg, 
Republican, said, "we have to scare hell out of  
the country otherwise, we'll never get them able to 
accept this war-based system that we're developing."  
Well that happened, one thing after another. It's 
very interesting to look in the details of this  
time. I could talk about it, but manufactured crises 
have been developed over and over maintaining  
the war economy, war military-based economy. Huge 
military budget. Our military budget is roughly  
three-quarters of a true almost a trillion 
dollars if you add everything up. The next  
largest military budget in the world is China 
which is about a quarter of a billion dollars
per capita. For this Russia is 60 billion dollars 
below India but nevertheless we're being  
prepared now for another massive war-based economy 
with confronting China which is insanities  
where there cannot be. A conflict with China would 
destroy everything. There are problems that can be  
dealt with by diplomacy and negotiations as has 
been the case all along. And we have to move in  
that direction simply for survival. So we're 
in the midst of another example of what we've  
lived with, I've lived with, almost all my life 
75 years. And it's unnecessary and very dangerous.
Yeah. This next question is from the 
College of Social Behavioral Sciences  
and is: should high-level social media companies 
be allowed to ban people for offensive speech?  
Even officials like the 
President of the United States?
Well personally I was not in favor of 
that. I mean I could see an argument for  
banning Trump for maybe a week. The last week of 
his presidency when he was plainly out of control  
and it he might have done something 
extremely dangerous. That's why the top general  
with the accord of other militaries informed China 
don't take seriously anything that happened, might  
happen. That was a very dangerous moment. So I 
think you could make a case for a temporary ban.  
But I was not in favor of the longer term 
ban, as far as offensive speech is concerned.
There has to be some limit. I think myself 
that the basic principle is the one that was  
established by the supreme court in 1969. 
Brandenburg v. Ohio, the most important  
free speech judgment of the supreme court it was 
incidentally on a case involving the Ku Klux Klan.  
Not nice people and their decision 
was that speech should be free up until  
participation in imminent criminal acts. So for 
example, if you and I go into a store and rob it.  
And you have a gun and I say, "shoot." That's 
not protected speech. There's a range of  
interpretation of course, like all laws have a 
number of interpretation. But I think that's  
close to the principle we should keep to when 
speech is really dangerous, in imminent danger,  
participating in imminent danger, then it's 
justified to have a ban. In other cases, I  
think a heavy burden of proof has to be meant to 
ban speech. And in my opinion, it can rarely be met.
This next question is from the 
College of Social and Behavioral Sciences:  
what is the best piece of advice you 
could give to a young person today?
Well I'm asked that very often, and the first 
thought that comes to mind is not to take  
seriously any advice that you hear. Especially 
from people who don't know you very well.  
The answers to these questions have to 
come from within, there's no general advice.  
I never tried to give advice to my own children. 
They knew where I stood on things, they then had to  
find their own way. And I think that's the same 
for all of you. You have to find your own way.  
People can have suggestions. I could make some 
suggestions, shouldn't take them very seriously.  
But there's no general advice, there's 
individual choices that have to be made  
in the light of in personal individual 
circumstances. But maybe older people can  
help out with information, background, experience, 
and so on. But it's just a store of experience and  
information, sometimes knowledge, sometimes 
error, which you can draw from on your own.
So maybe the advice is to just follow yourself 
maybe. Don't listen to me, maybe, is the advice.  
I think it was given 2500 years ago by the Delphic 
oracle which had the maxim "Know they self."  
Figure out who you are honestly, where you 
belong in the world, what the world is like.  
Do it with humility, with care, with 
concern for others, and find your way.
I think that's great advice. So this next 
question is from the College of Science  
and they ask: what help is there in wealth equity  
if our democracy feeds into 
the wealth-power vicious cycle?
What hope? Disaster. No hope. This 
has been happening for the last  
40 years. It was bad enough before. For the past 
40 years, there have been programs: government  
programs, business programs, which have been 
carefully designed so as to radically increase  
wealth inequality to lead to sharp concentration 
of wealth in a very narrow part of the population,  
with the most of the rest living in a,  
really a majority by now, living in a  
relatively precarious situation. A real wages 
for non-supervisory workers are actually  
lower than they were in real terms than 40 
years ago. While enormous wealth has accumulated,  
this has led to a, it's not just here it's 
happened to a certain extent all over the world,  
more extreme here all from the same policies. 
So-called neoliberal policies which were designed  
so that they would have this effect and there are 
now some. And it's led to anger, resentment, fear,  
irrationality, hatred, breakdown of the social order.
Pretty much what you'd expect from such policies.  
It's true here. It's true elsewhere. There's 
actually been some efforts to measure it  
by high-level research institutions. The most 
careful was done by the Grand Corporation, a highly  
regarded quasi-governmental research institution, 
their estimate was that over the past 40 years,
almost 50 billion dollars had been transferred 
from the lower 90 percent of the population to  
the top fraction of one percent. That's pretty 
impressive, and it's a vast understatement. When  
Ronald Reagan entered office initiated 
these programs, he basically opened the  
spigot on lots of other options: tax 
havens, stock buybacks,  
rules of corporate management which allowed 
CEO's to basically set the wrong salaries.  
All sorts of other things. You add all this 
up it probably comes to I said billion, I  
should have said trillion dollars. It comes 
to roughly probably 780 trillion dollars  
taken from the lower 90 percent of the population 
working class, middle class, and if you look at  
where it went it's mostly to a fraction, 
a fraction of one percent of the population.  
0.1 of the population has doubled their share 
of wealth from 10% to 20% which is astonishing.  
Well these are policies, don't have to 
be pursued, can be reversed. There are  
in congress right now debates going on as we talk 
about efforts to do at least something about this.  
The Biden administration has put forth 
programs, which if enacted, would substantially
overcome some of the extreme harm that's 
been caused, not only to people but even to  
the infrastructure of the society which 
is collapsing. Well they're in a  
very tenuous position now the republicans are 
100% opposed, no break. Among the democrats 
those who are called moderate for some reason, 
I would call them right-wing democrats, like our  
senatorial representative, are opposed. 
They want to cut it back. Chances are it
won't go through. A major opportunity will 
very likely be lost to begin to compensate for the  
harm that's been caused by the policies 
of the past 40 years, which have been extremely  
harmful to our society and to many others 
that have been subjected to the same policies.  
And we're right at a turning point now. 
Popular action could make a big difference.  
If there was popular activist-engaged protests 
against this it could make a difference. Congressional  
representatives aren't immune to popular pressure. 
They may disregard it, but they're not immune to it.
This next question is from the College 
of SBS and it is: how do you respond to  
Kant's categorical imperative and how do 
you feel about Rawls's a theory of justice?
Rawls's theory of justice. Rawls actually was a 
personal friend. We discussed this book when it was  
coming out. Actually his, the original version of 
his book, it not was published, was actually based  
in part on grammatical models, the kind that it was 
working on. He received so much criticism for that,  
that he withdrew it. But there's now a subsequent 
book by a fine young philosopher, John Mikhail,
m-i-k-h-a-i-l. He's now a professor of law at 
Georgetown. He did a thesis in a book in which he  
argued that the original model was the correct one 
and that if you pursued it you could develop an  
approach to developing a theory of 
justice, which actually had roots in human  
moral nature. The innate moral nature 
opened experimental work on this, others  
have now carried it on. But Rawls's book was a major 
contribution. It reframed thinking for a generation  
about the nature of justice, about fairness, so 
on. You could agree or disagree with it, but it  
was carefully done, very thoughtful. Same is true 
of his lectures on moral philosophy which have  
been published, which are marvelous introductions 
of the subject. Personally, I personally don't quite  
agree with a lot of conclusions but they 
certainly have to be taken very seriously.
And what about Kant's categorical imperative? 
Well, categorical imperative is nice to  
say but nobody's gonna live up to it. It's nice 
to think about, but if your child is being
on the verge of being run over by a car 
and there's another child nearby who you  
you don't know who's being in the same 
predicament. You know what you're gonna do.
And both of these questions come 
from the College of Science, but they  
seem kind of similar. What role does media 
play in shaping linguistics and do you think  
modern grammatical theory properly explains this 
evolution of human language with social media?  
Well what's changed by social media is usage 
of language, not language. The language itself  
emerged, it seems roughly at the time that 
modern humans emerged, narrow period. And it  
hasn't changed since. The faculty of language as 
far as we know is shared among all humans. They  
seem to speak very different languages, but when 
you look closely, one of the main discoveries of  
modern linguistics and cognitive science, is that 
when you look closely they're not very different.  
They're fundamentally based on the same mold. 
The same incidentally has been discovered about  
organisms. If you go back 50 or 60 years, 
biologists assume that organisms are so different  
that each has to be studied on its own. They can 
vary in almost all possible ways. It's now known  
that they're all virtually identical they 
are based on the same principles, deep
principles that don't change.
It's gone to the point where some serious 
molecular biologists have suggested there may even  
be a universal genome with minor modifications. 
It's not accepted, but it's not considered observed.  
What does change is usage. So your 
use of language is going to be  
somewhat different from my use of language, because 
of peer pressures, generational changes, and so on.  
When I listen to my grandchildren, it's 
a lot different from the way I talk. But  
it's the same language, and it hasn't changed 
for probably a couple hundred thousand years.
And this next question comes 
from the College of Science: 
what are your thoughts on the 
United States version of capitalism?
And what steps, if any, do you believe should 
be taken to combat all of its shortcomings?
Well there are narrow questions and 
deeper questions. If we look at the  
evolution of American capitalism which I 
think should be called state capitalism.  
There are no truly capitalist countries. A country 
that was truly capitalist would self-destruct in  
no time. The people who Adam Smith called 
the masters of mankind, the main manufacturers,  
merchants, business interests, they would never 
permit capitalism. They want a powerful state  
to intervene to protect them from the ravages 
of the market. We see this constantly. The last 40  
years there's been crash after crash after Reagan 
initiated the period of, actually Carter initiated  
radar extended, the period of deregulation. 
So financialization, so crash after crash,  
each time the government (that means the population) 
has to step in to rescue the perpetrators.  
That's always been true to some extent. In fact, 
a large part of the technology that we enjoy,  
the vaccines that we use, come from government 
spending. Very substantial part. Business wants  
the public to take the risks and pay the costs. And 
they'll make the profits, so it's state capitalism.  
But it's gone through various periods starting in 
the 1930s, my childhood, there was the initiation  
in the United States of moves towards social 
democracy. While Europe was moving towards fascism,  
the United States was leading the way 
towards social democracy under the new deal.  
Big bitter struggle. I remember it very well,
but it achieved quite a lot well that lasted,  
was on hold through the war, picked up again at the 
end of the second world war with a major struggle.  
Major business effort to reverse it. Major popular 
effort to sustain and expand it. That conflict  
went on for 20 -25 years, finally the business 
interests prevailed and we had moved into it.  
That period was sometimes called regimented 
capitalism. The state played a powerful role in  
in maintaining taxation which was moderately 
progressive, controlling financial institutions.  
Banks were banks, not firms, making risky 
investments which the government would  
bail them out for if they collapsed. It was 
was the greatest period of growth in American  
history, capitalist history, and pretty egalitarian 
birth. The lowest quintile did about as well as the  
highest quintile. This is the Eisenhower period, 
the 1960s, began in the 70s, began to change.  
Was a major business counter-offensive began to 
move towards what became the neo-liberal programs  
in which huge changes were made, leading to 
the system that I've, to what I, described since.  
Basically stagnation for the majority. 
Enormous wealth for a tiny percentage.  
Crisis after crisis as the effects of 
financialization and deregulation took place. 
Such a change in the tax structure that for the 
first time in a century, billionaires actually pay  
a lower rate than people who work for them.
Well all going back to the narrow and broader  
kinds of reform. The narrow kind of reform 
could be a return to a form of social democracy.
In the post-war period, Europe picked up 
and developed further the kinds of social  
democratic policies that had been pioneered in the 
United States. So if you take a look at European  
countries now, they're quite different than us. 
I think Germany, in Germany a working person  
has two months of paid vacation automatically. 
It's universal healthcare, a free higher education.
If a couple has a baby, they get about I think 
14 months of joint maternal and paternal leave.  
There's child care provided,
many amenities provided now.  
You'll see you can read some economists who 
will say, "well they sacrifice by having lower  
GDP per capita." Yeah if people work two months 
less, GDP is going to be less. But maybe leisure  
is something worthwhile okay. That's possible. 
Americans have almost none of this. In fact, if you-  
There are popular forces moving 
towards it. Bernie Sanders is the most  
outspoken figure. But if you take a look at 
Sanders's policies by European standards,
it's so normal. In fact, one of the editors 
of the world's leading business journals,  
Financial Times in London, quipped that if Sanders 
was running in Germany, he could be running on the  
conservative party program. Which is pretty much 
true. He's calling for universal health care,  
which almost everybody has outside the United States.  
Both of our neighbors; for example, Canada 
and Mexico, Europe, Brazil, anywhere you look.  
Free higher education, they have it not very far 
from us in Mexico. But much of Europe elsewhere.  
These are important moves. They would move the 
United States back towards the center of the  
rich developed societies in terms of concern for 
welfare of the population. It's being, there's a  
struggle about it right now in congress, which 
I mentioned. We don't know which way it'll go.  
The Biden programs wouldn't lead 
to this, but they'd be a step  
towards it. So that's the kind of change 
which I think is easily feasible. To say  
let's go back to the economy of the Eisenhower 
years. It doesn't sound terribly radical okay.  
Eisenhower, himself, said that anyone who questions 
new deal measures doesn't belong in our political  
system. By now they're not only questioned 
but rejected by much of the political system.  
Well that's a narrow change, I don't incidentally 
want to glorify those years. There was plenty wrong  
with them, but we're talking about a narrow 
question. Now what about a further question?  
Well that's worth thinking about. For 
about 2,000 years of western history,  
it was taken for granted that the worst 
assault on human rights and human dignity  
was to be subservient to some other person, to take 
orders from a master. But we have a phrase for that,  
it's called getting a job. Meaning 
for your and almost entire waking life,  
you're a servant to a master. You follow orders. 
In a manner, for most working people that's  
worse than what exists in totalitarian 
states. Stalin, for example, couldn't tell you  
you can only go to the bathroom at three o'clock 
in the afternoon for five minutes. And you can't  
talk to anybody on the way there, and you have to 
wear these clothes, and you have to move on this  
path if you're an Amazon worker. Not on a different 
path and we monitor you to make sure you're doing  
it. That's called having a job for most people. 
Right through the 19th century, that was considered  
an abomination. If you look back at American 
history, the late 19th century, there were two  
huge popular movements. One was the radical 
farmers movement, this was an agrarian country  
at the time. Farmers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma 
joined together and decided they wanted to be free  
of the control of northeastern bankers and market 
managers, to run their own affairs. To create what  
they called a "cooperative commonwealth" in which 
farmers would get together and collectively  
run their own affairs. In parallel to this in 
the industrial east, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts  
a working-class movement was developing. It created 
a huge labor movement, Knights of Labor, which was  
incidentally some of its first activities 
were organizing black workers in Louisiana.  
It was biracial, plenty of flaws like everything. 
But fundamentally working for the same goals:  
cooperative commonwealth, workers should own and 
manage their own enterprises, we should never have  
to follow orders of a boss, we should never 
have our labor stolen from us by someone who  
owns capital. That was the motto the Knights of 
Labor, and the farmers movement was then called  
the populist movement. Different, not what populism 
means today. They began to get together. If they had,  
it would be a very different country, 
a country with real radical democracy.  
They were crushed by state and corporate force. 
The United States has a very violent history of  
labor history, much more so than comparable 
countries. But these are further things that  
we might think about. I don't think they're 
far below the surface, so that's a much  
farther goal. Should we accept a system in 
which some people take orders, others give  
them, and that's almost your entire waking life?
I think that's a question worth considering.
Kind of in that similar vein,
what do you think of the phrase  
"Aren't we more free when our basic needs are 
met?" and what do you say to libertarians who  
would not want to sacrifice their private 
property rights for an ideal like this?
Well what are property rights? I mean you 
have a right to the property that you use.  
Definitely, nobody's questioning that. Do you have a 
right to property that you don't use but that you  
employ to rent people to make profit from you? 
That's another question. Do you have a right  
to be demanding a society in which constant 
power is concentrated in very few hands, which are
basically totalitarian? They have total control 
over everything they do. Everyone else has  
a right to rent themselves to them for survival. 
Well that's another question. Do you have a right  
to interfere with another person's right? Well 
if you have if you have an estate which nobody  
else can live on and you're not using it, you're 
interfering with other people's rights. In fact, the  
biggest popular movement in the world and one of 
the most important, about which not enough is known,  
is what's called the landless workers movement 
in Brazil. It's a movement of working people,  
peasants, farmers, who occupy lands that are 
owned but not used by rich landowners. They face  
plenty of harassment. Police come in, armies come 
in, corporate paramilitaries come in, try to drive  
them out. But they've made substantial gains, large 
parts. And they've moved on to form something like  
the kind of cooperative commonwealth that 
radical farmers in the United States were  
trying to develop back in the late 19th 
century. It's a pretty impressive movement.  
One of the courses that I co-taught last fall, 
last winter, with one of the sessions had a  
spokesperson from them describing 
their activities. These are the kind-
It's a country, sort of. It's not as 
rich as the United States obviously. But  
basically structured in a similar 
way. Well those are possibilities. So  
if you really ask what the so-called 
American libertarians are calling for,  
They're basically calling for tyranny. 
They're calling for a system in which  
people will have the capacity to amass property 
and wealth without limit, without interference,  
and use it to dominate and control 
others who will have no choice.  
I should say, if you want a personal 
anecdote, I was introduced to libertarian  
thought 70 years ago when I was a graduate student 
at Harvard. And there was an invited lecturer  
by the guru of the libertarian movement 
Ludwig von Mises, Austrian libertarian. He  
gave a speech on, I attended it, on why the 
government is responsible for unemployment.  
That was his speech and it was accurate. What he 
said is: suppose that some guy is starving and  
I'm a rich owner and I offer him a miserable job 
for 10 cents an hour under horrible conditions.  
Well he's starving, he'd probably take it. But 
then the evil government steps in and imposes  
regulations saying you have to pay people enough 
to live on, you have to have safety conditions.  
And because of that, he can't take the job. The 
evil government is forcing him to be unemployed.  
Now if we had a real libertarian society, he'd 
be free to take the job if we could only get the  
government off our backs. Well I was watching 
the faces of the graduate students at Harvard, 
a fair number of them accepted that. They're the 
ones who go on to be rich corporate lawyers and  
executives and libertarians. There were others 
who were horrified. They went in a different path.
So almost taking you back to that age, 
if you were around 19 years old today,  
what would you be doing and why? 
This is from the College of SBS.  
Well I could tell you what I was doing then. But 
what I was doing then was deciding is it even  
worthwhile to continue with college? Its stupid 
and ridiculous, I want to do something else.  
By a series of accidents, I stayed in the 
university system. And in retrospect, I'm  
very glad that those accidents took place. 
But as to what I would be doing today,  
probably something not well thought out. That's 
the age. I should say that there's actually a  
gender difference. Women's brains mature at 
around 20 or so, men's brains don't mature until  
maybe five years later and this shows up in many ways. 
But you can make a lot of mistakes, which  
is not terrible you have time to correct them. 
But there are things that really should be done.  
Definitely and lots of young people are doing 
them. A couple of days ago, there was a, Friday  
I think, there was an international 
climate strike. That was young people, huge numbers  
in Europe. Germany featured Greta Thunberg. Other 
countries made huge demonstrations almost all  
young people. They are in the forefront of 
trying to save humanity from self-destruction.  
It's shameful that it has to be young people. It's 
shameful that Greta Thunberg had to stand up at an  
invited talk at the Davos meetings. The
annual meetings of the rich and powerful, masters  
of mankind. And she had to get up and give a talk 
ending with "you have betrayed us", which is correct.  
My generation, next younger generation, have 
betrayed the youth as a country. We have  
knowingly created a situation that they're going 
to inherit. I won't be here, but you will. In which  
it may be impossible for humans to survive in an 
organized form. We've known for decades what has  
to be done about this. More information is coming 
along. Latest IPCC report on August 9th gave a much  
more dire analysis than in the past. But the 
basics have been understood since the 1980s  
and the opportunity was lost. If 
it had been taken 40 years ago,  
be a lot easier to handle if it had been 
undertaken 10 years ago it would have been a lot  
easier to handle. If we let it go another 10 
years it may be virtually impossible to handle.  
I mean it's understood. We know it has to be done. 
There are feasible measures, very feasible measures,  
which could mitigate the crisis, lead to a much 
better world, a survivable world, which we could  
go on to develop further. Pursue some of these 
other things we've been talking about. But none  
of that will be possible unless this challenge 
is met, and met soon. And unfortunately it's, well  
maybe fortunately, for your generation there's a 
challenge that has never risen in human history.
That's hard to bear in one respect.  
But an exciting prospect and another. It's in your 
hands to determine whether organized human society  
will survive. My generation failed 
miserably on this. Now it's your turn.
So I remember last time you mentioning you don't 
go on social media much but you read a lot about  
it. So for this next question: for children 
growing up in a digital world where most of our  
information we consume is fed by algorithms made 
by large corporations and they're not self-sought  
out, how would you re-imagine the usage of digital 
learning tools to teach children how to think and  
generate new frameworks for thought rather than 
simply regurgitating trending talking points?
Well I'm an old-fashioned conservative. 
I think the best way to learn to think  
is for example to go to the local library 
or to the university library, find books,  
find other people who want to discuss 
them, form groups where you talk about them.  
Kind of what we did in graduate school. 
I think that's a lot better than  
being obsessed with social 
media. I got my own education.
Anecdote again, I got mostly because I was 
lucky to get to get a fellowship at Harvard,  
which didn't pay much. But allowed me to have 
a desk at Widener Library, fantastic library,  
one of the best libraries in the world. They go 
in there in the morning, have a desk, do your work,  
walk around the stacks, find fascinating things, 
pick them up, go to the local bookstore which  
used to exist lots of them. And you find very 
interesting things, you find people who are looking  
at them, want to talk about it, set up discussion 
groups. You get an education, I don't know  
any better way. Maybe something can be done 
with digital systems but I don't think it's  
going to be an increment. All of these things have 
to come basically from within, and the decline of  
reading is very serious. I can see it all 
the time, just in my own life. I get tons of mail.  
A lot of it from young people, a lot of good 
questions. They want to know what's your  
reason for saying this, what's the source and 
so on. But they want a source that's online.
I mean I've had letters from kids in fancy prep 
schools, the fancy schools in New England where  
rich kids go. A high educational standard 
saying things like I have an assignment for  
next week on so and so, can you give me 
some advice as to what I can look at?  
So I say, well in the library across the 
street, you can find this in that book which  
could be helpful. I get a letter back saying no 
I want something online. I can't walk across the  
street. I want to just push a button. Well you're 
not going to have critical thinking that way.
I agree. Maybe they should attend more Noam 
Chomsky Q&A's and maybe that'll help too. 
But kind of, you kind of touched on it like 
for a second, but you've been quoted saying,  
"If we don't believe in freedom of expression 
for people we despise, we don't believe in it  
at all." Would you revise this now or qualified 
or change it? Not at all, more so than ever.  
That's been true always. The cancel 
culture as it's called is very familiar.  
It's existed all my life, but it's been directed 
against the left so nobody paid attention to it.  
I could give you plenty of examples from my 
own experience. What's changed now is that  
some sectors of young people who regard 
themselves as on the left, have picked up  
some of the standard devices that have been 
used for years to suppress freedom of speech.  
It's wrong in principle. It's tactically 
suicidal. The principle I think is obvious, the  
tactics, you can see what happens. It's a gift 
to the right. You drive somebody off campus  
because you don't like what they're saying, 
they love it. It's a shot in the arm for them.  
They can stand up as defenders of freedom and 
justice against the left-wing totalitarians. You  
want to have a reasonable response to them, invite, 
have them come on campus. Set up if you want to an  
alternative meeting where you discuss their 
ideas, expose them, let people think about them.
You'll pretty soon find they 
don't even want to come to campus.  
That's the way you deal with ideas you don't like. 
Not by trying to suppress them, that's tactics.  
But the more important thing is principle.
If you think about the statement you quoted,  
Stalin and Hitler were perfectly happy 
to support speech that they liked.
We don't consider them 
defenders of freedom of speech.
And that question was from the college of SBS and 
so is this next one: the US- China relationship  
is getting worse after Tiananmen Square. But China 
has serious human rights issues in Hong Kong. Will  
China be a threat to the world as some politicians 
claim? And will china be authority right-wing or  
authority left-wing in the future, in your opinion? 
Well there's not much that China can do about  
our problems, and there's not much we can do about 
their problems. We can object to things we think  
are wrong. They can object to things they think are 
wrong. But it's not much more than that. Now what  
about is China a threat to the world? I mean is 
the United States a threat to the world when it
institutes essentially Jim Crow style policies 
to bar minorities from voting? It's a threat  
to the American people, it's not a threat to the 
world. China carries out human rights abuses in  
Xinjiang province. We should protest it,
should say it's wrong, but we should also say  
what about the comparable or worse 
problems that we are carrying out right now?  
And they exist, so for example, to take one striking 
example, it's claimed that a million people  
went through China's Uyghurs, went through China's 
reeducation camps and suffered pretty severe human  
rights abuses. That's a million people, certainly 
shouldn't happen. There happens to be the biggest  
open-air prison in the world which has two million 
people in it, a million children. Gaza, it's called,  
which is subjected to some of the worst human 
rights abuses in the world. They don't have  
water to drink, power stations have been crushed 
and destroyed, sewage systems destroyed, constant  
murderous attacks no pretext, using American 
weapons. When they run, this is Israel, when they run  
out of weapons, they turn to the big boy across the 
ocean who is replenishing the weapons. This just  
happened again a few days ago when congress voted 
another billion dollars to replenish
military equipment that Israel expended 
during the war. It was defended on human  
rights grounds. They said well this is the 
iron dome defensive system, can't prevent people  
from defending themselves. Did anybody suggest 
providing something to help the people of Gaza  
defend themselves from incomparably worse attacks? 
That doesn't cross our minds. We're committed to  
severe human rights abuses easily comparable to 
anything that's described in Xinjiang province.  
Do we do anything about it? No, we object to the 
threat posed by others. Well somebody mentioned  
the categorical imperative earlier, so let's think 
about it, let's think about the golden rule, other  
famous moral principles. We should be thinking 
we should or know thyself the Delphic oracle,  
we should first ask ourselves what can we do? We 
can protest what other people are doing, can't  
do much about it. We can do something about what 
we're doing. We didn't get excited about Russian  
operatics who condemned the US war in Vietnam, 
That's easy, if they condemned the practices  
of the Soviet Union. We honored and respected 
them. Sakharov, Solzhenitsyn, and others same  
principles apply here. Well let's talk about 
the question of threats. China is internally  
highly repressive, highly authoritarian, doing 
lots of things it shouldn't be doing. Those are  
completely wrong. They're threats to the people 
of China. They're not threats to us. China's doing  
some things internationally which are wrong. 
In fact in violation of international law.  
So in the South China Sea, China's taking actions 
which are in violation of international law.  
Is the United States in any 
position to protest about them? 
We're the only maritime country 
that doesn't even accept the law.  
We're a country that carries out 
piracy on the high seas, the greatest  
maritime crime. When we, the US Navy, intercepts 
boats, ships, carrying which they claim  
are carrying Iranian oil to Venezuela and 
drives them to American ports that's piracy.  
Subject to the death penalty, the worst maritime 
crime. Do we say anything about it? No we applaud.  
Yeah we're doing the right thing. So 
we're in general in no position to
object to China's violations, and they are 
violations, in the South China Sea. These  
should be dealt with by regional powers. The US 
can back them if it likes through negotiations,
diplomacy, settlement, accommodations 
as in many other places.  
There are the what we call the threat of China 
is not in the Caribbean, it's not on the borders  
of California, it's on the borders of China. What 
we call the threat of China is on China's borders.  
What we call the threat of Russia 
is on Russia's borders. That should  
get us to think for a minute. We might 
also ask is China maybe facing a threat?  
China is ringed with missiles, with nuclear armed 
missiles, from hundreds of US bases. Some of the  
800 and so bases that the US has around the world. 
Many of them surrounding China, armed with nuclear  
armed missiles, China has one in Djibouti 
in Africa. Is China may be facing a threat? 
Are we facing a threat? In fact, you know we're not 
totally secure. Nobody is. But we are more secure  
than any country in the world. I mean 9/11 was 
a big surprise. But remember it's the first time  
that the US territory was attacked since 1812. 
Can you think of any other country like that?
We attack others. We don't get attacked. So yes, 
we should be serious about the threats that exist  
and work to mitigate them. And what we are actually 
doing is working to accelerate and exacerbate them.  
So the response to the alleged China threat 
is not to send a naval armada into the South  
China Sea any more than they should respond 
to us by sending an armada into the Caribbean.  
That's not the answer. The answer is 
not to send, make a deal with Australia  
to provide them with nuclear submarines 
which are advertised publicly by US high  
figures as being able to sink the Chinese navy 
in three days, and are able to appear in Chinese  
ports unannounced at any time armed with nuclear 
weapons. That's not the way to reduce tensions and
problems. It's a way to 
instigate a hostile reaction,  
which can then escalate in the familiar cycle, 
even get out of control which case we're all dead, 
finished. We can't have a war with China or any 
other nuclear state. The state that initiates  
the war will be destroyed. So that's out of 
the question. And we should think about the fact  
that the US strategic posture 2018 under Trump 
so far carried over under Biden, even extended.  
The strategic posture is to prepare to 
win simultaneous wars against Russia and China.  
That's carrying insanity to the point 
beyond where words exist to describe it.  
You can't have a nuclear war with either of them, 
and expect civilization to describe to survive.  
Well these are things we 
ought to be thinking about.  
And a lot of them are right before our eyes. 
The nuclear sub deal was just a couple weeks ago.
And this next question is from the College of SBS.
What is a question you wish people asked you more 
and what would be your answer to that question?
Well probably the one that comes 
most is from people your age.  
What I'm guessing is your age, who say I'm lost, 
I don't know what to do, I can't figure out  
what to do with my life, everything seems too 
hard and impossible, what can I do? 
Some variant of that is probably the most common 
question and it's the kind of question that should  
appear come to mind for somebody your age. Came 
to my mind when I was your age. It's the kind of thing  
you should be thinking about. But not asking 
for any advice about. We've talked about that.
Is there a particular question that 
you wished people asked you about? 
Like is there a topic that's like really niche 
or something, that you wish people asked you about?
I guess you get asked everything 
under the sun. A number of the questions  
that were asked here, I think should be asked a 
lot more. Including the more far-reaching ones,  
we should ask the question whether
working people and farmers, many 
of them without formal education  
in the late 19th century, whether they were correct 
in agreeing with two millennia of western thought  
that subordination to a master is intolerable. I 
think people should be asking that. Do you have  
to accept it? I don't think so. There are other 
forms of social organization, like the ones that
farmers and workers without formal education 
were striving for. If you read their press,  
very lively labor press, a lot of it written by 
young women who incidentally were called factory girls.  
Women who were driven off the farms into the mills, 
had their own very lively very interesting press.  
It's all available, even online, and very 
interesting reading, very thoughtful.  
Lots of ideas and working towards some conception 
of a kind of cooperative commonwealth of people  
working together. Mutual aid, mutual support, common 
interests, not just I'm out for myself to be  
ahead of the next guy. Not that. Well that's 
very valuable to think about.
So kind of in that same vein what is one of 
your top issues that's on your mind right now and  
what gives you hope about it? Or do you not have hope 
about it or et cetera? Well right now there are  
two topics that should be on 
the top of everyone's mind.  
One of them going back to what you said 
before, what question do I wish were asked more.  
Here's one. What can we do about the increasing 
and ominous threat of nuclear war? It is very  
serious, it's growing. It's worse than it has 
been, with very few exceptions, for 75 years.
And there's almost no attention being paid 
to it. Neither political party is interested,  
the media aren't interested. Take a 
look at the political conventions.  
Nothing was said about it. It's one of the two 
major, major threats to survival of organized  
human life on earth. There are comparable threats 
and that's what should be in the top of our minds.  
One is, and it's beginning to get some attention 
at least, the threat of environmental destruction.  
That's not just heating the atmosphere, habitat 
destruction, pollution of the oceans, destruction  
of possibilities of agricultural production, all 
of that is combined into environmental destruction.  
Left on our present course, we will soon 
reach irreversible tipping points. Doesn't  
mean everybody's going to die tomorrow, but 
we'll be on a course which can't be changed  
towards essentially destruction of organized human 
life on earth. That's one, the other is the severe  
and growing threat of nuclear war that should be 
on the top of our minds. And that one is not being  
discussed at all. Now in both of these cases, we 
know how to deal with them. The means are there,  
feasible means within grasp can make a better 
world. We're not taking them. Those are two things  
that be on the top of our minds. Another thing 
that should be on the top of our minds is the  
collapse of the social order. It's 
not as tangible, but it's very real.  
The collapse of an atmosphere of 
rational interchange and discourse.  
It shows up in many ways. You take a 
look at polls of people's attitudes,  
it's shocking really shocking. I could go 
through examples and people have moved into such  
impenetrable bubbles, they can't 
even talk to each other about it.  
Families break up over whether you're gonna vote 
Republican or Democrat. I mean it's just  
it's a reflection of the collapse of the social 
order. The effects of what I described earlier.
40 years of an assault on the general population, 
forced atomization, disruption, breakdown of social  
organization, attack on labor unions, the main means 
of defense, turning people into a society of  
atomized people living a precarious existence. 
That's going to have effects on the  
moral and intellectual climate, and 
it's having them. That's serious.  
These choices incidentally are not just my own. 
Those of you who follow the course of the famous  
doomsday clock, the clock of the bullet of atomic 
scientists, which was established in 1947 after the  
atom bombings. So try to give a concise 
picture of the state of the world. The 
hands of the clock are set a certain distance 
from midnight based on analysis of the world's situation.  
Midnight means termination. It was set at 
seven minutes to midnight in 1947, oscillated  
over the years. Since the Trump administration, 
every year it's been moved closer to midnight.  
A couple of years ago, it reached the closest point 
it had ever been two minutes to midnight. After  
that the analysts abandoned minutes they moved 
to seconds. It's now a hundred seconds to midnight.  
My guess is next January, it'll probably move 
closer. Well they mentioned three major things.  
One the growing threat of nuclear weapons, two 
the threat of environmental destruction and the  
fact that leaders in the world are not acting 
to respond to it. The third, the breakdown of an  
atmosphere of rational civilized interchange. Might 
sound as if that doesn't belong with the first two,  
but it does. Because if you can't overcome that, 
there'll never be a way of dealing with the others.  
So those are the things that I think 
should be uppermost in our minds.
This next question is from the College of SBS,
they thank you for sharing your insights so far.  
And they want to know, how 
would you account for human greed  
in your idea of a stateless socialist 
system, or anti-capitalist in general?
I don't think human greed is, it's 
certainly a aspect of human nature.  
So is kindness and sympathy, a 
human nature incorporates both.  
Each of us by our nature could be a saint or a 
sinner, probably we're all a mixture of each.
Well how it eventuates in the course of 
the way a human person grows and develops  
is in part heavily influenced by the social system 
in which you're in, the prevailing ideologies.  
What's called prevailing common sense, what's 
taken for granted, part of it is just your own  
will and choice. Nobody understands that. But 
science has nothing to say about it. We all know  
we have that option. Well that turns into whether 
you're a person who wants to to go back to my  
lesson on libertarian thought 75 years ago, 
depends that's the kind determines whether  
you're the kind of person who cheers at the idea 
that if we could only get rid of the government,
we'd get rid of unemployment. If you want to 
cheer at that, you're one kind of person. If you're  
abhorred by that, you're a different kind of person. 
They're both within the range of human nature.
And someone from the College of SBS just 
wants to clarify what is the increasing  
threat of nuclear-worthy that you're referencing? Is 
it belligerence between nuclear powers?  
is it a heightened risk of acquisition of 
nuclear weapons by non-nuclear powers? Is it  
abandonment of treaties or in what terms are you 
speaking of? Well that's a very important question.  
That's a shame that it even has to be asked. 
It's a shame that it's not constantly discussed  
and in the forefront of our attention. So in 
fact everything that was mentioned, I mentioned  
the exorbitant military budgets. This is 
at a time when we badly need resources.  
Close to a trillion dollars for us is being spent, 
mostly in waste, preparation for destruction. A lot  
of it for developing more destructive 
weapons which will eliminate us as well.  
So one thing is developing is even having 
and developing more destructive weapons. The US
is moving towards militarization of space. 
A violation of the outer space treaty. That's  
lunacy. It's destructive for everyone, including 
us. They're not going to be able to control it.  
We initiate militarization of space, others 
will follow. We're all in more danger. Take  
over the last 60 years there has been 
painful slow moves towards trying to control, to  
put not to put this genie back into the bottle, 
but at least make it harder for her to get out.  
To control the threat, arms control agreements 
started with Eisenhower with the beginnings of  
the Open Skies Treaty. Then other presidents since,
big step forward, with Reagan under intensive  
popular pressure. Hugest demonstrations in 
history here in the United States opposing  
short-range missiles in Europe which greatly 
increased the threat of war. Finally Reagan  
and Gorbachev reached an agreement 1987 to ban 
these weapons. That substantially increased the  
likelihood of peace. There was an anti-ABM treaty. 
Very important. Every strategic analyst knows that  
although ABM sounds defensive, it's actually 
an offensive weapon. It's a weapon that says  
maybe we can somehow fend off a first strike so 
we can destroy the enemy with the second strike.  
It's an offensive weapon. Everyone understands 
that you put ABMs on the Russian border,  
it's a threat to them. And they understand 
it. There wasn't anti-ABM treaty. 
There were other treaties, the Republican party 
in this century has been dismantling them.  
George W Bush dismantled the ABM treaty. When 
Trump came along, he wanted to dismantle everything.  
Trump's general policy was a wrecking ball. He 
dismantled the INF treaty, intermediate range  
missile treaty, was moving towards destroying 
the Open Skies Treaty, was just about to end the  
last of the standing treaties, the New Start Treaty, 
which limits Russian and American nuclear weapons. 
There are way too many of them, but this at least 
limits them. That was due to expire on February 5th. 
bidden was elected just in time, within hours, 
to ratify the treaty as the Russians had been  
imploring the US to do. So that one's still 
there. Much of the rest has been dismantled. Well  
 there's another treaty 
called the Non-Proliferation Treaty,  
which we signed, which obligates 
us to pursue good faith measures  
to eliminate nuclear weapons. There's a treaty in 
force, now a few months ago, international treaty  
signed by 120 or so countries calling for the 
prohibition of development of nuclear weapons.  
Well not one nuclear state has signed it, but we 
could have a role in influencing other states  
to move towards it. And there are many other things 
that could be done. Plenty of them. Just mention  
one which is immediate, one very positive move 
would be to establish nuclear weapons-free zones  
in the world. So regions which say we don't 
have anything to do with nuclear weapons,  
it doesn't get rid of them, but it's significant. 
There are quite a few, but they can't go into force.  
Primarily because of us. There's a 
nuclear weapons-free zone in the pacific.  
Can't go into force because the United 
States insists on maintaining nuclear weapons 
facilities on its specific islands. There's an 
African nuclear weapons free zone treaty, can't  
go into force because the United States 
maintains a nuclear-armed military base  
on an island which under F international law 
belongs to Africa. It was a British island.  
And Britain, which is by now just a vassal of 
the United States, agreed to oppose international  
law and to insist on holding the island in 
violation of the United Nations world court  
to drive out all the population so the US
could establish a military base there, which  
was raised by Obama to a nuclear base. It's not 
symbolic. It's the base that's used for bombing  
central Asia and the middle east, so the African 
treaty can't go into effect. There is a western  
hemisphere treaty. Well two countries block it, 
the United States and Canada. We insist on nuclear  
weapons. The most important such zone would be the 
Middle East, a highly volatile region. The nuclear  
weapons free zone in the 
Middle East would end the alleged threat of Iran.  
Iran is supposed to be a major threat. Its 
nuclear weapons programs are on the front pages.  
Terrible danger, what can we do? Well one thing 
we could do, of course, is go back to the treaty  
that we pulled out of, which was terminating 
development of them. If we don't want to do that, we  
could move towards a nuclear weapons free zone in 
the region. Well, with intensive inspections,  
we know they can work. They worked very well before 
the US pulled out of the joint agreement with Iran.  
So we could move to that. Is there any opposition 
to it? Certainly not in the region. The Arab states  
have been pressing forward for 25 years. Iran is 
strongly in favor of it. The whole global south  
is in favor of it. Europe has no objections when it 
comes up in international forums. The US vetoes it.  
Most recently, President Obama in 2015, and everyone 
knows exactly why but don't say. We can't allow  
Israel's nuclear weapons to be inspected. Sometimes 
this comes out into the open in strange ways. A  
couple of months ago the New York Times, for the 
first time ever, had an editorial saying, "Gee, why  
don't we establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in 
the middle east that would end the Iranian threat?" 
Caveat, footnote, Israel's nuclear weapons are 
non-negotiable. So the one nuclear state in  
the region can't be examined. Well is that a good 
reason to lay a basis for major threats, possible  
war, murderous sanctions, provocative actions, 
interchanges that could blow up at any time?  
I don't think so. I think if the American 
people knew about it, they wouldn't think so.  
Try to find some discussion of it. You can find it 
in arms control journals. I write about it, other  
outsiders write about it. Talking about 
questions that should be asked, that's another one.  
Front and center, very important question which 
could terminate very serious problems. So there are  
threats of nuclear war, provocative actions on 
the China border, the Russian border, development  
of new weapons. We're not alone in this. China and 
Russia are also developing dangerous new weapons.  
All of this can be brought to an end by
treaties, diplomacy, negotiation, not by provocation.
I think we have time for one more question.
So this will be the last one. How do you overcome  
the status quo bias when discussing the 
benefits of socialism versus capitalism?
Well first of all, we want to think about what 
we we mean by the word socialism. Socialism was  
a banned word in the United States until a few 
years ago. The United States is a very interesting  
country. The culture in every country in the world 
that I can think of outside of dictatorships,  
to say that I'm a socialist is like saying I'm a 
democrat. It's not even a question, you know. In fact,  
if you're a communist you can run for office. The 
United States is unique in that these words were  
outlawed. Couldn't mention them. You want to know 
something more? The word capitalism was outlawed.  
You're too young to remember. But in the 1960s, the 
main activist movement, a movement of young  
activists, was students for a democratic society, 
was the main student, the activist popular movement.  
One of the presidents of SDS, marvelous guy, Paul 
Potter, gave a presidential address, in I think  
the late 60s. In which he said, I talked about the 
problems we're facing, the war this and that. He  
said, we have to get the courage to name the system. 
We've never named the system before, and there was  
a kind of a gasp. Could he name the system? 
Actually if you look back, he couldn't say the word.  
System is capitalism, you weren't 
allowed to say that. That's too scary.  
Well the country is, now it's a little better, you 
can say the word. But what do people mean by it?  
What people mean is mostly Sanders' programs. I'm in 
favor of Sanders' programs. I've always supported  
him. I think he's a great guy. His programs 
are mild social democracy. As I said, his main  
proposals would enable him to run on the 
conservative party program in Germany.  
So what do we mean by socialism? Well and think 
about that, do we mean what it always meant in  
the past, distant past? The position of American 
workers and farmers who didn't call themselves  
socialists, never even heard of it. They just 
called themselves, actually republicans. People  
who wanted to save their republican free virtues 
as free men, even free women, which was new well.  
That was original socialism. Working people ought 
to control the enterprises in which they work.  
People ought to control their own communities. 
There shouldn't be bosses, shouldn't be  
concentrations of power. Nobody should have to rent 
themselves to survive. Well that's what socialism  
used to mean long ago. Mostly been forgotten in 
Europe too. So do we want to contrast that with  
state capitalism? I think there's a pretty good 
case for doing so, but there's a lot of barriers  
to overcome. Lots of psychological ideological 
barriers terms that are almost too scary to utter,  
like capitalism not many years ago. These are 
things to overcome, a lot of work to do everywhere.
Yeah well with that we now conclude the Q&A. 
I just want to thank all of you for joining us  
this afternoon. It was such a pleasure to hear 
from you all, and we really appreciate you  
submitting all your questions. And, of course, thank 
you professor Chomsky for giving us your  
time, and especially thank you to our sponsors the 
Agnese Nelms Haury program and ASUA. If you want  
to learn more about professor Noam Chomsky, all 
up-to-date information is on chomsky.arizona.edu.  
That is c-h-o-m-s-k-y dot a-r-i-z-o-n-a dot e-d-u. 
The recording of this Q&A will be uploaded to  
YouTube later this semester, and that link will 
be sent to you then. Again, I want to acknowledge  
and thank Sydney Mathis for helping assist me in 
this Q&A today, and thank you to all the SBS online  
ambassadors who wish you professor Chomsky the 
best. I also want to give a special shout out to  
all the administrators in the College of SBS for 
entrusting me for a second time and giving me this  
opportunity again. It was such an honor. Thank you 
again everybody and have a great evening. Thank you.  
Thank you. Good to talk to you. Gotta go out and 
take care of my dogs. They've been very polite.
