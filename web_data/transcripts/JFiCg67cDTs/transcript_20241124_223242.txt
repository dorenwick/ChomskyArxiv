it's a full house tonight uh welcome
everyone my name is archon fun and I'm
the acting dean of the Harvard Kennedy
School it's my great pleasure tonight to
welcome you to this evening's discussion
on behalf of the Kennedy School and the
Institute of politics thanks to topa
aabal aab balongan and the black men's
forum for putting this event together
we're happy tonight to be partnering
with the black men's Forum as well as
the Harvard black Students Association
and the association of Harvard black
women to co-host this
event this is a critical question
tonight that we're addressing the future
of progressive politics in America
because the what the wor left worries
about in the US are problems that are
very much with us today three of those
problems are peace social justice and
economic
equality my oldest son Alexander is 12
years old and for his whole life the
United States has been at War but living
in Cambridge Massachusetts you wouldn't
really know it a second historical
concern of the left is social justice
the challenges of social justice Are
Legion in the United States and it
perhaps these days it comes out most
clearly on the dimension of race it's a
perceptual problem and an em epistemic
problem in part differences in the ways
that black Americans and white Americans
and uh minorities perceive the reality
of everyday life and this is one reason
uh that Tod nisi coat's book has been
such a
blockbuster success because it's helped
elucidate that reality for many of us he
will be coming to The Forum uh later on
this fall it's also uh reflected in the
problem of mass incarceration as many of
you know the United States has the
highest incarceration rate in the world
in 2 one in 10 black males between the
ages of 10 and 20 was incarcerated 10
times the rate of their white peers the
chances of a black man under 35 who's a
high school dropout being involved in
the prison system in the criminal
justice system is 70%
70% right now there are 1.2 million
black children with a parent who's
incarcerated that's one in
9 a third traditional concern of the
American left has been economic
inequality inequality in the United
States as you know has been on the rise
for decades and now people in the top 1%
of the income distribution in the United
States receive more than 20 five more
than 20% of all the pre-tax income while
the bottom 90% that is 9/10 of the
population receives less than one half
of the income in the United States and
all three of these problems s threaten
American democracy in a fundamental way
and that's why I'm delighted to have our
two guests here tonight in the Forum to
help address this uh problem and some of
its these set of problems and their
political Solutions the first is Brandon
Terry a distinguished member of the
Harvard faculty and the government
Department in African-American studies
whom uh Justin will say a bit more about
in a moment I wanted to take uh just a
few uh minutes to talk about gome
Chomsky I've known gome since 1988 when
I was an undergraduate in MIT and I
asked him with a friend of mine to uh
spend an hour with us every week reading
books and he said yes and I didn't
realize then how much of an improbable
event that was or indeed how much of a
of a privilege I knew that it was a
pleasure then
um it it is certainly the case or at
least very likely the case that it were
were not for those hours discussing
political economy foreign policy and the
ways that people ought to govern elves
in society I would be a computer
scientist or an engineer right now
rather than a social scientist um what
he's put to us over his career many many
questions one question that he's
continued to put to us since his 1967
essay on the responsibility of
intellectuals is what should
intellectuals do in society he put it
this way in a reprise of that essay in
2011 in the Boston Review and he says
the question that resonates Through the
Ages in one form or another today offers
a framework for determining the
responsibility of intellectuals the
phrase is
ambiguous pay attention to this part
first does it refer to intellectuals
moral responsibilities as a decent human
beings in a position to use their
privilege and status to advance the
causes of freedom justice mercy and
peace and other such concerns that's one
possibility the second possibility is
does it refer to the role they're
expected to play in serving not derating
leadership and established institutions
so intellectuals can call out power or
they can serve established institutions
of power on the other hand those are the
two possibilities that Noom puts out now
these two possibilities put the Harvard
Kennedy School in a peculiar position
many of us as staff faculty students and
alumni seek to be intellectually honest
and critical even as we try to harness
the forces of political social and
economic power to address fundamental
concerns such as peace social justice
and economic
equality I don't know what the
resolution is however I do know that I
am deeply grateful now as ever to
Professor Chomsky for at once inspiring
many of us to carry on in this work
through the power of his own intellect
and ex his example but also for
constantly reminding us how challenging
that task is that is to fulfill the
social responsibility of
intellectuals now I'd like to hand the
stage over to Justin Porter who hails
from Murray High School in Jackson
Mississippi i' like people coming to
Harvard from the south I grew up in
Oklahoma myself he's currently a Harvard
College Junior and we owe him deep
thanks for uh co-organizing this event
Justin Where Are
You Justin Porter thank you very much
this is a dream come
true um good evening everyone my name is
Justin Porter and I am the political
action director of the Harvard black
men's Forum our organization places a
premium on thinking critically and
rigorously about the future of
progressivism and part of this is a a
matter of identity um recognizing the
different ways that various groups are
marginalized and working to reduce these
disparities both in policy and in
everyday interactions we hope that this
is only one of many future
collaborations we will be having with
the I this year um and with that being
said on behalf of our entire board I
want to introduce our incredible
moderator Professor Brandon Terry
Brandon Terry is assistant professor of
African and African-American studies and
social studies at Harvard University his
current research project sits at the
intersection of political Theory history
and African-American studies Our
extincted Guest Nome Chomsky uh no
introduction needed but is Professor
edus of linguistics and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he has
taught all of his career he is credited
with the creation of the theory of
generative grammar considered to be one
of the most significant contributions to
the field of theoretical Linguistics in
the entire 20th century Professor chsky
is also known as a radical political
activist who has been one of the most
active and most famous American
intellectuals of the left since the 60s
he is internationally renowned for his
vast writings presentations and other
broadly published work criticizing
imperialism United States foreign policy
as well as the role of media in Western
Democratic societies we are enormously
thankful to have him here sharing words
with us this evening and with that I
want to hand it off to Professor Terry
thank you
[Applause]
thank you Justin uh I also want to thank
Dean fun The Institute of politics and
the Harvard Kennedy School for hosting
us this evening the IOP Forum continues
to be one of the best spaces here at
Harvard for critical debate and dialogue
concerning issues of extraordinary
political importance and I'm happy to be
back um I also want to thank the Harvard
black men's Forum the association of
black Harvard women and the other
African-American student groups here on
campus uh when major magazines and
newspapers DEC cry the coddling of the
American mind or the lack of seriousness
and rigor that characterizes
intellectual life among college students
today it's always heartening to me that
the black student groups here are among
the folks giving lie to such judgment so
I think they should be uh applauded for
what they've been able to put together
today and inviting the great great great
gnome chsky after all it is difficult to
think of an intellectual For Whom the
word serious serious and rigor are more
aptly applied it's an honor to be here
with you this evening thank you um we're
starting a little bit late so I want to
jump right into the conversation I'll
just say we're going to open up for
questions
soon and questions have rules here okay
you got to introduce
yourself they should be short so that
other people can ask questions and
questions end with a question mark all
right we don't need your Manifesto right
now
okay you can send that by email to
Professor chsky all
right now I also want to begin with Dean
fun in 1967 that year you wrote the
responsibility of the intellectuals
which is among other things a blistering
critique of intellectual apologist for
the Vietnam War you famously wrote that
it's the responsibility of intellectuals
to speak the truth and expose lies
intellectuals you argued are in a
position to expose the lies of
government to analyze actions according
to their causes and motives and often
hidden intentions in the Western World
at least they have the power that comes
from political Liberty from access to
information and freedom of expression
for a privileged minority Western
democracy provides the Leisure the
facilities and the training to seek the
truth lying hidden behind the veil of
distortion and misrepresentation
ideology and class interest through
which the events of current history are
presented to us so firstly I want to ask
if this remains your vision of the VOC
of intellectuals and if so given our
topic power identity and the left I want
to ask what are the truths about racial
Injustice in America most in need of
telling in the wake of Ferguson in
Baltimore well just as a point of
historical accuracy that article was in
fact a talk given to a Harvard student
group oh wow and you you would you won't
guess what group it was the Harvard Hill
Foundation in
1966 the world has changed it was then
picked up and published U yeah the
vision I think Remains the Same it's not
mine it goes back to the uh origin of
intellectual
history actually the term
intellectual wasn't used in the
Contemporary sense until the late 19th
century began pretty much with the dfus
starts but you can trace it back were
people who we call we don't call them
intellectuals but they played the same
role you can go back to uh the person
who was uh who had to drink the hemlock
because he was corrupting the Youth of
Athens by asking too many questions
uh the biblical prophets who were driven
into the desert
imprisoned
maligned hundreds of years later honored
uh at the same time the pattern was set
which has persisted Through the Ages uh
the people who maybe in retrospect you
honor and respect are typically
marginalized punished tortured depending
on the nature of the society those who
are the flatterers of the Court are
honored
revered given all sorts of amenities and
grants these days and so on and that
runs virtually through history there's
very few exceptions in the case of the
dards we now honor EML Zola on the dards
but they were bitterly attacked by the
respected intellectuals of the day how
dare these writers and Poets dare to
criticize the
Magnificent French army State and so on
emola himself had to flee France
uh and it's there's very rare exceptions
to that pattern but the vision Remains
the Same the people who we call
intellectuals these days actually the
term itself is a very weird one so if uh
say a Nobel priz physicist is working in
his office all day and doing all kind of
amazing work in science but doesn't care
much about the world we don't call him
intellectual if his janitor happens to
have great ideas and understanding and
the Deep insight and plenty of knowledge
that we don't call him an intellectual
the people who are called intellectuals
are the ones who have enough privilege
and Authority deserved or not so they
can if they choose articulate their View
and who do make the choice to articulate
them on matters of public concern this
is a very strange category has nothing
particular to do with understanding
Insight knowledge and so on uh but these
the vision Remains the Same and there
are these two options that archon quoted
you can use your
privilege
your uh training your the freedom that
you that you enjoy for the purpose of uh
improving the world dealing with
problems of suffering people of
Injustice and of war and so on or you
can be a flatter at the court that's the
choice and the overwhelming majority
typically choose the latter all through
history now I'm curious as to as to you
know again so to ask this question um in
a slightly different direction so one is
you
know these truths that need to be told
in this era of Baltimore and Ferguson
like how how might we think about those
and and another thing about the
evolution of intellectuals particularly
African-American intellectuals it seems
like we're in a remarkable time uh where
in the history of African-American
intellectuals they've usually been
protest intellectuals situated outside
of the academy or outside of the halls
of privileged power and now we have a
context where you know arguably the
president himself is an African-American
intellect ual in some regards or and
it's surrounded by
um well this is where I'm
going and and and and that there's a
class of africanamerican intellectuals
who've now surrounded in this sense of
the Court um to to work alongside the
Obama Administration to pursue their
ends and so I'm curious as to you know
not only speaking of these truths what
are these truths in this moment of
Baltimore Ferguson uh but also you know
has something changed for
African-American and uals do they have
any specific responsibility given the uh
history and context of the United States
I think the responsibilities always the
same circumstances change and so as to
whether something has changed uh in the
lives of
African-Americans Ferguson
Baltimore is a kind of a cluster a
statistical clustering of things that go
on all the time I mean so it's
misleading to put them together this is
just constant I mean if you take some
constant phenomenon you're going to find
little bumps here and there where things
Cluster and it happens to be a cluster
but there's nothing new and in fact U it
goes back 400 years the first slaves
came here in about 1620 roughly it's 400
years very little has changed since
fundamentally of course the nature of
the oppression has changed dramatically
so in fact with all the research that's
been done on slavery it's really only in
the last couple of years a new
scholarship has brought out uh
understanding and materials both about
the character of the slave labor camps
which were incomparably worse than even
had been assumed or anything else in
history and also strikingly their huge
contribution to the uh modern economic
development in the United States in
England and much of Europe uh it's by
now becoming clear was kind of somewhat
understood but much more is come is
becoming understood of the enormous
contribution this made to every aspect
of the economy for well over a century
uh the early Industrial Revolution was
based on Cotton that been known for a
long time but that includes uh
manufacturing biggest manufacturing
Industries say l were textile
manufacturer a lot of secondary effects
from that uh commerce was heavily based
on textiles cotton production and so on
the financial institutions developed the
first Britain you know Barclay's bank
and so on then here uh in dealing with
the textile industries in England uh the
Manu was same thing they were living off
of make slave labor camps in the United
States for a long time and these camps
were just unbelievable the new research
that's coming out is pretty shocking so
for example it turns out this was not
known until a couple of years ago that
the productivity in the slave labor
camps Rose very rapid rapidly even more
rapidly than an industry with no
technology except for the bull whip and
the pistol just driving people harder
and harder making their lives more and
more miserable and impossible and of
course as you all know that didn't end
with the Civil War there were a few
years of formal Freedom when a lot of
interesting things happened then came
the north south compact which simply
reinstituted slavery
in another form uh much like today in
criminalizing Black life uh so the black
especially the black male population
straight back to jail for you know
vagrancy or whatever it might be and
pretty soon you had a perfect slave
labor force the manufacturers and the
mine owners didn't even have to sustain
their working for class the work like a
plantation owner had to make sure that
the slaves ate but when they're in
prison you don't have to bother with
that the Public's doing it and a good
deal of the uh American Industrial
Revolution in the late 19th early 20th
century was based on slave labor and
prisons and we're familiar with the
chain gangs because you know it's kind
of an image but same was true of us
steel mining whole huge system went up
almost up to the second world war when
there was a need for
what's called Free Labor actually I
remember as a child my
parents had jobs they were the only ones
in the family they were teachers so we
had you know small income but every
family who had an income had a maid and
the maid was a black maid until 1939
when they went into
the manufacturing so you know my mother
had to learn how to cook
that's this one of the things that
talked about it comes right up to the
present nothing's Jang this is one of
the things we've talked a lot about in
my course um on African-American
political thought these these uh Notions
of domination slavery is a form of
domination and the different practices
that are uh constitutive of that
domination and how they out they have an
afterlife From Slavery and are
reconstituted in so-called free labor
and other relations and some of this
great work on uh slavery and capitalism
is being done right here by folks like
Sven beckard and Walter Johnson right um
I guess I you know there's
um you know this this idea of um you
know nothing changing right that that
that well that that the forms of
Oppression reconstitute themselves into
different iterations of white supremacy
and and just as they reconstitute
themselves so do the forms of resistance
and one of the things that's most
grabbed the
imagination of the public today is the
black lives matter movement and while
has been met with enthusiasm in in some
Corners uh you know there's even some
concern among fellow Travelers on the
left that the black lives matter
movement uh is evolving in problematic
directions and I was sort of curious as
to how you might respond to critics who
say that you know they shouldn't take up
tactics like interrupting a presumed
sympathizer Like Bernie Sanders or that
they focus too narrowly on police
brutality instead of a broader social
justice agenda or that EMP izing race
right this debate about whether black
lives matter or all lives matter should
be the rhetorical uh guesture is
ultimately divisive um so these all
speak to a worry that Progressive
politics is now unmowed from a kind of
leftist foundation and it lacks any
clear unifying um basis and so I was
wondering given your history and your
experience with these enduring debates
about race in the left uh all the way
back to the new left and black power era
how would you respond to these kinds of
criticisms about black lives matter
which about the movement well take say
all lives matter I mean that kind of
critique can be made against
anything suppose you're opposed to the
Iraq war or you know uh the minimum wage
pick whatever you like it always
generalizes to everything why not why
this not everything else and there is
something quite unique about black
history I mean not actually it's not
totally there's another thing that we
don't see very much but the country was
founded remember on two major crimes
huge crimes the first is it's a setar
colonial society that's a particularly
ugly and destructive form of imperialism
it means you don't just rule over the
native people you eliminate them so they
are still around you know often Corners
here and there but they sit we may not
see them every day walking around the
streets but their situation is pretty
much like blacks and that's the second
major crime of course the two huge
crimes of expulsion and
extermination and uh in slavery which uh
which essentially created the economy uh
they have reverberations right to the
present and that affects the tactics
that are used in both groups and gives
them a reason to uh focus on what is a
unique form of repression uh
that's you can say the same about you
know
say Jews under Nazi Germany had a good
reason to focus on Jewish issues and
um with regard to particular tactics you
know I don't know you can debate I think
takes a interrupting Bernie Sanders I
personally didn't like it but it had a
point and in fact it ended not badly it
ended with a uh discussion debate
interchange and some
reconciliation so turned out not to be
too bad I would say I mean I'm very
reluctant to criticize tactics because
my own tactical judgment is pretty
pretty bad I'm usually
wrong things that I thought shouldn't
have been done turned out very well so
take say occupy if anybody had asked me
would it make sense to sit in zucati
park for a couple of weeks I would have
said you're out of your mind but it
turned out very well
and seems true many times so tactical
Jud tactical judgments are not trivial
you know they're important you have to
consider what the likely consequences
are but it's a it's a subtle judgment
and there's I don't have much to say
about it
in this particular case I didn't think
it turned out
badly it's interesting because I mean I
did want to talk about Bernie Sanders so
it would be good to to to go to that
this
um you know there's this question that
constantly comes up about you know race
and the left right and that Sanders
seemed particularly vulnerable to the
criticism in so far as he identified as
a Democratic Socialist and he had this
this uh uh uh political platform this
philosophy this rhetoric that focused
almost exclusively on the question of
wealth
inequality uh income inequality and the
kinds of power and leverage that the
billionaire class and other Elites have
on disrupting the functioning of
democratic government or the the kinds
of uh political participation available
to to the citizen R and what's
remarkable is that you know in his mind
and he's correct on this that any of the
implications he had he's you know of his
programs would be uh you know remarkably
beneficial if you accept certain
principles of the left for
African-Americans but many people don't
see it that way they don't they don't
respond necessarily to those kinds of
ways of framing the argument they don't
respond to the that method of putting uh
together a platform and what was
shocking to me is that it seemed that in
a Democratic primary even an Insurgent
campaign looking to wield power over the
eventual nominee that the Sanders
campaign hadn't really thought about how
to recruit people of color to their
campaign until very late and I I was
curious as to as to why you thought that
would be the case how could he miss
something uh that that seems so
glaringly obvious uh to to a scholar
like me actually I met uh Bernie Sanders
about 30 years ago and U spent some time
with him and I respect him I think he's
doing very good good things but just
take a look at his career uh he was uh a
mayor of an uh in burlingon Vermont uh
representative in
Vermont uh how much contact did he have
with the problems of black
reg in fact I I think this should there
are other policies of his that I mean I
like him and I think he's having a very
positive effect but if you run through
the policies there's other policies
I don't like like for example his gun
policies which also reflect Vermont u a
lot of his the foreign policy issues I
don't agree with him about uh but he's
uh I think he's making a very positive
contribution he's doing something
courageous important he's lit a spark
it's important effect and I think the uh
pressure from the black community
including disruption of the speeches did
shift this campaign it brought up issues
that yes they would have continued to
ignore and U you can debate whether this
is the best tactic or you know discuss
it but uh as I said before I think the
general impact was
positive now some people are trying to
connect the surprising uh success of his
campaign so far you know he's out
pulling Hillary Clinton in Iowa and
Vermont and he's pulling nationally much
higher than almost anyone expected
certainly much higher than Martin Ali
expected
um sorry I got a D I'm from Baltimore
um uh but but some people are describing
the kinds of energies that are going
into the Sanders campaign as part of a
global phenomenon right so that we have
Jeremy Corbin in the UK uh another
self-described socialist who's now uh
the head of the labor party in Britain
uh and in Greece which has been burdened
so traumatically by austerity policy uh
we have uh Alexis cus of the leftwing ca
party uh who's been elected prime
minister and I was curious as to what
you thought was the you know if
something is shared Behind these uh
these candidacies if something uh more
Universal is driving the kind of
enthusiasm for the left in this moment
um not just this moment yeah there's
something very common it's called
neoliberalism This is a general assault
on the world's
population uh that takes different forms
in different places but is based on the
same kinds of
conceptions uh and it's people have
suffered everywhere every place that the
neoliberal principles have been applied
it's been harmful to the general
populations uh in the United States
which is not harmed as much as others
You Know Rich powerful Society uh
there's been basically stagnation or
decline for about 30 years for a
majority of the population I people are
now arguing about the minimum wage but
if you take a look at the minimum wage I
presume you know this through the huge
growth period 50s and 60s uh it tracked
productivity that started to break the
late 70s when the neoliberal assault
began uh if the minimum wage had
continued to do so it would now probably
be about $20 an hour so when people are
talking about $15 an hour they're saying
let's keep it low uh and that holds for
everything uh uh real male wages are now
roughly what they were in the late 60s
uh the figures just came out a couple
days ago about U median household
incomes they're now lower than they were
seven or eight years ago uh and it's
been prettyy
at ever since you know the Reagan
Thatcher
neoliberal assault and the same is it's
taking a different form in Europe a
worse form in many ways Greece Spain
England have been targeted by uh very
reactionary economic policies even worse
than here these the idea of austerity
during recession even the IMF thinks
it's ridiculous and from an economic
point of view yes sure it's an absurdity
but that doesn't mean it's it's it's
foolish it's a very good instrument of
class war it's uh undermining
U social it's undermining the major
achievements of Europe since the second
world war both political and social and
economic what we call you know welfare
state program programs are being
significantly undermined England as well
uh and uh from the point of view of the
people designing the policy sure they
never like these things let's get rid of
them and the same is happening almost
everywhere I mean in England it's it's
almost startling to see for example
England uh the National Health Service
has its flaws like everything it's
probably one of the best health systems
in the world they're now trying to make
it like the American system which is
maybe the worst system in the world uh
literally about twice the per capita
costs of other countries and some of the
worst
outcomes extensive bureaucracy
inefficiency uh uh enormous costs poor
outcomes so let's become like them and
destroy a successful system the same is
happening in Canada these are just
different manifestations of the
neoliberal programs and the resistance
is not just starting now the major
resistance started in Latin America
about 10 or 15 years ago uh the lat
Latin America was a very loyal student
of the neoliberal doctrines and of
course suffered significantly but about
10 or 15 years ago they started to pull
out of it uh both economically and
politically uh in fact uh
one of Obama's supposed foreign policy
achievements is uh the beginning of
normalization of relations with Cuba the
way it's described here uh Obama made
this forthcoming Noble gesture to bring
Cuba out of its isolation it's exactly
the opposite the United States was
utterly isolated in the
hemisphere the last major hemispheric
conference happened to be in
Columbia the last us Ally the US is
practically thrown out of the hemisphere
on this issue and on the drug war two
major issues uh they couldn't reach a
consensus because the US and Canada
wouldn't agree the next hemisphere
conference was going to be in Panama
this year and if the United States had
not made some move on Cuba it probably
would have been thrown out of the
hemisphere for anyone who knows the
history of the United States and the
Western Hemisphere that's utterly
shocking this was the backyard when
didn't worry about it they do what you
tell them if they don't you overthrow
the government you know it's totally
reversed and this is a this began as a
reaction to the neoliberal policies
which they have slowly begun to pull
themselves out of it's now spread to
southern Europe there other uh other
manifestations here so you're right
there's something Global takes different
forms in different places but it's uh
that has commonalities as well I think
one of the things that's um part and
partial of the neoliberal project or the
at least the effect of the neoliberal
project the
dislocations uh that have happened with
people uh you know we're seeing record
uh numbers of people seeking Asylum
migrants at border conflicts uh and so I
before I open up for questions I I
wanted to get your thoughts on
um not not simply those problems but a
kind of I I heard you backstage
dismissed the description of populism so
I'd be curious as to what exactly you
call it but the nativist and uh I think
quite frankly racist in some respects uh
response to migration that we're seeing
drive a lot of right-wing politics in
the world West uh at at the moment that
is also capturing the imagination of
workingclass people in our country of
course with Donald Trump uh and Ben
Carson who just said to um you know
major media outlet that he thinks that
there's no way anyone uh who practices
Islam should ever be the president he
just thought that that was an okay thing
to say
um uh so I'm curious as to as to how do
you contextualize that nativist
right-wing uh if not populist I'd be
curious of how you describe it
response well there there are
differences between the United States
and Europe you take a look at American
history it's a society of
immigrants uh the N indigenous
population was
destroyed pretty Advanced
civilizations destroyed eliminated the
people exterminated you had to fill the
continent with people so you had
immigrants but the racism goes right
back to the beginning
uh take say Benjamin Franklin uh you
know one of the most enlightened figures
in the in the world at the time a leader
of the Enlightenment he had views on
immigration he thought that Germans and
swedes should be excluded because they
are too
sthy literally Germans and swedes uh
there's a myth of anglosaxon ism that
goes right through American history
right into the 20th century people are
coming from all over the place but they
when they work their way into the
society they become Anglo Saxons uh
Thomas Jefferson when he founded the
University of Virginia that was to keep
Southern gentlemen from being distorted
by Harvard you know but one of the it
was a law school and U they had to study
Anglo Saxon law because that's our Roots
you know we're Anglo-Saxons
uh and U as it goes through take say the
Irish when the Irish came to Boston uh
they were treated pretty much like
blacks you could see restaurants saying
you know no dogs in Irish and that sort
of thing in fact uh some of it's really
pretty hideous if you take a look at the
history of Gynecology a lot of it was
developed at Harvard Medical School and
they needed subjects so who are the
subjects
well you know people who can be subjects
like black women and Irish women you can
try out the techniques uh by sooner or
later the Irish worked themselves into
the society they became you know the
policeman the bureaucrats the the
president and so on and so forth but and
then they become Anglo-Saxons and you
want to keep out the others uh the
United States needed immigrants right
through the 19th century and apart from
Oriental exclusion which was blocked it
was open until
1924 and at that point IM the first
major immigration law was aimed at
Italians and
Jews uh and with that you get nativism
we don't want anymore uh we have what we
got we don't want anym nobody else
should have it uh and if you take a look
at the and it's not that the immigrants
want to come here they would like to
stay in their own countries in fact if
you take the Middle East the massive
immig of refugees are staying right
there there are countries that are
absorbing huge numbers of refugees I
mean in Lebanon small country probably a
quarter of the population are refugees
uh Iran has absorbed refugees Jordan's
absorbing them Syria was absorbing them
until it started them
self-destruct uh there are countries
that absorb refugees there are countries
that generate refugees like us now
people are fleeing from Iraq the Iraq
war created maybe two million refugees
and they're still fleeing fleeing from
Afghanistan so there are countries that
absorb them there are countries that
generate them there are countries that
generate them and refuse to absorb them
like us for example uh and and it's you
know now we're magnanimously taking in
what 5,000 syrians or something but uh a
lot of these are the result of kind of a
sledgehammer hitting the region in the
Iraq War which uh incited sectarian
conflicts that are now tearing the whole
region apart or take say South of the
Border if you've looked at the
statistics when there was a so-called
Refugee crisis immigration crisis year
ago or so the the largest number were
coming from
Honduras why Honduras it's a poor
country but it was also hit by a a
sledgehammer the government was
overthrown the democratic government by
a military coup about the only country
who supported it was the United States
indirectly but supported it and it
turned into a monstrosity and people are
fleeing as soon as first we create the
situation
in which they can't survive in their own
country then when they flee we put them
into they I don't know it's pretty awful
by the border if they make it through
the border and they don't get killed
they're stuck into trucks and sent back
as if it was a concentration camp and
dumped across the border to uh the you
know to somehow take care of themselves
if they can't and now we build you know
going to build a wall and so on as
the N but the you can understand
the the the I mean for people who are
being under duress and working people in
the United States have had a pretty
rotten time for 30 years or more the
generation it's easy to try to find uh a
reason that isn't the true reason but
that's kind of on the
surface seems to make intuitive sense
they're taking our job in fact they're
not they're taking jobs that nobody
wants to take and they increase the uh
economic level of the so places where
they are but that's subtle what you see
is they're working and I'm not okay must
be their fault and it's pretty easy for
uh uh you know political figures races
demagogues the Trump types to turn this
into something that looks plausible in
Europe it's even worse I mean I've
always felt all my life in fact that
Europe is probably more racist than the
United States it doesn't show up as much
in Europe because the societies tended
to be
homogeneous so when everybody's blonde
and blue-eyed you can say oh we're not
racists you know we love everybody but
as soon as you get a tiny percentage of
the population that
deviates then all of a sudden uh uh it
all comes out in extremely ugly ways my
personal experiences there have all been
a level of intense interpersonal racism
that I've never experienced in the
United States I do want to make sure we
get a chance for questions if everyone
could line up at microphones I know um
there are many many questions remember
introduce yourself uh please keep your
question short and questions end with a
question
mark all right brother you're first good
evening Professor Chomsky thank you for
your distinguished visit to us my name
is Junius Williams I'm a sophomore here
at the college you very compellingly and
vividly recount the history of slavery
and the legacies that it has on the
African-American community in the United
States would you then support a system
of reparations Financial or otherwise
paid to the African-American community
and why or why not thank you would I
very much so not just
African-Americans uh the those who are
uh you know we ourselves didn't own
slaves but we me are rich and privileged
because of the torture of black of
blacks for centuries and yes we owe them
reparations same with the remnants of
the Native Americans same with countries
that we've destroyed take what about
Iraq I mean we've devastated Iraq uh
it's uh killed hundreds of thousands of
people generated millions of
refugees uh created a sectarian conflict
that's destroying the place is it our
responsibility sure who responsibility
is it so yes I think the call for
reparations is very legitimate take say
Europe and
Africa people are fleeing from Africa to
Europe not the other way around is there
reason for that yeah couple of centuries
of murderers brutal
colonialism so sure they ow reparations
not just take in the refugees uh but do
something about it in fact create
conditions in their own Societies in
which there won't be
refugees that's the real answer to the
so-called Refugee problem but it
requires those who have uh been wielding
the whip to say okay we benefited from
it s responsibility we'll do something
about
it sister right
here oh okay there we go hi I'm Salange
I'm a sophomore at the college as well
um so my question kind of sent arounds
this recent increase in more online
progressivism um a lot of hashtag
movements and social media campaigns and
I just wanted to know how you think this
ties into intellectualism um and
progressivism and if it contributes or
takes away from the
conversation yeah could you repeat yeah
so the question was um there's been a
transformation in social media
Technologies online technologies that
have changed a lot of progressive
activism and intellectual life and do
you think that these changes enable more
profound conversation or in some ways
limited is that the social media
phenomenon yeah social media Twitter um
those kind of digital
publics I think like most technology
it's kind of of neutral depends how you
use it so it can I mean social media are
in fact used for organization organizing
activities that's good on the other hand
I don't know about you but when I walk
around campus and see everybody holding
an iPhone and having a superficial
conversation with somebody in India or
whatever it is I I don't think it's a
good thing I think there's a it it can
it's a very atomized Society that's one
of its real problems uh and in fact the
neoliberalism tends to create
atomization in fact that's part of the
basic ideology you're in it for
yourself other people can fend for
themselves but I'm for me that's
so-called Market ideology and the social
media have a tendency to magnify that
they they don't have to but they do I
think so it's a as I say like most
technology you can use it uh in a
constructive effective way or it can be
used
to diminish the character of life it's
your choice and you can quote tweet it
with the hashtag Chomsky
night at the Kennedy
School uh right up here a sister right
here hi my name is nansy and I'm a
junior joint concent in history and
Jewish studies uh there's a term amongst
the very small milu of uh very liberal
Jews called pep which is Progressive
except for Palestine um this refers to a
special relationship that we have to
admit exists between America and Israel
that we can trace at least but probably
farther at least back to 1967 at which
point the American Jewish Community
played a huge role in the Civil Rights
Movement um but then began to have some
tensions and tensions and disagreements
when the Black American community and
the Jewish American community disagreed
over um The Six Day War uh in ' 67 um
and we can kind of Follow that up to
today when we have figures like Sheldon
adelen who will determine our Republican
candidate in the primary um also
donating $40 million to Endeavors such
as Birthright ironically got get
question sorry my question is um will
progress in the Progressive American
Community require a reckoning um with a
right a a an Israel that is becoming
more right-wing
um or is that an issue that we can
somehow exis from the issue of domestic
uh Progressive
politics did you um
so sorry so the the the question the
question part was uh how should
progressivism uh deal with uh an
increasingly right-wing Israel um is
this an is this an issue that will
inevitably cause challenges for the
solidarities needed to forge in American
progressivism or is there some way for
American progressives to kind of Sid
step that question and Achieve other
aims well in my I mean I've been
involved in this all my life since the
1930s so it's a big issue for me but
what has happened if if you take a look
at
what's happening with Israel and Israel
in the world it's pretty dramatic if you
go back say 40 years uh Israel was one
of the most admired countries in the
world today it's uh one of the most
disliked the feared hated countries in
the world and what's happened what's
happened was perfectly
predictable I don't say that in
retrospect I was writing about it in the
early 70s completely predictable uh
Israel was after the 67 War which you
mentioned uh was
uh in a position where it could take
several
choices one and the choices were Stark
and clear in
1971 uh Egypt the major country in the
region the only military force outside
of Israel Egypt offered Israel a full
peace treaty full peace treaty no
problems with one condition withdraw
from Egyptian territory actually they
said Palestinian territory but they
meant uh Arab territory but they meant
Egyptian territory the sin that was
considered by the Israel cabinet they
rejected it uh they wanted to expand
into the sin and ever since then Israel
has been facing a choice between
expansion or security and its selected
expansion that's happening right to the
moment and we're responsible in know in
large measure for that it's largely
because of the unique unilateral us
rejectionism that this
continues the US is standing virtually
alone and has for years in preventing a
diplomatic settlement it's happening
right almost to the
present the LA the a lot of it is vetos
of Security Council resolutions it's not
all the most recent recent one was by
President Obama who went so far as to
veto a resolution calling for official
US
policy official US policy is there
should be no settlement expansion
actually that's a pretty small issue the
issue is the settlements not their
expansion but the uh the official policy
is they shouldn't expand that was the UN
resolution Obama V to it in fact there
was a much more significant case just a
couple of weeks ago couple of months ago
uh the every five years there's a
review um Conference of the
nonproliferation treaty that's the most
important Arms Treaty in the world if
that breaks down we can kiss each other
goodbye it's putting some break not a
enough of a break but some break on the
development of means of Destruction
which will obliterate us very quickly
the nonproliferation treaty is actually
conditioned on an agreement 20 years ago
that uh there will be steps towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle
East it was because of formal acceptance
of that condition that the
nonproliferation treaty was able to be
extended comes up every five years at
the review conference the US blocks it
Obama just did a couple of months ago
the last meeting and of course it's
always the same reason to protect
Israel's nuclear weapons so this us
rejectionism is not only maintaining
severe instability in the region and in
my view is harming Israel severely but
it's also may break down the
nonproliferation treaty and open the way
to uh further expansion of this you know
curse that will destroy us it's kind of
ironic in the context of all the flurry
about Iranian nuclear programs Iran is
in the lead in trying to establish a
nuclear weapons free zone they're
calling for it
constantly their foreign minister just
repeated it again he said okay we made
this nuclear deal now let's go on and
and bring and uh take a real step
forward make this one of the regions
free of nuclear weapons in fact all
weapons of mass destruction us blocked
it and uh the media cooperated by not
barely even reporting it practically not
at all well these are things that are
happening all the time we have a
significant share of responsibility all
of us we can influence policy
it's it'll go on like this unless we do
uh and for Israel it's having exactly
the consequences you describe it's
becoming a very right-wing very racist
very oppressive all predictable from the
choice 40 years ago to choose expansion
over uh
security uh I think we're basically out
of time we but we can do one more right
here hi uh my name is Taha I'm a Syrian
physician affiliated with HMS and I'm
sorry I'm holding an iPhone um I have a
twofold question related to Syria so
first uh would you uh describe the
recent Russian deployment in Syria as
imperialistic and uh how do you explain
the lift uh whether in the US or Europe
not standing against uh against that
kind of behavior and the second question
is it's my understanding and please
correct me if I'm wrong that you against
the US launching air strikes against
Bashar Assad after the chemical weapon
attack in
2013 do you think the West has a moral
responsibility in any scenario to
actually use Force to stop Mass scale
murder uh perpetrated by uh like dict
dictator dictatorships anywhere in the
world thank
you I don't hear very well so uh there
were two questions one is should we
understand uh the Russian intervention
in Syria as an act of imperialism and
the second is
um referencing uh critique you made of
um of the US uh the US intervention or
or or the possibility of us intervention
in Syria with the use of chemical
weapons and the question is is there is
there any condition in which you would
justify uh us humanitarian intervention
to prevent Mass Slaughter or chemical
weapons deployment is that fair thanks
not just us um you can ask the question
uh when is humanitarian intervention
Justified and there's a prior question
does the category
exist is there such a thing as
humanitarian intervention actually
that's not an idle question if you look
over modern history what you discover is
just about every use of for
is called humanitarian
intervention literally we're doing it
for Noble purposes but then you always
have to ask the question is it true and
the answer to that is almost always no
uh inter I wouldn't say 100% but
overwhelmingly intervention is for the
purposes for the interests of those who
are carrying out the force so is it uh
would it be uh a legitimate thing
yeah it would if it existed but the
question is does it exist so take say
Libya that was called humanitarian
intervention uh the US Britain and
France decided to violate the security
Council resolution that they had uh
rammed through uh and became the air
force of the rebels and ended up
destroying the country it's a Horror
Story it's in fact one of the things
that's contributing to the atrocities in
Libya as arms and jihadis and so on are
flowing out through there all right so
let's take us policy in Syria or or
Russian policy Russia is supporting a
brutal vicious government you can I
don't think they should but it's not
imperialism to support a government is
not imperialism maybe completely wrong
but it's not imperialism what's the us
doing the US is supporting the countries
that
are developing the Jihadi movement the
main source of the
uh Islam radical islamist movements is
Saudi Arabia our main Ally not only with
funding but also with h the Messianic
Zeal with which they use their oil
resources to promulgate uh radical the
most extreme version of radical
fundamentalist Islam so and uh Patrick
Coburn one of the main most serious
commentators on the region I think
correctly describes the what he calls
the wahhab isation of Sunni Islam coming
from Saudi Arabia primarily as one of
the most dangerous developments of the
era the one offshoot of it is the
so-called Islamic State but if you look
at say the al-nusra front which is the
al-Qaeda
Affiliated Jihadi force in Syria it's
about the same they're fighting a Turf
battle but their ideology and goals are
very similar who's supporting the
al-nusra front our Ally turkey our NATO
Ally turkey are the main supporters of
the elus ref front in fact that support
is so strong that you recall a couple of
weeks ago
the Pentagon sent in a group of what are
called moderate Fighters around 50
people who they had trained for years at
the cost of you know half a billion
dollars within a few days they were
either killed captured or
defected uh to the alnus front
apparently with the aid of Turkish
intelligence so our main Ally Saudi
Arabia has been the source of what
became the Islamic State uh our other
main Ally turkey is supporting a
comparable group the al-Qaeda Affiliated
NRA front uh Russia is supporting Assad
also comparably brutal and destructive
how do you
intervene can you think of some no I
don't think you should ignore it uh you
can't the idea that military
intervention would help it is very
dubious I don't think anyone who's
really familiar with Syria at least no
one I know of has been in favor of
military intervention be who knows about
s well exactly who would you attack if
you attack Assad you're undermining the
resistance to the Islamic State in alra
who will then take over is that what you
want for Syria no that they didn't exist
in 2013 at the chemical open the sources
existed The Roots yeah but if you go
back to 2012 there was no Uprising so
sure by 2013 the beginnings were
starting but everybody who was watching
it could see these groups develop
pouring in from the outside they have
roots in the Sunni Community uh which
sees itself as under attack and you if
you could find you know the so-called
moderate forces if you could find them I
mean they're nice people I met many of
them in Lebanon at the time and I'd be
happy if they could take over but it
just doesn't look like a possibility
when a military conf when a forceful
conflict
develops there's a dynamic that's almost
Universal the most brutal elements move
to the
front the ones who are really vicious
brutal and murderous they take over
everybody else put to the side happens
over and over as soon as the conflict in
Syria was militarized you could see it
beginning it would be nice if things
worked out differently but they don't
and you're now in a situation where you
have a group of forces all of whom are
totally
unpalatable some of them being supported
by the Russians some of them being
supported by the US allies main us
allies and the and just what form
military intervention could take in
these circumstances
is nobody to my mind has given a
possible scenario that makes any sense
there is something that could be done
one thing slim possibility but it's the
only hope and that's the kind of uh
settlement that's a lakar brahimi was
trying to
negotiate some kind of negotiated
settlement it would have to involve a
transitional government and like it or
not the Assad regime will have to be
part of it if the Assad regime is not
permitted to be part of it they'll fight
to the death certainly they're not going
to say okay we commit suicide so awful
as they are they're going to have to be
part of it just as uh the leaders of the
aparte regime in South Africa had to be
part of a settlement
uh the United States and its allies have
refused to allow it to be part of the
settlement that guarantees that there'll
be no
negotiations uh the Russian the Russian
position has been they must be part of
the settlement and may that they must
stay well if that happens it's not going
to be a there's not going to be a
negotiated settlement there was actually
you've probably read if you read the
European press you will know that a
couple of days ago maybe a week ago
there were uh The Finnish Ambassador who
was high who basically running the
negotiations had an interview in which
he claimed that uh in
2012 the Russians had offered to have a
uh negotiated settlement in which Assad
would step down that's was refuted well
that's what he said uh that's reported
by all the press in England by the
European press has yet to be reported in
the print press in the United States
there a few online reports which sort of
dismiss it and say it wasn't serious we
don't know whether it was serious or not
the only way to find out whether
proposal is serious is to pursue it and
apparently was dismissed so maybe it was
serious maybe it wasn't uh but if
there's any alternative to that I don't
know what
well I want to thank Professor Chomsky
for his erudition and his Insight on all
of these issues I hope that we continue
these conversations about identity power
and the left I want to thank the Harvard
black men's Forum the Harvard
Association of black women uh for all of
their support in bringing this together
and The Institute of politics for
hosting us this evening and I'd like
everybody to give another round of
applause for Professor Chomps
thank you so much
[Applause]
