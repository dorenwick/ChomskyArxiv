[Applause]
well good evening everybody thank you
for making us feel welcome uh this is a
wonderful occasion to have uh Professor
chsky n chsky who of course you all know
something about uh a distinguished
colleague from MIT who is also um a
leading scholar in linguistics and of
course uh probably uh there's no public
intellectual in the world who's has the
the stature of of N chsky and I feel
very fortunate to have been a student of
his decades ago he probably doesn't
remember that we used to take the tea
from here to hear you and Jerry foder
teach in the in the 60s and then uh I
have known Bruno for much less a period
of time but uh a wonderful colleague
scholar Diplomat science fiction writer
or science editor science editor uh sort
off yeah worked for many years at oecd
got them interested in uh Neuroscience
brain uh study of of language and
culture and for the last several years
has been a visiting teacher here um both
teaching courses and also here in J Term
and no matter how late I go home at
night and I go home pretty late uh if I
had to bet who's going to be sitting
outside of Larsen Hall chatting with
students it'll be it'll be it'll be
Bruno uh and so it's great to have both
both of them here we're trying to figure
out the origin of this evening and we
none of us were successful in in doing
it um but I think you all know that
we're here um The Catalyst for the for
the evening is was the publication um I
guess in Portuguese 45 years ago of a
book that had a lot of influence of
pedagogy of the oppressed by a man whose
name I am not used to pronouncing and
I've taken lots of polls and you'll hear
it pronounced lots of ways tonight but
it's roughly speaking Pao FR um thank
you um and I want to start by uh asking
the audience just to describe yourselves
how many people here know the three
choices will be uh know little or
nothing about frir um know enough so you
could write a paragraph you know the
first paragraph of Wikipedia and some of
who how how many of you are really quite
familiar with his writings with critical
theory um so this is for you a this is
not an introduction it's a coming home
so how many of you uh know little or
nothing about it so there would be an
introduction you're the only ones I'm
not going to get called on by the way
raise raise your hands higher though
okay so it's about 14%
um how many how many of you could write
a paragraph and okay so I'm with uh most
you um we know something but but not a
lot um and how many of you are really
quite familiar with his work and
writings uh so it's it's a it's a small
number so I think that's helpful for us
to do so we tend to go till around seven
and there will be time for questions
from the audience I'm a very strict
Taskmaster when it comes to questions so
they they can be a little bit long more
longer than a tweet um but you might
actually if you want to ask a question
you might want to write it down because
that helps you to be be succinct um we
will Begin by talking about um how uh
gnome and Bruno first encountered F's
writings whether they had some personal
contact with him um what they thought at
the time how they've seen his influence
wax and Wayne over the years um and I
will then introduce um exhibit a which I
only discovered when I was phoning up
for this which is an amazing two pages
out of the frir reader about the Harvard
grad school of education how many of you
know that on pages four and five of this
book The Ed school gets
excoriated
well uh then we'll move into more
General discussions of educational
Trends about which um you know both of
the both of the people in the stage you
know have observed over the decades and
where we are at this point in
educational thinking and educational
practice around the world um we may look
a bit forward in both a dystopian and a
utopian way about what might happen and
these are things of course that people
who study or work here talk and think
about all the time but we don't always
have a chance to hear from people with
conspectus that uh gnome and Bruno have
um and uh we may talk a bit about other
things though we agreed that we're not
going to discuss uh 911 or
the you know the the most recent
elections um that's this is for this is
for this is for another day today is is
F's day and and education and the
reasons for the current Trend so are you
guys okay with this sure okay um so Nome
you
actually uh mentioned when you first
read the book can you talk a bit about
your first contact with F's um writings
well he was actually here though I
didn't know it it was one the English I
don't know whether is your is this
working let me see it may be sort of
working but uh let me see maybe if it's
green should be working okay I'm going
to have to listen carefully just doesn't
like to be in my
pocket uh he actually was here at the
time though I didn't know it uh when the
English edition of his book came out
which was
1972 I read it I already knew about his
work I hadn't read the Portuguese
Edition but uh knew I was very much
interested and involved in fact in the
background out of which it grew remember
the book came the original book came out
in
1968 and uh rather interestingly by the
time it came out in England 72 the
situation had substantially changed over
over that fouryear period uh 1968 as I'm
sure you all know was a pretty exciting
year around much of the world um United
States as well uh and uh in Latin
America particularly and in Brazil even
more particularly actually frer had
already been exiled from Brazil uh so in
fact his book couldn't appear there for
years many years the
dictatorship had repressed
the dictatorship incidentally was
strongly backed by the United States it
was apparently planned in the last the
coup in the last days of the Kennedy
administration took place right
afterwards that was it was a a vicious
brutal dictatorship the first of a
series of kind of Neo-Nazi style
National Security states that spread
through the hemisphere it
reached horrible Peak in the 1980s with
the massive atrocities in Central
America this was the first major one uh
it was called the the greatest uh
victory for freedom in the 20th century
by uh Lincoln Gordon Kennedy Johnson
Ambassador Brazil they were College
president and that was typical the
reaction it was very brutal uh and the
one aspect of it was uh f
Exile and there was more than that one
of the leading figures in what was
called Liberation theology it was the
progressive part of the Catholic Church
actually it's called that but the term
is kind of strange I would have thought
it should be called the conservative
part of the Catholic church and it was
dedicated to bringing the gospels back
into
Christianity they had been kicked out of
Christianity in the fourth century when
the Roman
Empire Emperor took over the church and
uh made it the religion of imperialism
and
oppression first couple of centuries
Catholic Christians not Catholics in
were
persecuted the cross which was the
symbol of the suffering of the poor was
placed by the emperor on the shield of
the Roman Legions
early 4th century and stayed pretty much
like that the great Theologian and
historian of Christianity Hans Kung uh
describes this shift in the 4th Century
as the shift from the church of the
persecuted to the Church of the
persecutors and he himself describes in
his history of Christianity Vatican 2
which took place in 1962 when that's the
background for F's work he describes
that as the moment when the church
returned from the church of the
persecute persecutors to the Church of
the
persecutor uh it adopted tried is
persecuted the same word as oppressed
because I'm wondering whether that's
basically the same yeah same as
oppressed uh it's uh and that's fa ter
he's right in the middle of this uh and
Brazil was right in the center the
Brazilian Bishops were the main
Force pressuring for the radical shift
in the church that took place in 1962
under po John the
23rd uh and that initiated what came to
be called Liberation theology which was
dedicated to the gospel's principle of
uh what's called preferential option for
the poor it had a lot of effect uh the
biggest effect in fact was in
1968 when fer wrote it was a a Bishop's
conference conference of the Latin
American Bishops which formerly adopted
the fundamental principles of Liberation
theology preferential option for the
poor uh the leading one of the leading
figures was the bishop of the afar's
Native City
rifi uh them held Comm I was called the
bishop of the
poor they were doing things similar to
and sometimes borrowing from the
pedagogy of the press that he developed
there were uh priests nuns lay people
over going into the villages out the
countryside organizing what we're called
base
communities where um people were reading
the gospel Els not just reciting them
you know like you do one Sunday morning
without thinking but actually reading
them uh thinking about what they said
and as I said it's radical
pacifist uh and
uh trying to establish this concept of
conscientization that F
emphasizes raise
Consciousness understand your own
oppression recognize that you don't have
to be passive and oppressed it's not all
law of nature very similar things were
Happening Here I should say I going say
take the women's movement which was just
beginning to take off at that time said
but one it began exactly the same way
with small Consciousness raising groups
group of women talking to each other and
saying you know
repression domination is not a law of
nature things will be changed you so let
let me ask you this is you can say all
of the above but I'm wondering here you
are in 6768 it's the height of the
Vietnam War you also your work in
linguistics is becoming really well
known and it's the relationship to the
rest of cognitive science when you
picked up this book was it more because
of political interest more because of
you know sort of just ideas um did it
have anything to do with the fact it was
ation and did have anything to the fact
that he focused very much on language
reading and words and things like that
do you have a sense of what Drew you to
it and what you took out of it both
because one of the things I'd been
working on in the 60s and couple of
books came out was the 17th and 18th
century
philosophy and uh a lot of the ideas are
kind of drawn from that I don't know if
he was conscious of it but uh if you
take a look at the enlightenment
conceptions of educ ation there were
basically two competing conceptions they
were presented in imagery one of the
images was thinking of Education as
pouring water into a vessel that's what
FR calls the banking model uh and what a
lot of you are familiar with it's
contemporary schooling in the United
States uh teaching to test you know pour
water into the vessel as every one of us
knows who's made it to College it's a
very leaky vessel you can you can study
for some for a test in some course
you're not interested in and pass the
test and a week later you forgot what
the course was about that's our current
educational system more and more uh and
it has a purpose I talk about it but U
and it sort of starts in the early 70s
in the modern say this part of the
reaction against the liberating
Tendencies and uh of the 60s that uh say
the women's movement here was part of
the antiw war
movement
aer's work in pedagogy of the
oppressed the median Bishop's conference
which adopted the preferential option
for the poor all of this is integrated I
in fact even the
literacy approach he was much influenced
by the highly successful uh uh literacy
program in Cuba in
1961 which had similar conceptions the
principle was
uh the teachers the literacy teachers
should go out to teach but also to learn
that's uh that's very fing as well
that's flattening the uh that's yeah and
they should break down the relation of
kind of domination between teacher and
student where the teacher essentially is
pouring water into the vessel so remind
me because later I want to ask both of
you why after at least three centuries n
internationally in at least a century
here of such an our um articulate
critique of this view why it remains so
so dominant but let's let's we're going
to come back to that later let's ask
Bruno now you um you weren't quite as
much on the seen in the 60s as some of
the rest of
us tell tell us a bit about you know
what you what you were doing when you
were when you first encountered fr's
work and what's your what's your stance
toward it what did you What attracted
you what did you get out of it well yeah
thank you Howard u in fact yes I was six
years old when this book was published
so uh I could read
already more
that that was it interestingly enough uh
the very first time I heard the name of
fray was um after most of my education
um including at University level and
being a linguist and a social linguist
and educator I had never heard his name
until I reached Mexico where I spent few
years of my life and told social
Linguistics there and and I had started
to develop a way of teaching which I
thought
was well adapted for me and hopefully
good for the people in the audience and
one of them one of the participants came
after one class and said you know what
you've read too much of frie and that
was the very first time in my life I
heard his
name I was like uh sorry I but of course
you know I didn't want to appear as the
guy who obviously doesn't know anything
about someone who everyone is supposed
to know so I said oh no you know I I
haven't read that much um what was the
name
again and in fact so I was
attracted my attention was attracted
this way but I didn't back then take the
time to really look for anything or Etc
I came across frary in a second uh way a
few years later uh and exactly as Nome
has said through my interest uh for
Liberation theology I read uh people
like Leonardo buff and Gustavo Gutierrez
and um of course Don de CA and so and I
came across the name again I thought
well okay one one of my students in
Mexico told me that I've read too much
of FR and now I find the name of this
guy again in in the books of these uh
liberation theologians what is that and
then I read this book for the first time
so that that took that took a while but
interestingly enough during all my years
or maybe I didn't pay attention maybe I
was asleep maybe it was not part of the
test that I had to learn b or whatever
but I don't remember having heard the
name of frie I heard probably 10 million
times the name of
P but I never heard the name of frar and
after a while I wondered why and I think
now I have some hypothesis on that why
is fr not that well known uh even if his
work is in in my view more relevant
than than it ever was it was of course
relevant when he wrote this uh at the
end of the 60s published 68 but in the
world we live in today and I would say
especially in this country or in the
western world it is more relevant than
ever well tell spell that out for us
well pedagogy of the oppressed since
since we have someone who has been busy
with Linguistics with us i' I'm tempted
to just you know take the title like
this and say well okay pedagogy why
pedagogy and not didactics after all he
was more involved in um you know adult
education Etc so it's not necessarily
about children but of of not for this is
crucial and oppressed the oppressed why
what does fray in this book understand
under the expression the
oppressed as far as I see and I read it
again of course before coming
here a couple of times I had a lot of
time to read um in the last month um I
read it and I thought well okay he is
writing at the end of the 60s in the
context that you um reminded us of
Howard and is of course extremely
involved in Latin America Brazil to
begin with and then Chile when he uh um
in Exile
fine so what he describes are oppressed
people in the sense of poor
people the preferential option for the
poor that uh no mantioned that was
that's an expression of Gustavo
Gutierrez actually published after this
book but uh taken by the U the the The
Bishop's conference in in in medine and
even more in pbla
1979 the poor which kind of poor are we
talking about and
does the definition of the oppressed
that FR gave 45 years ago still match
with the definition of the oppressed
today my very short answer to this one
to begin with and we'll come back to
this later on is to say the
following of course it does the
structure is still exactly the same only
it has become even more efficient in
terms of Oppression than it was probably
back
then however what might have changed and
that's that's a superficial level is
exactly who are the
oppressed Fray in this book doesn't
speak too much about the middle class I
know that you don't use it here in the
US the way we use it in Europe the
expression middle class but actually in
the in the context he's writing in the
middle class is maybe not that relevant
for his purpose so he's talking about an
elite the oppressors and a wide majority
of people who have basically nothing and
that is the oppressed now if you look at
our Western societies
today almost everybody I see around me
is oppressed in a way or another but at
the same time we are also
oppressors we are
oppressed by not only the oppressors
above us but by the invisible hand that
we all know about and because of that we
almost have no choice but to oppress
people who are around us or or or
whatever and I think that we can read
again Paulo fr's work today in this
sense without taking anything from his
fabulous uh Vision he was a Visionary
definitely a prophet in the true sense
of the word the one who announces and
denounces and
Etc my sense is that it is very easy for
the neoliberals today who are dominant
all over the place as you
know to say this is oldfashioned this is
superseded this is overtaken we can't
forget all this this is was good for the
60s let's hear Nome react to this what
as as Bruno speaking what are you
thinking well I'm thinking of what
happened since the 60s and I was already
beginning in the 60s in the early 60s if
you go back to Vatican 2 it was heresy
the idea that you should pay attention
to the gospels is absolute
heresy uh there's a nice
literary exposition of it in df's Grand
Inquisitor you're familiar with that
sort of captures it almost exactly but
the idea that uh probably know the story
but
U the the gospels is just too uh
revolutionary and too radical if you
really think about it and when this
became taken over by the Latin American
Bishops in fact a lot of it under their
influence particularly in Brazil there
was an immediate reaction to stamp it
out a dual
reaction part of the reaction came from
the Vatican that was the soft side that
was shutting people up like uh putting
them under a band chief enforcer for
this was uh ratzinger became Pope
Benedict later but it started under
right away almost after John Paul the
23rd died started big reaction shut them
up but just historically we do have 20
years of John Paul
between he was one of the leading
figures in shutting him up yeah he's
very much respected because he was in
favor it was opposed to Communism in
Eastern Europe and so on but what he did
in Latin America is quite different
that's a long story the irony is I mean
I think he he was genuinely beloved
there so you might say yes not that's a
much more mix story and I can talk about
it if you like but yeah there's an
interesting quote by heler CA about that
which I think captures the whole debate
Around The Liberation theology he said
something like uh when when I give
something to eat to the poor they called
me a saint when I ask why they are poor
and why they have nothing to eat they
called me a communist yeah that's and I
think H C with that captured the whole
thing and he himself was silenced in
1970 right at this is right in this
interim period between the Portuguese
and the English edition so that was the
soft side the harsh side was coming from
us the United States went to war against
the church fought a brutal violent war
against the church ever since the early
60s the Brazilian who which we backed
and supported was first major step and
it went right on through the murder of
the Archbishop and El Salvador the
Romero Archbishop Romero who was called
the voice for the voiceless he was
actually a
conservative Archbishop who was appalled
by what was happening to his priests
they were getting murdered because they
were trying to do things like uh pursue
the pedagogy the oppressed the uh
liberation of the poor you know and he
himself changed was a very honorable
person assassinated it kind of ended not
totally but it came to a sort of
symbolic end if you like right at time
of the fall of the Berlin wall when uh
uh an elite Al Salvadorian
Battalion uh trained and armed by the
United States which uh already had
killed
nobody knows how many thousands or tens
of thousands of the usual victims
peasants working people human rights
activists priests and others uh
were they had just come back from
renewed training updating upgrading
their skills at the John F Kennedy
School of counter Insurgency in North
Carolina they came back to El Salvador
and under the expit direct orders of the
high
command uh they were ordered to enter
the
university uh to murder six leading
Jesuit intellectuals Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests and also
anyone else who was there so there'd be
no Witnesses so they murdered their
housekeeper and her daughter uh uh this
is under the direct orders of the high
command close connection to the American
Embassy uh I doubt if there anybody here
who can even mention their names if you
mention dissidents in Eastern Europe
everybody can mention their names they
were treated badly but uh nothing like
what happened in Latin America during
the same years and uh but they're our
victims so therefore we don't know about
them uh but but through this period
there was as I said a really vicious war
against the church and the heresy was
pretty much Stamped Out not totally you
know
residues remain still alive but uh
suffered a severe attack and that's what
comes to mind when I talk about this and
the same things happen with the
educational system in my opinion at
least
the the kind of imposition of rigidity
and
conformism uh the banking model know the
fil The Vessel model it's the banking
model actually has a the banking model
has a double meaning now since we're
living in such a highly banked F's sense
you know pour water into the vessel but
let's that's since the it starts around
the time of the uh same repression in
Latin America let's come back to that in
in a couple minutes but I want to I
don't want to leave um fr's pedagogy
unexplored so I want to ask you a
question but it's also for the audience
have many of you actually spent real
time either
watching the work that he did with
adults peasants in Latin America or
analogous work in North America or are
we talking about something like you know
John dwey school which was only opened
for a few years had a lot of influence
but not because there were many people
who had actually been there and seen
there I did I was
Wonder but I'm asking about F now not
not John
Dey but did either of you actually ever
see
um you know the kind of very equal
drawing out giving agency to the the the
impoverished that he writes about or is
it something you just know from his
anyone who spent any time in poor areas
in Latin America but in fact other parts
of the world I see I see things like
this happening but I messing this is
this is not a a tribunal but I'm
actually interested whether you actually
saw The Fray Methods at work yourselves
yeah yeah I I did to some extent uh
especially in Latin America because as I
said before um in the in yeah North
America and in Europe the name Fray is
hardly known except by um experts and
not even by experts maybe from time to
time but in Latin America uh there are
uh institutions which
are generally not mainstream by the way
or uh um they cannot be mainstream which
are linked to the church or to this
particular uh movement within the church
liberation theology or coming from uh a
more um Marxist kind of um framework
which is U you know dedicated to what is
called educ Popular um and in some
institutions I have seen including at
University level people take this very
serious seriously and uh my sense is
that consciously enough they are
extremely influenced by by FR I say
consciously or not because again you
know um sometimes you just it's always
the same thing what I when this student
told me you know that I had read too
much of fry and I said sorry I don't
even know the name of that guy I'm not
suggesting that I had reinvented
everything myself of course not I had
certainly been influenced through other
channels and consciously by people who
themselves have been influenced by by F
and Etc this is always the problem how
are you sure that one idea of yours is
original you you can never be completely
sure now the point is that in sorry
Howard but in in some universities and I
remember that very well in Mexico
particularly I've seen that in in Peru
as well and and uh in some other
countries in Nicaragua that that's quite
obvious uh Ernesto cardal you you may
have met with him was a a Jesuit who was
a liberation theolog attacked by Pope
right exactly he he became Minister for
education and then he was sort of sacked
by by the church Pope yeah yeah right
exactly and in a very humiliating way on
top of that now the the fact of the
matter is that there there are people
especially in Latin America who really
believe in the virtue of this say
pedagogy of the oppressed and try to
implement it but they face a lot of
resistance and inertia from above if I
may say so that's quite obvious but also
from the people they are addressing it's
fear of Freedom it's uh anything you
want you know FR describes that very
well that it is not that easy to go and
tell people think by yourself think for
yourself it is very dangerous and most
people would resist it even VI if I can
add something to that remember that PR
was not just teaching literacy in fact
if you look at his pedagogy of the
oppressed it's Consciousness raising
that's the the point literacy is an
instrument for it and conscious
Consciousness raising leads to is should
he think s say straight out lead to a
radical and revolutionary change a
change in the institutions when people
understand actually this you know this
goes back to the history I I've seen it
all over the place not just in poor
communities and know Southern Colombia
and Latin America but elsewhere in the
world so take India I don't know how
many of you know anything about India
but there's one poor relatively poor uh
state in India Kerala uh which uh has an
extremely high level of literacy and
also and specifically and education
generally and incidentally of women's
education and that's the reason why
fertility goes straight down it's been a
consequence of women's education but you
get and sort of women's control control
of what they can do that literacy that
fertility goes way down it's not it's a
very poor place and if you visit it you
see it it's the one part of India where
you can kind of drive around and see
people sitting at a you know little bar
or something sitting outside reading uh
newspapers talking to each other and so
on Al the other place I saw it in these
in West Bengal uh in
the what they called Pat The Cooperative
Village
which sprang up in the course of a
revolution it was a you know killed the
landlords drove him out took over the
region and it's pretty I could talk
about it but it's pretty amazing when
you see it and what you see is one of
them when I went in with a friend an
agricultural
Economist uh that happened to be a
village council meeting going on these
are very poor Villages you know and um
there was a an officer an Indian
government officer in the
background a years before he would have
been running the meeting telling
everyone what to do uh this time he was
kind of in the background occasionally
they' turned to him and asked for some
information or something but it had
nothing to do with anything The Village
Council was local people talking pretty
very informed eloquent ways one of them
was actually a tribal woman you know
that's about the lowest of the low in
the
Indian awful cast system but she was one
of the council members talked to others
telling people you know her opinion and
so on this is all the result of years of
conscientization uh in Fair sense not
just literacy but learning who you are
what your rights are why you can
overcome oppression taking control of
your lives and that's what the
heresy was in Latin America the you know
people going priests others going into
the poor areas and trying to bring this
about sometimes
borrowing uh a F's methods and remember
that there much Brer because Cuba had
done something like it a couple years
earlier which he knew very well talked
about uh but uh and that's why they had
to be crushed uh that's why again if you
read The Grand in Inquisitor it's say it
very precisely in this case the United
States was a grand Inquisitor at the
risk of being a little bit pedantic I
want to draw out something which uh um
was stated by Bruno and that is thinkers
can have a lot of influence on what we
think and do if we don't know about them
um and I think that uh probably there
are you know people here who knew
nothing about fra but whose ideas came
to some extent because of the diffusion
also it was in reading about him that I
realized that he was also the part of a
wide- ranging intellectual tradition as
well as you know somebody who not
entirely through his own desire was in
Chile and was in here in Cambridge and
so on and that is he was um very much
influenced by um the French
existentialists and the notion of
Consciousness sart and who serve and um
that that phenomenology that school but
also um interestingly by people who were
looking at uh psychoanalytic ideas like
uh Eric F and Herbert maruza and so
here's a guy who on the one hand is
writing very practically about what you
should be doing if you want to raise
Consciousness and get people to have a
sense of agency but he's also involved
in a web of middle 20th century
intellectual um infl infuences whether
they go back to the 17th and 18th
century probably at least implicitly
they do I want to ask though um if
there's anybody in the audience who
actually has an anecdote based on his
his or her own observation of um ferian
ideas even better if you they were
explicitly called that because the India
probably people didn't know that
terminology and who knows where it it
comes spontaneously from situation and
circumstances okay well why don't we
take this gentleman
here yes thank you so my name is Miguel
Reay and I stud studied in Bogota in the
70s in a private university and I I'm
going to say half of my
University uh became very leftist
because of freya's ideas and frya was
really truly very influential and
actually the the term mamerto was born
was used at the time all these leftist
friends of mine and and their ideas that
were very
conscientization um today are very
wealthy people doing very well that was
a private university like this
University here University Los andz very
expensive and the ter ter mertos is
those who would love to be this way but
end up being this other way and and the
the sadness is is that one thing was the
the the dream or the the desire to to
change change things and and it never
happened thank you I think that that's
uh something we're going to come back to
at the end when we talk about Utopia and
dystopia and we've all been around long
enough to have been swung in different
directions is there anybody else uh one
other person yeah please this this is
not a
setup um hi my name is scina uh in
Mexico and my experience in chapas uh
spending time in zapa communities the
school system there the autonomous
school system is set up based on the
principles of f whether or not it's
explicit or otherwise um the school does
run under Consciousness raising uh
framework where students are taught
about what it means to be themselves
whether they be chol or toal or whatever
ethnicity as well as um citizenry within
the Mexican nation state and how
neoliberalism Works in their lives and
in their communities so that I've seen
that in action
um in small very small communities in
chapus Mexico thank you so um as I was
doing my homework I have to admit that I
was shocked when I picked up the hulo FR
reader and discovered that uh as early
as page four of the introduction uh The
Whipping Boy was the Harvard Graduate
School of Education um and so I want to
read a few
quotations uh I me gnome was here at the
time time so and his wife was teaching
um so they may have some context and
it's possible somebody else in the
audience as well so it begins by Des by
describing a professor who is not named
commenting on a graduate student's paper
and the comment is critical especially
mentioning quote unquote FR and Jiro
jiru was probably the leading student of
uh student acolyte would be a better
word um how else can one EXP exp laain a
culture that pontificates about
intellectual rigor and yet allows a
graduate course titled politics of
literacy to be taught without any
reference to fra um continuing in fact
if one applies rigorous standards of the
academy we s we soon realize that most
of the professors at hgsc that's what's
the words here are not among the most
cited Educators in the United States the
work has done little to advance
theoretical debate theyve contributed
few Earth shaking ideas that might help
to raise schools um it's no wonder that
after a lecture was given about Paulo
frer um at the school of
education this is this is Bruno here I
don't want to sound naive but who is
this Paulo frer the professor is
sighting a lot um and then this is where
it gets it gets angry um how can one
expect this doctoral student to know of
the work of the most significant
educator in the world during the last
half century when the Harvard Graduate
School of Education sanctions a graduate
course called literacy politics and
policy without requiring students to
read critique and analyze the work of
frer and then I I had to chuckle at this
last comment here what can what can
expect from a culture in which a
professor responded to fr's death which
was 1997 in the following manner FIS
coming to Harvard would have made 20
students very happy while making the
rest of the students extremely unhappy
uh then the person does say now he's
dead and we're all unhappy but that may
be a personal statement so can you help
us understand why this reader begins
with this is is Harvard a metonym here
or do you know whether there were things
that were going on here it's Donaldo moo
it's Donaldo I don't know but he's he
doesn't love herever for a lot of
reasons but but give give us a little
context cuz I was kind of shocked it's
not the school of education it's entire
University okay so it's metonymic then
entire University is like that uh I mean
there are things as a student you just
don't learn and aren't taught so take
today for example May 1 I this morning
one of the first coincidence well the
first uh emails I got this morning was
from a friend in Brazil and uh she wrote
me that uh she's going to it's not going
to go to work today it's a holiday what
are they
celebrating there it's it's a day of
Comm I don't know how many of you know
this but it's a day of commem of uh it's
a day
of supporting the struggle of American
workers for an8 hour day that's Mayday
everywhere in the world except the
United States and the UK and the UK and
UK also yeah that's a it's it's our
Colony you know
right but uh here's a day
commemorating the whole world
practically uh as
supporting highly oppressed American
workers some of the most oppressed in
the industrial World in 1886 it's not
modern uh and in the United States
nobody ever heard of it in fact Ronald
Reagan one of the most extreme uh anti-
labor presidents turned it into law day
a day of uh celebrating our dedication
to law actually we have a labor day but
think when it is our Labor Day is when
people go back to work that's Labor Day
not the day in which they struggle for
their rights you know for an 8 hour day
well just pick that because it happens
to be today but the number of things we
don't learn is amazing like for example
how many of you learned about the
us war against the church in in the
through the 60s from the 60s to the
through the 80s I mean nobody learns
that how many of you even heard of the
names of the murdered
Jesuits actually I give you an an
illustration of what on the 25th
anniversary of Archbishop Roma's death
there was actually a commemoration in
Boston but it wasn't in Harvard Square
it was in Jamaica plan in a poor Church
poor immigrant Church yes there they had
a commemoration of Romero's death one of
the speakers was a woman Miriam manah
who was had been a Salvador and judge
her husband was also human rights
activist murdered by us trained forces
in El Salvador who were carrying out
huge massacres but it's in Jamaica plane
on the 30th iversary of the
assassination of the Jesuits which is a
pretty serious event I mean if that had
happened in
Czechoslovakia we' probably had a
nuclear war you know but here 30th
Anniversary there was a commemoration it
was in Boston College Jesuit college and
it was quite well done the president
who's pretty conservative was there one
of the speakers was uh father Yan saino
he's uh the one un
surviving uh Jesuit from the University
he didn't happen to be there when the
assassination team came so he spoke he
gave a very moving speech in which he
said look we shouldn't be uh mourning
the Jesuit intellectuals who were killed
but rather their housekeeper and
daughter they're the ones we should be
focusing on the ones who are killed so
there wouldn't be any
Witnesses because they represent the
people of El Salvador the real victims
not just the famous
intellectuals anybody know anything
about this you know I mean these are
things that ought to be taught in grade
school uh and you can go on and on and
the reason why a FY was unknown is
because he was not just talking about
literacy if he'd been saying here's a
nice method for teaching literacy to
adults that would have been fine but it
went way beyond that it was literacy as
a means for Consciousness raising for
raising questions about your position
among the oppress and why you should
accept that and why you shouldn't what
the society is like and how should how
it should be changed by us standards he
was a radical revolutionary of course
he's un known let me ask um and this is
um only if somebody actually has any any
additional comments because they were
around at this time um there will be a
chance to speak up I I may be around but
I have to admit um I was one of these
people who knew p and not not f um
though um I was aware of him but no
different than I was aware of montor or
of Steiner these were names and you
picked up things um but certainly I was
aware of other intellectual Traditions
having dealing with Latin America
Catholicism radicalism um I don't think
there was any conspiracy not to teach
him here but I think it's interesting
that machedo does use it metonymically
but is there anybody here who could
provide any additional context on this
or should we put it aside okay we'll
give take a you don't look like you
could have been there but we'll we'll
assume that you're a
historian hi my name is Swati and I'm
also uh from India uh it was interesting
for me when I came to The Graduate
School of Education that I saw an
absence of absolute absence of ferrer's
name any where and for all of the
courses that I took I didn't ever read F
and I did a ma bachelor's and Masters in
elementary education in India and the
book entire book was prescribed so uh
I'd read for through six years of my
education in India when when I came to
the at school here there was no thought
of uh there was no thought around
ferrera's work and I also thought that I
don't think it's it's it's a random sort
of incident I also feel that it's part
of the larger uh larger way in which
curriculum is framed in this University
where there's no space for Marxist
thought itself in the department of
Economics there is maybe one Professor
which teaches a a course in Marxism in
at the at school when we talk about the
politics of Education we often we don't
ever discuss what does it mean to uh uh
what was Gandhi's notion of Education
what was F's notion of Education what
was you know some of these other
thinkers which uh think differently than
this larger neoliberal regime of uh
standardized education thought about
education I just absolutely see an
absence of that debate and discourse in
America so I I see this as a consequence
of sort of that framework rather than a
random Incident That's all I want that's
a very very valuable contribution thank
you I guess and I think we all should
feel a little bit bad that if you that
in India this was not this was not a
foreign uh a infecting agent um I mean I
I you know I'm not going to uh give a an
exposition on the school but I think
that uh we could do well to be much more
alert to intellectual currents including
ones that might make us uncomfortable
you want to uh no no just just one quick
you teach here after all nobody tells
you what to teach
so true I have to think about that that
I
will actually Ju Just when you when you
read this uh this page Howard uh I I was
wondering something in the same
direction what would FR all the people
who have edited this book his widow and
Donaldo maso say today about hugy not
how it was 40 years ago I mean it that I
wasn't there you may know but but what
would they say today is the banking
system of
Education alive Even In This Very
institution and if yes how and is this
really can can we learn something from
frar and I'm not only talking about hexi
obviously but about our universities in
general and how we train and um well
teachers and people who are going to be
responsible for the future of mankind
because this is it actually now
regarding the in in this country as far
as I understand the word communist is
one of the worst possible insults you
can imagine now if if you have someone
who quotes on on a regular basis in a
small book like that KL Marx and maong
and Herbert maruza and gor lucak uh not
George Lucas gor lucak
right and France Fon and and and people
like that and even
chivara I mean it's alone per se even if
you just look at the references it is
probably enough for quite a lot of
people in our societies to just discard
it and say this is dangerous stuff you
know uh but you know I'm GNA interrupt
here for a second because I think the
notion would not be that it's dangerous
the notion would be that it's irrelevant
and that's equally damning but it's a
very different precisely I wanted to
come to that because there is something
in my view I said well uh fyie re refers
directly to chivara and to Gustavo
Gutierrez who by the way were born in
the same year 1928 which was a very good
year for for thinkers am I right no
[Music]
yes I noticed that I noticed that you
were just exactly as old as chivar and
gust so it's all the stars right it's
all the stars exact
exactly so fortunately we still have no
man Gustav with us now the point is is
this and that's exactly what you're
pointing at how it is not about you know
oh we don't want to hear about that
because it's dangerous you know it's
Marx or it's Darwin or whatever you want
to diabolize in a way or another in in
this country or in in other Western
countries it is something like a very
sharp discourse that has developed in my
to my knowledge or to for what I've seen
dramatically over the last 10 years is
to dismiss ideas like that as irrelevant
old-fashioned super it over you you name
it most of you or some of you at least
know where I come from and in which
institution I was working ET we talk
talk a bit about that because that's
what I wanted to segue in and then we'll
open it up precisely I I spent uh I'm
I'm I'm almost embarrassed to confess it
right now but I spent 14 years of my
life uh at the oecd in the directorate
for Education explain what oecd is oh
yes uh uh Organization for economic not
education eon economic cooperation and
development among other things the
directorate for education has produced a
few uh flagships that are extremely well
known such as Pisa for instance and
stuff like that well Pisa is certainly a
very interesting
study however some of us a minority a
small
minority had a critical stance from the
beginning and say well look pza is
interesting is certainly one of the most
powerful uh comparative tool that has
been developed so far in terms of you
know uh well comparing performances of
15 year olds here and there however it's
statistics for God's sake and it's only
statistics you have statistics as but
you what does it tell you nothing you
remain at the surface of the whole thing
and then the the the discussion started
but it was crashed very quickly say oh
you guys are oldfashioned you you you
are like you know 68ers or it's said
look at your hair you're completely
superseded no you know exactly that sort
of things and then I said well look I I
wonder actually if it's not too easy to
say to take for instance in a book like
that or in what we've done examples that
are actually yes maybe a bit out of date
to completely dismiss very powerful
ideas that go back well beyond 68 to the
Gospels or two other uh uh writing of of
of wisdom that we have in in all great
uh philosophical systems just one thing
Quanto frenia you know this tendency of
uh Quanto frenia Quant ofren you heard
it first here yeah right no no but oh no
some some some here are familiar with
that I'm sure uh yeah it's this this
tendency of the social scien is to want
to put everything in numbers in order to
look serious like like the Natural
Sciences but in fact it is in the first
place to look serious but at the very
end of the day it is much worse than
that it is a way to not go deeper into
the explanation again it is one thing to
say so many people are living under this
um you know standard of
poverty once you have said that you're
still not asking why are these people
living under this standard and when you
say for instance in this country or in
that country in stories like in in
studies like Pisa for instance so many
children succeed so many children do not
succeed and Etc fine now let's talk why
is that we can go further we can go
deeper Pisa provides the tools for that
but as soon as you start to discuss it
and you say well look at the socio
economic and social cultural background
of these kids who are failing at school
then you are quot a communist or
something like that and this is very
related to this you know you mentioned s
and boir and and and so forth I mean
these guys were highly respected in
Europe especially in France you know
it's not every day that in France we
have great thinkers
so we had we had theart and and BVO and
and well and now we have well now you
know
anyway but but these people were highly
respected in the 60s I'm not sure that
FR came directly in contact with s but
through trans fenon he certainly did
today these people are dismissed as
totally out ofd I I think just without
passing any judgment on it I think that
the fall of Communism as as symbolized
by the wall um falling gave many people
license we won't even evaluate it to
dismiss pre um pre 89 discourse I want
to ask gome a question which may make
him
even more philosophical than he usually
is but no mentioned something very
interesting that we were talking about
when you're sick what do you do and the
answer is you read and you mentioned
that you had read Hegel because you had
to go to the hospital and what else you
going to do in the you said if you're
weren't going to read Hegel now You'
never going to read him so I was
there I was there in the late 60s but
not at all Central than the way you were
were than you were but looking at the
last 40
years could you have
anticipated what we call among ourselves
the neoliberal trend and to what extent
is it hegelian in the sense of synthesis
of you know thesis and so on or are
there more accidental things that um you
know if uh you know well I should say
that the Nixon hadn't come or Reagan
hadn't come with thater yeah I think it
was already already tell us yeah uh
first of all I I read a Hegel because I
thought it was quite funny I thought it
was some of the craziest stupidest
things i' ever seen and I would I could
I've actually written about it a little
some of it is totally outlandish but uh
uh but in the uh but you know but I'm
talking about pendum when I talko yeah
well by the late by the early 70s there
was already a very striking backlash
very visible quite public against the uh
liberating
democratizing Tendencies of the
1960s right here at Harvard in fact it
was very clear so for example one famous
Harvard Professor uh Samuel Huntington a
professor of Science of government at
Harvard he was the author of U he was
the raer the American
rter in
a in a in a uh conference which was
published of the was called the
trilateral commission uh it's called the
crisis of democracy you should read it
if you haven't yet it's very interesting
I think it's about came out about 74 or
75 uh this the trilateral commission
represents the liberal Fringe of
American politics so it's basically the
Carter Administration in fact Carter
Administration came almost completely
from their ranks it's not the right way
the what's what's the crisis of
democracy this is mostly Huntington but
also representatives from France and uh
Japan who basically said the same things
crisis of democracy was that in the 60s
there was too much
democracy uh and that puts uh all sorts
of groups that are usually passive and
acquiescent what are sometimes called
special interests began to enter the
political Arena to press for for their
own demands their Consciousness was
raised uh women young people old people
working people Farmers all special
interests uh population in other words
their special interests and they were
trying to enter the political Arena
press for the demands it's interesting
that in this entire discussion one group
is not mentioned the corporate sector
the business world and there's a reason
for that they're not special interest
they're the national interest uh that's
tacitly understood cool but it's sort of
you may understand it that's part of
being oppressed so they're not mentioned
uh but the special interests have to be
U subdued we have to have what
Huntington called more moderation in
democracy they have to go back to paity
and acquiescence and they didn't miss
the schools uh he talked about what he
what they call what he called the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young okay that's
where you are responsible for the
indoctrination of the young the schools
the universities the churches and the
point was they're not doing their job
they're not indoctrinating the young
properly and you can see it by all these
uh you know women asking for rights
people demonstrating against the war
these people are supposed to be
indoctrinated they're supposed to be
passive obedient acquiescent they're not
supposed to have their Consciousness
raised that's the early 70s incidentally
that's the liberal aspect of it at the
very same time I won't go into it you
but I urge you to read a pretty famous
memorandum called the Powell memorandum
it was
a a Powell who later became a Supreme
Court justice under nion he was a was
actually a lobbyist for the tobacco
industry but a very influential
right-wing figure he wrote a memorandum
which was supposedly confidential
supposed to be confidential was sent to
the American Chamber of Commerce main
business group it leaked and people
could read it if they want it's worth
reading uh that's the harsh end what he
says basically is look the business
classes in the United States the most
oppressed group in the country uh
everybody else is getting everything and
we're getting nothing uh the radicals
like Herbert maruza and the you know
Ralph nater and others are just
destroying the whole society uh they're
uh and they've got to be and the
universities are totally out of hand you
know they're all Marxist crazies running
around and uh we the business classes
are utterly oppressed but then he says
look we have the money
we control the legislator we control the
trustees uh we don't have we're the uh
owners of the media we don't have to let
these radicals take over everything and
you have to read it this see the
rhetoric that's what it's like uh so
therefore we should use our power as our
control of wealth to beat back this
attack on the essentials of civiliz
ation you know which is going on that's
the right-wing variant of Samuel
Huntington and the trilateral
commission's uh liberal variant but both
agree you've got a the the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young have to meet their
responsibilities and we have to change
them so they do that that's the early
when you become hegelian for a moment
hold on hold on one second let me say
that for those of you who know the
history of American Education nothing
new about this it goes back to the
origins of the mass education system
that was a great contribution of in the
United States Mass public education but
it had some
qualifications a large part of it was a
effort to turn independent Farmers into
obedient passive Factory workers and you
had to educate them for that and it was
recognized so Ralph Waldo Emerson for
example pointed out that he said he
hears lots of influential people calling
for Mass
education and uh when he asks them why
it's they explain that look there are
millions of people getting the right to
vote and we have to educate them to keep
them from our
throats because if they're not properly
indoctrinated they're going to
understand what's going on in the world
and they'll go after our throats and
here I would slightly disagree with the
distinction between dangerous and
irrelevant I think they're the same
thing these things are irrelevant
because they're dangerous if people
think about them they're going to go
after the throats you know symbolically
of uh those with power they'll uh ask
for their rights too and that's just
much too dangerous so and this is a
current that you know runs through it's
related to the fact that nobody knows
what Mayday is in the United States it's
distinct from ever world uh all of this
is part of the of a system of
indoctrination which in F's terms is
provides the culture of submission in
fact what he called the culture
of that Freedom From Fear it took it
over from from uh from you know escape
from freedom and people have to and the
idea of the cons Consciousness raising
programs of which the literacy program
was a part was to overcome this on the
part of people well we start getting the
reaction in the early '70s and it goes
on and it takes various forms and it now
reaches forms that have names like No
Child Left Behind or race to the top
which means every Child Left Behind and
race to the bottom uh and that's a an
anybody who's a teacher
n i i i i do want to open up to to the
audience but I'm going to be insistent
on knowing whether you think the 60s
were an anomalous blip no um you don't
no the 30s were similar okay the N 189
19 1890s were simp look in in the latter
part of the 19th century if anybody
studies it the most powerful and
impressive uh radical Democratic
movements in the United States took
shape and were extremely strong the
farmers Alliance incidentally which
began in Texas this is not today Farmers
Alliance was then spread throughout the
country remember it was an agricultural
country then so huge organization you
take a look at its goals and actions
they were pretty radical uh they wanted
to get rid of the Eastern Bankers who
were strangling them uh they wanted to
be able control to have Cooperative uh
marketing Cooperative Banks uh run
things by themselves massive movement
they tried to unite with the Knights of
Labor which was a huge labor movement uh
also calling for you know workers
ownership of the factories in which they
worked on all sorts of ideas which now
are considered outlandish okay they were
crushed by force but it was a huge
movement this is a deep point I want to
give both of you guys a chance for a
last word as we get towards seven so you
can be thinking about that I want to
open it up but I think the answer to
your question is though you won't like
this you are schinger sches Aran and you
think it's going to be about now that
we're going to have a swing of the
pendulum again no I don't I think it's
constant there's a constant battle going
on it's called di it's called class
struggle there's a constant battle going
on between poor and oppressed people who
are seeking their rights and it can be
pretty wealthy people like say middle
class women uh but are oppressed and
seeking their rights and those who want
to keep them in their place uh simple as
that and just to remind you what markx
did was to turn Hegel on his head but
then you have to go read it read so
let's open it up and we'd like people to
just come up to the two mics and the
rules are be succinct and um question
should have to do with what we talked
about if you want to know about the stat
status of traces and linguistic Theory
that's for another day hi my name is uh
Ben buer and um of course Paul fer was
writing in the develop uh developing
country uh but if we think about in the
developed sense it strikes me that when
he talks about reading the word and
reading the world is very important uh
to our context as well what I'm
wondering is why don't we have a
dedicated curriculum either in K through
12 or at the University level for
critical literacy so often we focus on
content uh you know mastering one
subject or another but rarely uh in
either K through2 or college do we
actually have a course dedicated on on
critical literacy skills and it seems
like that would be an important preface
to the learning process so I'm wondering
if Professor Chomsky or or anyone else
would care to comment on the need to
introduce aarian style of critical
literacy to our
context I think they will do is let's
take three or four questions I'll jot
down the uh keyword words and then we'll
let them
riff please I noticed a lot of people
more people in that side of the room uh
go ahead I'm Tori Thon homer I'm a
doctoral student here at the Ed school
and before this I was trained at UCLA's
teacher education program where FR was
an integral part of our education so I
wondered if you had insight as to why
the Harvard Graduate educ School of
Education doesn't really teach frah and
if it is
fear please
um it's a pleasure
to
excellent um pleasure to be here and
thank you so much for having us all um
my question goes related to um Fred you
know he believed in um the oppressed
taking charge of of their education
right and and making it their own
example of redemption rather than
somebody influencing them and um under
that context we're seeing how in Latin
America for example in Ecuador uh
they're building cities of knowledge um
in kicha jaai right cities of knowledge
where they're trying to empower the
people to take advantage of the
resources and they're trying to bring
hundreds of phds from all over the world
to create like the MIT you know of of
Latin America and things like that and
and I find that amazing because it
hasn't happened you know uh yet um
Professor chsky what's your prediction
um of the impact of schools like this in
100 years 200 years in Latin America
where um we're seeing some sort of
conscious and awareness uh regardless of
your political beliefs um in in this
parts of the world I didn't quite get
that question did you no um what is your
what is your prediction of the impact
that this cities of knowledge being
built in in Latin America cities of
knowledge I guess every every developing
country wants to be the next silic Valle
forer education why don't we take one
more question umia we'll get to you
later if there's time
okay my name is Heather Pritchard and
I'm a student here at The Graduate
School of Education I recently recently
read a book um in which Donaldo maso was
interviewing Freer and frier said denal
don't let them as in them in the US
import my ideas they are not made for
export please make sure they reinvent
them considering the idea that we here
in America may be oppressed and
oppressors at the same time what advice
would you offer to us here in this room
on how to practically reinvent F's
pedagogy of the oppressed nice question
thank you let me remind you guys of the
four questions then you can each um make
some comments number one um should we be
doing critical literacy in K to 12 um
number two why is there no FR GSC and
I'm going to actually take that one
um uh and my answer I think will
surprise you um cities of knowledge
there's that's a buzzword what do we
predict is going to happen there there
and then finally this very interesting
quote which you get from many great
thinkers is they say don't transport the
stuff reinvent it um if I'm paraphrasing
Bruna why you well yeah I'll try to be
very short and address each and every
question here
um well another book written by and and
published by fre after this one is
called education for critical
Consciousness and I think it's an
extremely powerful work as well now to
answer your question or no not not to
answer but my answer to your question
would be something
like how do you run a country where you
have more than say 60 or 70% of the
people actually able to critically
think uh it is it is a very sad way of
putting things
everywhere I I went so far and
especially meeting with the people in
ministries and Etc policy makers and
everybody says yeah we want to raise you
know the the level of education for
everyone Etc but in fact it is not
exactly true there is a a sort of
tension here between two different uh
aspirations one is in order to be
competitive at economic level we need to
raise uh educational standards but at
the same time we don't want to raise
them too much otherwise it starts to be
dangerous for the power
of uh those people FR C uh the
oppressors so my sense is that there is
a lot of hollow incantation there we
want to raise critical Consciousness but
at the same time we make sure that it
doesn't that it only affects an elite
otherwise it starts to be unmanageable
that is one thing at the same time uh
frie addresses a lot what he calls the
dadmy student teacher and he is's
dreaming of having you know students
teachers and teacher students I think
it's George is who said whoever seizes
to be a student has never been a student
and in fact well I know that many of us
try to do that when we teach because
actually we teach in order to learn and
Etc and and our students know so many
things that we don't know and personally
I believe in the collective construction
of knowledge
it is not very easy to achieve but at
least in a place like that I think it is
possible probably easier than in many
other places and the the katamy student
teacher that uh prias is describing as
something you know negative and that's
part of the banking system and the top
down kind of hierarchical relationship
and Etc that has to be Revisited
overcome if not suppressed is probably
something that is very important here uh
collective intelligence may be another
form of intelligence to be added to
Howard's multiple
intelligences the ultimate intelligence
is something I cannot believe that many
brains are less perform or less how do
you say yeah performing or less well
performing than just one and I think
Fray in this sense it's not political
not really not primarily political but I
think it's extremely powerful and he
again as far as critical Consciousness
is concerned one thing that he stresses
very much and people who know me here in
the room know that it's one of my uh
delenda cago kind of say uh he opposes
the duxa to the logos just as PL did and
say you are coting the Duca you have
this beautiful expression in English
which says thinking out of the box I
identify the box with the daxa in order
to think out of the box the very first
thing that you have to do is to identify
the Box know that there is one see what
it is see what kind of function it
performs what what what purpose does it
serve and finally be sort
of revolting against this and say I want
to be able to think out of the box that
is imposed on me by the oppressors with
the invisible hand or whatever and I
think this is in my you the one of the
very still very powerful messages by
Fray he opposes doxa and logos logos as
you know has so many translations but
then we go back to the gospels as you
said John 1:1 in the beginning was the
word the logos there we are this is what
we educators are all about I
think sir sorry you heard you heard
a a poem as well as yes some some
question there I should just picking up
on what Bruno said I mean there are
functioning examples of what you
describe in fact
uh I happen to be have been in one for
almost 60 years and any uh Advanced
School of Science is pretty much like
that in fact The Sciences would die if
there wasn't constant
Challenge and questioning uh students in
a you know place like MIT are not
supposed to copy down what they hear and
repeat it in an exam they're supposed to
say you're wrong you know I got a better
idea and if you're standing up in the
front of the room you learn from that in
fact that's the way it works uh when you
walk down the hall you do see what you
commonly see is students working
together you know in a group uh trying
to figure something out contributing a
large part of Education I'm sure you all
know this is just a pure
interaction my son actually went to
Harvard sailed through everything fun he
told me that the most he learned more
from talking to his fellow students than
he learned from in class the classes
were okay but uh he just got a lot out
of The Interchange and interaction with
and
uh I think that's that's so for example
one you know standard line a place like
MIT actually was comes from a f world
famous physicist who you probably knew
Vicky Vice you know great physicist uh
was famous because uh he taught freshman
courses like lot of senior faculty do
and
uh he had
this he s he said that when he was asked
in the class by the at the opening
sessions what are we going to cover this
semester his answer was it doesn't
matter what we cover it matters what you
discover in your own ways and that's
education and that incidentally goes
right back to the enlightenment I
mentioned earlier that there were kind
of two counterposed models one was what
frir calls the banking model you know
fill the vessel with water that's one
that was condemned another image that
was used actually by the founder of the
modern University system Phil Hol was
that education ought to be like uh
laying out a string along which the
learner proceeds in his or her own way
uh and learns to inquire and create and
uh maybe push the string around and uh
so in other words this it's come kind of
s structure there's a it's not just do
any random thing you want throw paint at
the wall there's a structure but you're
supposed to explore it question it uh
modify it and uh basically learn how to
create and discover and inquire on your
own actually it's not impossible I
mentioned for a moment ago that to
Howard that I was at a I happen to be in
a dite school when was a kid the uh
Temple University back 1930s you know
prehistoric times was uh uh had a had a
very the education department had a very
strong 28 uh element in it and they ran
an experimental school and uh my parents
sent it to me I was there from about age
two up until age 12 and it was a
fantastic experience I mean it's it was
pretty much along these lines
there were tests but they were only to
let you know where you stand you know
something that you ought to know that
you don't know or maybe let the teacher
know I'm doing something wrong because
things aren't working the way they
should but nobody there was no
evaluation of students and it wasn't
part necessarily there were there were
students from families like my own who
just were very interested in education
but there were other kids who were
behavior problems in the in the Public
Schools they couldn't handle them so
they sent them here that was quite a
mixture but there was
no
evaluation I literally didn't know I was
a good student until I went to an
academic high school after very horrible
experience academic high school but but
until then you know I was just a kid in
the class I mean I knew I had ski a
grade but all that that meant to anybody
was I was the smallest kid in the class
you know nothing nothing else mattered
when my own kids went to school to
what's called a good Public School
Lexington public schools and by the time
they were in third grade they were
already ranking the students he's dumb
he's smart you know he's this and that
it was nothing like that and there was a
lot of Cooperative work individual work
you followed your own individual
interests if you wanted to teachers
would you know help you with resources
and things but uh encourage that but
also encourage and organize a lot of
Cooperative work so I I'm convinced that
it can be done you experience without
our having asked for it I think n
Chomsky has actually shared with us his
education philosophy which I have heard
about over the years I think very very
beautifully um I should um mention that
MIT I think over the years you've been
in MIT as long as I've been in Harvard
um I think is somewhat more open to
confrontation there's a certain
gentility at Harvard which um I think
maybe it's less um less less directly
confrontational in many ways um I
personally I said I was going to say
something about frir at the Ed school um
I don't believe for a minute that there
was any uh censoring I think you need
and this is why the last question was
such an interesting one I think you need
somebody who is um who's going to be a
uh an enthusiastic presenter and who can
translate something which could seem
like it's from another part of the world
and for adults into something which as I
think came out today you know whether
you agree with everything said is much
much much broader than that it has
Universal aspects and it isn't tied
particularly to age and if you know
gnome is right you know there are waxing
and waning over time with the extent to
which the the raising of Consciousness
and the flattening of of hierarchy is is
is more likely than than than not um
since we're going past seven um I'd like
to give Bruno a chance if he has any
last words and also gnome and maybe you
they'll be stay around a bit more in
case people have uh quick questions
Bruno thank you Howard uh one
minute you you sort of forced gnome to
come back to Hegel because he had read
Hegel thanks to the hospital uh FR
actually refers to Hager and to the
Master Slave
dialectics which he parallels with the
uh teacher student at the academy and of
course when it comes to oppress or
oppressed and Etc but my sense is this
if Fray is still relevant today it's
because un fortunately or fortunately
maybe for us because this is also
there's a reason for Hope in this what
he's describing is probably as old as
Mankind and will stay even after us and
Etc which is certainly no reason to just
say well okay well in that
case what does it matter my sense is
that what he says what frie tells us
today and again with this sort of
religious spirit that he has
that he was influenced by is that we are
spoonfed a trinity where the father is
the capital the Messiah is the market
and the Holy Spirit is the free
enterprise and we are spoonfed this on a
daily basis by the media by everything
remember gnome's manufacturing consent
to agree with this
and that opposite to what someone who
died recently said there is an
alternative and certainly several so
there is a message of Hope there my hope
each time I come here and I meet with
these great colleagues here at Harvard
and when I visit gnome regularly is that
I find people who still believe it is
possible to make this world a better
place I think that Paulo FR wanted to do
that and for this reason he will never
be out of the
I'm happy with
[Music]
go well I want thank thank you all for
coming um I have a feeling that uh you
remember this evening um thanks to the
great conversationalists we had here and
uh I hope some of you will read fair and
engage in some dialectic in your own
mind and some dialogue with others then
it will be a a good use of time
[Applause]
good
