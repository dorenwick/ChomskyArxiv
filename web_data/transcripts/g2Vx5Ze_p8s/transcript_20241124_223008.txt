oh
hello welcome to mindshot my name is
Philip Goff I'm a philosopher who thinks
Consciousness pervades the universe and
is a fundamental feature of it
hello welcome to mind chat
my name is Keith Frankish
I'm a philosopher who thinks that
Consciousness at least there's many
philosophers think of it
it doesn't really exist
and we're Overjoyed today to be joined
by Professor Noam Chomsky welcome to
mind chat Noam chart Professor Chomsky
pleased to be with you
well Professor Chomsky needs no
introduction uh but I'm going to
introduce him anyway uh just perform
sake
he is a Laureate professor of
linguistics at the University of Arizona
and an Institute professor emeritus at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology
he is a towering figure in the field of
linguistics the creator of several major
theoretical programs that have shaped
the field
is also a major figure in cognitive
science and analytic philosophy and he
was one of the pioneers of the cognitive
revolution of the 1960s
and in addition to his scientific work
he is also a highly influential social
critic and political activist
who advocates for libertarian socialism
um he's the author of more than 150
books and he's one of the most cited
Scholars alive
and in addition he is the only mind chat
guest who was on Richard Nixon's enemies
list
so welcome Professor Chomsky
fantastic thank you very much
so what we're going to do today
Professor chomsky's contributed made
major contributions in a very wide range
of areas so Keith seems to have
disappeared hopefully he'll join us
again in a moment
so Professor chomsky's made a wide range
of contributions but on mind chat we're
mainly interested in Consciousness so
what we're going to do we're going to
ask some questions to explore Professor
chomsky's unique and distinctive
perspective on the philosophical and
scientific challenges posed by
consciousness
and then
I'm going to try and persuade Professor
Chomsky that Consciousness is everywhere
and then Keith's going to try and
persuade Professor Chomsky the
Consciousness is nowhere and if we have
a little bit of time I can't resist
maybe asking a little bit about politics
towards the end but we'll see if we've
got time and maybe we can have some
audience one or two audience questions
at the end
okay as always if you like the content
of these videos please do subscribe to
the channel and the audio podcast like
the video write some comments write us a
five star review and so on thank you
very much okay let's start the
discussion ah right well um
Philip and I
um in our different ways have dedicated
much of our Lives to trying to solve the
philosophical problems surrounding
Consciousness but
if I understand right
um You Professor Chomsky think that
these problems maybe beyond the capacity
of human beings to solve
that um
their Mysteries rather than problems
that are
intellectual capacities may be not up to
the task now if that's
right if that is your view then and
that's correct then
well that means that Philip and I and
many other people have been been wasting
our time
um
is is that a fair characterization of
your view that a mysterianism about
Consciousness and uh
could you tell us a bit more about that
please no I think we should step back
a little bit and ask which questions
we're talking about
as far as I'm I mean there is by now a
conventional distinction between the
easy question and the hard question
uh
I should say that I'm not convinced that
the hard question exists
I know there are interrogative
statements that seem to formulate a hard
question but
something in the form of an
interrogative may not be a question
so if I ask
why do things happen
as the form of a question but it's not a
real question because there's no
possible answer to it
unless
formulated interrogative has possible
answers it's not a question
and
that's my feeling about the so-called
hard question so let's take a concrete
example suppose suppose you asked me uh
what was it like to see the sunset last
night
I can give a detailed answer then very
if I had the talent they could give a
very detailed answer but even with my
limited talents I could describe it in
detail that's a real question on the
other hand if you ask me what's it like
to see a sunset
I have nothing to say at all there's no
answer to that question
so it's not a it has the form of an
interrogative expression but it's like
why do things happen
it's not a real question
my feeling is that the so-called easy
and hard questions pretty much divide
along that line
there are questions that you can
formulate that have possible answers you
can try to give answers to them
there are formulations you can give that
look like questions but unless there are
at least possible answers
they're just
Expressions that have the form of
interrogatives
but not real questions either for
science or philosophy
and I would
I'm inclined
to think in reading the literature
that that's pretty much the division
between easy and hard questions
and
and writing about this so I'm not
convinced that the questions are
Mysteries at least the ones that we can
formulate that have possible answers
they seem to be within the range of
human science I think there probably are
things that aren't within that range but
I'm not convinced that this is one of
them another concern I've had about the
literature I've discussed it a little
here and there is that I think it fails
to make a what seems to me a crucial
to recognize what seems to me a crucial
thing
that
conscious what's conscious let's say
conscious decisions and so on are deeply
intermingled with unconscious mental
Acts so closely intermingled with him
that I don't think he can extract the
conscious part and have a coherent
picture and I think that's particularly
true particularly clear at least in the
area of my major concerns use of
language like take what we're doing now
hmm
I made it I'm making a decision to
produce a particular sentence
I have no awareness of when I decided to
make that decision it just happened I
don't even know what sentence I'm
producing until I hear it
so there's
I think there was a decision
but
deep in the realm of the unconscious and
inaccessible hypnosis
well here there are questions we can ask
can we work out the mental acts that are
taking place when we
choose to select a sentence
can we find the areas of the brain that
are
involved in those activities
and those domains we can
make make a degree of progress in fact I
think there is progress both in working
out the nature of the mental act sending
the discovery of the brain areas that
are implicated
not what the brain areas are doing
that's beyond what we understand but at
least what areas are involved
well all of that is
the easy question if you like but it's
one that intermingles
conscious and unconscious in such a way
that you really can't extricate the
conscious fact in fact if you try to
introspect
about
what we call I mean most of your use of
language almost 100 99 of it is just
internal and it's uh
psychologically impossible to empty your
mind and not think about something
maybe you know Buddhists can do it but I
can't uh the
uh
and when you think about what your
what you what we call Inner speech
thinking to yourself
we discover very quickly it's not inner
it's not internals it's not the internal
workings of the language
it's external speech where you're not
using the articulatory system so it's a
peripheral system what's going on inside
there's good evidence we can speak it to
ourselves it's beyond consciousness
and if we look more closely you can do
the introspection yourself it seems to
me we don't really uh in our speech is
not actually sentences it's little bits
of fragments that come to our mind
and it's all done
instantaneously so quickly can't imagine
how it's done this way beyond the speech
the speed of neural transmission group
example so all kinds of things are
happening
unconsciously little bits and fragments
come to Consciousness we can study
in the usual way of the Sciences
indirectly what the mental acts are that
are underlying all of this and to an
extent how the brain is implicated but
beyond that I just don't see what we can
say I don't know how to formulate
questions that have answers
it's roughly the way it looks to me
well that's a perspective that I myself
very sympathetic to indeed I maybe say a
little bit more about my perspective
later but um well maybe this will be a
point that would Philip like to come in
there to
I mean you you you definitely think
there are
that there are uh problem real problems
Beyond these the easy ones
um well
yeah maybe when I try and persuade you
to be a pan psychist maybe I could in
line with trying to do that maybe right
suggest
um positive answers to the questions but
what I wanted to ask first actually was
about dualism so for those who don't
know dualism is the view that
Consciousness is non-physical outside of
the workings of the body and the Brain
maybe in the soul
and the philosopher Gilbert Ryle
famously mocked dualism as belief in a
ghost in the machine
but I really loved Professor Chomsky
your Twist on this
so you reject dualism if I understand
but not because you're worried by
machines being haunted by ghosts as such
but more and I quote
your worry is that Newton
exercised the machine but left the ghost
completely intact so it's a it's a
really cool quote could you maybe
explain
a little bit about what what you
intended here
and I should say this is quite a
heterodox position so
it's my view
if you look at the history of this topic
uh we're not talking History of Science
there was
the Galilee what we call the Galilean
Revolution was based on a fairly clear
conception of what physical is that had
a conception of the physical
no distinction between physical material
body it's all the same thing it wasn't
precise but it was reasonably clear
called the mechanical philosophy
philosophy of course meant science in
those things so mechanical science
and the picture was that
an intelligible explanation would have
to be within the framework of mechanical
science
mechanical science meant
something like these
artifacts that were being developed all
over Europe at the time skilled Artisans
were constructing amazing things that
looked cute looked real you know Gardens
at Versailles and mechanical clocks and
plays and so on it's kind of a little
bit like what you hear from Silicon
Valley today are these things really
alive sentience and so on but about at
the same level but they we now have a
couple hundred years of understanding
why this doesn't make any sense but
that was the picture of matter
it was held by just about every serious
scientist go there
the founders of the Royal Society
Hawkins and leibnized Newton all took
this for granted Descartes of course and
Descartes dualism in my opinion is kind
of misunderstood
seems to me Descartes dualism was
ordinary science
simple normal science
he thought he could show that just about
everything in the world including most
of human behavior and Sensibility could
be accounted for within mechanical
science
but he notices there were things that
couldn't be accounted for this ring and
it was basically correct
one of them which interests me
particularly is what's come to be called
the creative aspect of language use
affected ordinary normal language use is
unbounded and Innovative creative
you may be in Cartesian terms incited
and inclined to speak in certain ways
but you're not compelled
it's uh he thought this was essential to
humans and the most dramatic case of it
was language this was followed up by the
what we call the minor cartesians people
don't read them but I think they're very
interesting now people like Jack the
court of Juan who developed a pretty
sophisticated version of what's nowadays
called the touring test is that if some
creature that looks like us can
respond appropriately to any question we
can put to him uh it would only be
reasonable to assume that he has this
property that goes beyond mechanism
well if you have something that goes
outside the framework of
the set of assumptions you have have to
postulate a new principle that's race
kogi times
so he says yes there's another principle
in addition to the mechanical principle
then you ask how are they connected in a
into this business the pituitary plan
and so on and so forth but that's all
straight science perfectly reasonable
science
then Newton came along and if you take a
look at the principia a lot of it is
physical explanations don't work
Newton regarded this as in his words
absurd
and he said the conclusions he's
reaching are totally absurd but they
seem to be true
it's generally assumed by historians of
science that
Newton called his work principia
mathematically not principles of
philosophy for the reasons he explained
he said he has no explanation
he has no
scientific explanation
that's the fit context for who's being
famous
I I make no hypotheses coming it is I
can describe I have a mathematical
theory that describes the things but I
have no scientific theory in fact he
spent the rest of his life trying to
find some
physical basis but he would call
physical basis within mechanical
philosophy well where do we end up from
this
uh what happened I think is significant
Newton's Newton Enlightenment it's the
hoygens the rest regarded Newton's
theory is ridiculous not just as he
himself did he argued that they argued
he's reinstating occult ideas the hated
ideas of the neoscholastics Newton
agreed that he said that his occult
ideas are different because he had a
mathematical Theory
and the mathematical theory was
intelligible like leibniz understood the
theory just both he and Newton regarded
it as observed but they understood it
but I think what happened in the history
of science is that the goals were
restricted
instead of trying to find an
intelligible World whatever that is you
look for intelligible theories
look Newton's or the plus the
developments the gym leader and anything
is acceptable
as long as it's part of the mathematical
Theory uh forces and Fields
later more exotic things when you get to
quantum mechanics and so on whatever you
postulate and the best theory that
that's all we can say about the body
well John Locke understood this very
quickly
immediately after principia appeared in
a couple of years
he came out with what uh
called Lux hypothesis
extracting it from its theological
framework it comes down to me and
essentially that
thinking
anything mental it's just some aspect of
organized properties in the brain
I think that's where we are now
uh that
exercised the machine that had left the
ghost intact
then you go through the 18th century
there's a lot of serious work on this uh
culminating in Joseph priestley's work
into the century were he tries to
develop this and
fair amount of detail it was then
forgotten
literally
and it was revised in the late 20th
century
with the idea that this radical new idea
and philosophy of mind maybe
a philosophy of students maybe your mind
is just some property of the brain
and if you look at the late 20th century
the pronouncements they are almost
identical with late 18th century I mean
there's a Hiatus there which is
something to learn from so going back to
Gilbert Ryle who of course I studied
when I was a student
felt right away that there was something
wrong as I learned more about the
history of science I think you can see
what it is it's the opposite of what he
said
there's not a ghost in the machine
there's a ghost and there's no machine
the machine is whatever exists in the
world
I mean if it turns out that say John
Wheeler that the Institute of advanced
studies
suggests the theory that's called it
from bit
the only thing that exists are the
answers to questions we posed To Nature
that's it everything else that's
mattered there's nothing else to say
about it well I'm not confident this
that's right or wrong but physicists
take it seriously so I presume it's at
least possible I suppose it turns out to
be true okay that's what matter is
uh because we know nothing and this
comes up in the car as government as you
both know better than I do in the
Consciousness literature Century the
Arthur Readington Russell and so on and
see we don't know anything about matter
so we have no reason to say that matter
isn't conscious
that's actually a
extension of what Newton himself said
and since we know nothing about matter
maybe matters all matters of Life see we
can't show that it isn't it didn't
accept it but he said you can't show
that it isn't because we don't know what
matter is
so contrary to Royal matter was
exercised
it just is whatever the best theory
tells us it is
what you can do it's uh at this point
you do enter the domain where you can
distinguish
possible
problems for humans versus mysteries for
humans
this is considered an exotic idea but
it's called mysterianism to me is what
we call truism uh if we're part of the
organic world not Angels then we'll be
like every other organism
or cognitive capacities will have scope
and limits in effect they're closely
related
it's the intrinsic properties
there are built-in properties innate
properties that determine the scope but
they immediately give limits as soon as
you look at them you see this in the
language area of my area
I find impossible languages as soon as
you begin to understand what language
that's fascinating so so for you the
problem of Consciousness the hard
problem of Consciousness is is a
non-problem because there are no
conceivable positive answers
so let me try and persuade you of a
positive answer and I think it's one
that connects with a lot of what you've
just been talking about Bertrand Russell
Arthur Eddington so I I think we have a
lot in common I I agree with you
that we can't articulate the question
in the language of physical science the
way I put it I don't think you can
articulate the qualities of our
experience what it's like to see red for
example those qualities in the purely
quantitative language of physical
science
uh and for those for that reason I don't
think you can give an intelligible
explanation of Consciousness in the
terms of physical science if you can't
even articulate the phenomenon then you
can't explain it however
I don't think that's the only option
right so yes I so I think we can't
explain Consciousness in terms of matter
but I'm optimistic that maybe we can
explain matter in terms of Consciousness
so the thought would be if we just
postulate at the fundamental level of
reality
uh very s networks of very simple
conscious entities
behaving in simple predictable ways
because they have very simple forms of
experience
through their interactions realizing
certain mathematical structures
and then the next move would be to
identify those mathematical structures
with the mathematical structures of
physics so in this way we get physics
out of Consciousness so maybe we can't
get Consciousness out of physics
but maybe we can get physics out of
Consciousness and this links nicely to
what you were saying because I think the
reason this is possible is because as
Bertrand Russell pointed out
we don't know what the hell Mata is all
we have is this mathematical description
so as long as there's something at the
fundamental level of reality
that realizes that mathematical
structure may be networks of conscious
entities we can get physics out of it so
why isn't that a positive answer to the
question a positive solution to the hard
problem of consciousness
well that's surfing following you
correctly that's basically Russell a
century ago
analysis of matter which
to me is sounds like the very plausible
approach but I'd interpret it a little
differently
first of all just a qualification on
seeing bread
I don't think we can describe answer the
question what's it like to see red I can
answer the question
what's it like to see this red spot in
front of me
that I can answer but if you say what
it's like to see red I have no idea what
the answer could be
it doesn't it seems to me like one of
these non-questions in an interrogative
form and as I said before I
have the suspicion that the easy hard
problem distinction
probably lies right there
permeable questions through which there
are possible answers things that look
like questions but have no answers so
they're not really questions
let's hear it back to Wittgenstein and
the Fly bottle I think but the
um as for Russell the way I understood
what he was saying is this maybe it's
the same as what you're saying he said
the thing where
most confident about is our immediate
consciousness
the rest of our intellectual activities
are
an effort to make some sense out of it
as inquiring individuals so yes in that
sense physics comes from consciousness
uh we try to construct
some conception to the world best theory
we can of the world which will yield
answers to the questions
that we can ask about Consciousness not
to those that we can't ask that's where
the distinction comes
but then we're down to the so-called
easy questions
and in fact one of the things we
discover right away that our
Consciousness is
misleading us about the world
so you look at the bent stick and the in
the water and glass of water okay your
Consciousness is misleading you about
the world so they were confident about
our Consciousness it's not telling us
what the world is
go back to
my favorite Century again 17th century
uh experience conforms to the modes of
cognition
rough code words I think an
underappreciated philosophy this is uh
so we we are very confident about it but
we discover in our inquiries that we're
confident about the wrong thing uh not
of course there's wrong we do see the
bent state but it's not what's happening
the actual world is something different
there but theory is telling us but then
I I don't think it leads us
to the conclusion the pen second
conclusion
uh ill instrucson reaches that
conclusion by an argument against uh
radically emergence
but I never found that argument very
convincing
that I I take the simple-minded view
that I'm conscious maybe my dog is but
the table in front of me isn't
I can't prove that but I don't see any
argument against
yeah I actually agree with you about
Galen strawson's argument gaydenstrassen
was actually my PhD supervisor but I I
I'm actually my first publication was
rejecting his argument for pan psychism
so Galen justifies pan psychism
from this intuition that you can't get
Consciousness out of non-consciousness
and so we just need Consciousness there
from the start
I agree with you that I I don't buy that
intuition
um I don't see why there couldn't be
strange properties the armed
Consciousness but somehow make
Consciousness so I don't by the the
strawson argument but I think that my
argument for pan psychism again is
closely connected to things you've just
said I would make more of a Simplicity
argument
as you said the the only thing we really
can be confident of the existence of is
consciousness through our immediate
awareness of our feelings and
experiences so if we can account for
everything we want to account for just
with Consciousness then that's the most
simple elegant parsimonious Theory
that's the one we should go for and I
think we can because physics is purely
mathematical
we can simply postulate
networks of conscious entities that
realize the structures of physics
we can account for physics
um and so there's never a need to
postulate anything beyond Consciousness
so finally I I think I agree with you
that maybe the normal way of putting the
problem of Consciousness is maybe a
non-question where we're trying to
explain away consciousness
but
to my mind the Bertrand Russell approach
turns the hard problem of Consciousness
on its head so instead of trying to
explain away Consciousness in terms of
matter
we try to explain away matter in terms
of Consciousness and that looks to me
the most simple parsimonious way of
accounting for all the data and so the
theory that's
most likely to be true we can never know
for sure we can't look inside a particle
and and see whether it's conscious or
not just as I can't look inside your
brain and see whether you're conscious
or not but we should give highest
Credence to the to the simplest Theory
that accounts for all the data and that
seems to me pansychism
well I agree with you that we should
look for the sentence Theory
but it should be the
ory that accounts for the whole range of
evidence
and it seems to me when you look at the
whole range of evidence
it's a different picture
we
I'm confident that I'm conscious
the easy quit so-called easy question
you can study it and find out what's
going on in my brain when I'm conscious
okay and what's going on in it
you know what's not happening in the
table let's say well that's evidence too
now we want the simplest theory for all
of this and the simplest theory for all
of this I think comes down to saying I'm
conscious my table isn't not so sure
about my when you say
fish or something else maybe but that's
going to be answered by the theory of
what's going on when you actually have
Consciousness so if I think if we extend
the range of the evidence
to
all that the scientific work that gives
us some
indication of what the neural basis is
for Consciousness we want the simplest
theory that accounts for all of this
and it does distinguish me from the
table
then we want so I think we end up with a
picture that
we can work on the easy question which
is of course very hard and get
pretty good answers to lots of aspects
of it then we can try to develop the
simplest theory of all of this
it seems to me it does make distinctions
between me and the table
let me have one more try at this
um
it almost starts you know it's almost
sounding like now you're saying we do
know what matter is and we know
some of it doesn't involve Consciousness
but what I take from uh Bertrand Russell
the analysis of matter is we have no
idea what matter is all we know is what
it does it's abstract mathematical
structure so therefore the alternative
to pansychism
is just to postulate that the matter
outside of brains has some completely
unknown nature
that we know not which as John Locke
said he's just got some completely
unknown nature whereas
surely if if the only thing we know
about Mata is that some of it
the stuff in brains has a Consciousness
involving nature matter outside of
brains who are completely in the dark
about surely that the simplest
hypothesis is to suppose the stuff
outside of brains has a as a nature
continuous with the stuff inside of
brains
well I think that
taking too literally the general
statements by Locke and Newton and
others yes we don't know what matter is
but then when we investigate we can
develop theories of what the world is
like those are our best theories okay
the matter is whatever best theories
tell us it is can't be certain about it
it's an empirical inquiry so you never
gonna have certainty that's science but
we can have theories that look better
than others and when we look into the
neural correlates of Consciousness what
happens when you're asleep under drugs
all this kind of stuff then we can
develop
the best theory
and of what's going on when we have the
experience of Consciousness then that
tells us distinguishes me from the table
you know when you say we don't know have
any idea that means well we can't be
certain there could be other things that
we don't know about but that's true of
science generally I don't think it's has
any special
um the grasp and this particular branch
of science it's just you do the best you
can
get the best theory you can that
accounts for whatever is around well
there is evidence about what's going on
in the brain when some creature is or is
not conscious so let's take that to be
our best guess for now as to what matter
is
you can still say well I really don't
know in fact
friend of mine
Quantum theorist and send me a article
in a quantum theory Journal a couple
months ago which was a
discussion among
Hotshot on zeros about where a particle
is and they can't agree and they don't
know what a particle is but that doesn't
mean we know nothing
they agree on a lot of the properties
are part of this just don't know maybe
it's right it's good deep enough to end
up with kind of like what Richard
Feynman said about Quantum Theory
because we know how to use it but nobody
understands it and so you go deep enough
you get to a point where you don't
understand anyone but that doesn't mean
you know nothing
the path that Russell suggests is from
Consciousness to what he called a causal
Theory of the world
well he
as you know he was criticized for that
mathematician Newman I think Russell
gave it up much too quickly because it
assumed that there was no uh phenomenon
that was no perceptual evidence
and he doesn't have to assume that he
could say well it's at least what
Eddington called meter reading so yes
you don't have some basis in perception
but then the counter arguments so I
think he could maintain the
conception of science giving as a
basically causal theory of the world but
that's something it's not nothing
it's our best guess as to what matters
what satisfies this causal theory of the
world and then when we include that in
the book of evidence for which we're
trying to develop the simplest Theory
seems to me it does make a distinction
between me and the table or the brain
you can see the brain is whatever matter
is
thinking is some aspect of whatever
matter is is located and
we don't have any notion of physical
anymore it's just whatever there is
okay but that includes the mind with
Foods Consciousness
some
Arabesque theories Aid the properties of
it show up in some areas not other areas
like in my behavior but not what the
table does
I'd love to talk about Newman's critique
of Russell but we're going on I think
I've had my go at trying to persuade you
to be a Panasonic is Keith can you can
you do any better
um okay let me have a shot let me see if
I can
I convert to be in it what I call an
Illusionist uh don't build too much into
the term
the general idea is that we're confused
about what Consciousness is or at least
a lot of philosophers are confused about
what Consciousness is
um the introspection misleads us I I
think introspection is as fallible as
perception it's a psychological faculty
it's not got any uh wonderful magical
powers uh to acquainters with a a a a a
a a special Realm Of Consciousness it's
just another site another thing the
brain does
and uh I think we we it gives us a
confused idea of Consciousness we think
of
Consciousness we we talk about what
experience is like with this is a common
way of talking is that that pain was
horrible that that taste is delicious we
talk about what experiences like
and that induces us to think that we're
referring to private mental qualities
what it what it is like this is
whatever that are sort of presented to
us in a mental realm so there's there's
the the they say the coffee we're
tasting but that has some properties but
then that creates taste quietly out in
our minds and we're we're aware of the
taste of the coffee via our awareness or
uh uh uh of these taste qualia or these
taste quality are accompany our
awareness of the of the coffee
and so it's like a show in a in a
private theater where where these
properties are presented to the self and
that's consciousness
and uh and these these qualities are
really strange ones they're supposed to
be intrinsic they're they're distinct
from all psychological reactions and
responses you could have all the
reactions and responses without that
particular intrinsic fee or the feels an
added extra
and they're supposed to be radically
private they exist only for for the the
observing self in the theater no one
else can can detect them and they're
ineffable can't describe them they have
this unique
epistemic status that reveal themselves
directly to the self and so on and once
you think of Consciousness in that way
then then you really have created a hard
problem for yourself an insoluble
problem uh and you've you've put
Consciousness outside the reach of
experimental science there's there's no
way you can do science on private
ineffable intrinsic properties like that
it's like conceiving of life as some
vital spark in addition to all the
organic processes
people used to think of life like that
and maybe there are reasons uh natural
reasons why they thought of life in that
way but no no it's a bad way to think of
it it's life's just a collection of
Highly complex organic processes
and
the illusionists say stop thinking of
Consciousness in that way stop creating
an insoluble problem for yourself
um they say Consciousness doesn't
involve awareness of private mental
qualities it involves awareness of
features of the world and
our own reactions to those features of
the world our awareness of the world is
colored by our reactions to it our
psychological reactions to it and the
reason we think there's this private in
a show is because of the Limited
introspective access we have to all
those complex
psychological reactions stimuli
uh impact upon us and they create a host
of psychological reactions and we have a
vague sense of this of there being a
sort of internal richness
um a richness of a psychological
richness a richness of processes but we
we can't articulate this and so we just
gesture at it by talking about what
experiences is like and then the mistake
is to reify that notion of what it's
like
into what it is likenesses and where do
these what is what are these what it is
likenesses and how does the brain
produce them and maybe their fundamental
features of all reality and and so on as
pancitis say so uh
it's a kind of Illusion this this this
this this this the notion of
Consciousness that
pancitis and dualists are working with
it is is is a a
bad one based on
that arises from the limitations of
introspection and we should discard it
and as you said simply focus on the easy
problems the problems of explaining what
the processes that occur during episodes
of experience
so that's that's
roughly the picture
uh do you think it misses anything out I
think is the question well I am
partially sympathetic that for reasons I
mentioned
so in the
areas where I mainly work say language
as I said I think there are there's
inner penetration of what we're aware of
and things we can't be aware of which
play a major role in what we call
experience
but it doesn't seem to me that that
gives us a reason to cast out one
element of this psychological reactions
that we have namely
I see that the color red in the
upper left of my visual field and here's
what it looks like that seems to be one
of the psychological reactions whatever
one wants to call it I could call it
Consciousness call it something else but
it's part of the network of
psychological reactions which we
constantly had
a good name for it is consciousness but
I don't see how to extricate it from all
the others with that in that regard I
agree with you but it doesn't
I I don't see what we have to I don't
see any reason and I think you agree and
not to accept it as part of the general
network of reactions
then comes what amounts to a
terminological question are we going to
call it consciousness
well there's so much weight that's been
cast upon the concept of Consciousness
and the philosophical discussion of
mostly this Century that maybe we need
better terms
actually I think it's mostly this
century
until
the 20th century there was very little
talk about
conscious conscious except
self-consciousness it was a lot about
that but not
and
as I mentioned in
one of the papers they sent around
was always struck by the fact that this
contemporary debate
seems to exclude the one
serious effort
to develop a
a real theory of appearance Nelson
Goodman's
actually I was his student so um I was
an undergrad studying with him at the
time he was working on the book
structure of appearance
and
couldn't I don't think it reaches a
James but it is
a serious constructive effort to develop
a theory of what appearance is from
elementary quality so I think in order
to enter into discussion somewhere but
the general point I think is yes we have
lots of psychological reactions going on
all the time
some of them
fall into what has been called
Consciousness like
my seeing you know people in front of me
as Descartes pointed out you're not
seeing people in Trinity you've seen
spots and lines and so on we now know a
lot more about that but my Consciousness
in his people something my mind
constructs from data that's coming in uh
Arabesque theories tell us something
about what the data might be
soon
I think the picture is
attractive but I don't it doesn't seem
to me to lead to the conclusion that we
have to excise consciousness
and cast it out from the network of
psychological reactions and it's always
a conception of Consciousness tend to
agree with Russell that it's the part
that we're most confident about even
though when we look at it we find that
it's not telling us what the world is
can I press you on that point about the
thing we're most certain of I mean in a
sense we can say yes this is happening
now whatever it is and I'm certain this
is happening without having any
uh
assurance and the way we conceptualize
what is happening now
and would you say that our introspective
reports and judgments that they too are
constructed
by the brain by the similar sort of
processes to the ones in which are
perceptual reports and judgments are
constructed
and if so doesn't that mean they've had
the same possibility of being fallible
distorting
caricatured
uh I mean access to our own minds to our
own Consciousness and that's not
magically assured
well I think
what our Consciousness tells us about
the world is fallible and in fact wrong
but that's different from saying that
the Consciousness is failable so when I
see the bent stick I see the Bend State
happens it isn't bent but that's going
back to Russell when you try to create
the best theory you can for what seems
to you
not valuable you just discovered that
your own experiences failable
it's not conforming to the World As for
the fact that it's first person not
third person mind
I don't know how significant that is I
mean from a third person point of view
you can get plenty of evidence about
when I'm conscious and what I'm
conscious about if we knew enough about
the easy question which we don't it
might be possible by looking at the
brain to say he's seeing the red spot in
the upper part of the visual field then
from a third person point of view you
wouldn't have the same you wouldn't be
seeing it but you'd understand what it
means to be seen
so that would answer all the what it's
like questions that can be answered a
lot I can't be answered so they're not
real questions no I I yeah that I yes
I'm totally important that we can we can
be sure of Consciousness as a process
that something is happening that is
constructing a certain picture of the
world for us I think the the question is
whether we have some insight into the
nature of that process and what it
involves and that it involves as
dualism and psychics think some the
presence of some strange qualities the
what it is likenesses that are
distinctively mental and that are mental
versions of the colors and other
qualities we ascribe to things around us
in the world and I think that is a is
going Way Beyond what we're certain I
think that's a theoretical
interpretation of the process of
conscious awareness
that leads us down a dead end so we
certainly sure that we're being we're
aware of stuff valibly aware and stuff
but I don't think that fallible
awareness of the world is rooted in an
infallible awareness of a private inner
world I think that's just multiplying
entities Beyond necessity
I don't think we have to postulate an
inner world
we don't need a Cartesian theater or we
don't like any of that stuff all we need
is here's one of my psychological
reactions there's a spotter right up
there and here's what it looks like that
I can describe it in detail that's part
of my whole psychology
usual name for that it's Consciousness
you want a different name yeah and it
doesn't tell us about the I mean we the
following Russells program the study of
the causal structure of the world tells
us the actual world the one that our
best theories tell us about doesn't
conform to my experience but
worth
experienced constructed by
paramus's cognition they enter into what
the outside world is telling us and they
yield experience which is it's there but
it's not telling us about the telling us
only indirectly about the world
I think if we sort these things out we
don't have to go into the dead end that
you're describing
it's my feeling right well I'm
I'm on board with all that I think as
you say there's a terminological issues
but um and presentational issues but
picture of sketch there seems pretty
congenial to me um
so who do you think's more right or less
wrong Professor Chomsky or are we both
totally wrong
do you think me or Keith is
your book written interest in the
article I think there are ways of
reframing them
so that they're consistent
all right there you go Philip we've been
arguing all this time Keith and maybe
our views are consistent
uh but it's been fascinating discussion
do we have time maybe for a quick
question about politics and maybe one or
two audience questions yeah so
so we're supposed to be a Consciousness
podcast but I'm very much a political
animal so I can't resist taking the
opportunity
um
you're actually almost exactly 50 years
older than me Professor Chomsky I I was
born in the winter of discontent at the
end of the 70s that swept Margaret
Thatcher into power so I I always think
of my lifetime as the time when
everything went
because you know in the post-war years
we had relatively well regulated
capitalism
uh in the U.S Western Europe
high taxes of 80 or 90 percent on the
wealthy in the U.S and the UK and you
know this made at least in
in uh this part of the world uh Society
is more equal and uh also very high
levels of growth and then
from my birth onwards we've got uh you
know the regulation and the taxes
slashed and we've got massive inequality
2008 meltdown and it was all your fault
I know the decade of brexit and Trump
and all the rest of it so so I tend to
get quite
miserable and thinking there's no hope
probably because my existence is
co-extensive with this terrible
neoliberal period so I wanted to ask
given your um broader perspective living
over twice as long as me
whether you have hope that
we are perhaps coming to the end of the
neoliberal era and that
um perhaps there is can be some hope
that we'll move on to to some better
economic model do you see any any up any
grounds for optimism at all
here
yeah I have one of the advantages of
being in my mid-90s
so I actually experienced this before in
childhood you go back to the 1920s
pretty similar to today
Thatcher and Reagan have succeeded in
driving
countries that spread over the world
started in the U.S and Britain driving
them back to the worst of the 1920s
extreme inequality uh destruction of the
labor move and notice that both Reagan
and Thatcher understood where their
advisors understood that if you're going
to carry out
uh
harsh class Ward you've got to eliminate
the defenses
people can't be allowed to defend
themselves so their First Act was to
destroy labor unions opened the door to
the corporate sector to go ahead and
then comes highway robbery on an
extraordinary scale
I mean in the United States it's
actually been studied I don't know about
Britain so the Brand Corporation very
respectable Corporation about a year ago
came out with a detailed study of
what they call the transfer of wealth
from the general population to the top
one percent during these 40 Years of
class war
roughly 50 trillion dollars
that's pretty impressive Highway Robert
now Thatcher's line was
as you recall there's no Society just
individuals in the market
maybe she believed it I don't know but
it's total nonsense there's a very rich
Society for the wealthy and privilege
Chambers of Commerce trade associations
Business Roundtable even the government
which they mostly run so they have
enormous support system and which end up
with is what's sometimes being called a
bailout economy
the very rich and Powerful are protected
by a huge network of associations the
rest of the population is tossed out in
the market to survive some now well what
do you end up with 50 trillion dollars
of robbery destruction of democracy
elimination of benefits I mean what's
going on in England this is almost
surreal
England had the best Health Service in
the world
NHS was the ideal for the world
I've been trying to turn it into the
worst system in the world the U.S system
twice the cost of comparable countries
uh some of the worst outcomes
in fact the United States the only
country outside of War where mortalities
increasing
to
especially the Tory government but labor
wasn't much different are saying let's
take the best system dismantle it turn
it into the worst distance well that's
class war
in a very effective way let's go back to
the 20s that's what had happened
in the United States Woodrow Wilson's
Red Scare had destroyed the pretty
vibrant effective labor movement
silenced critical thought it was a
brutal repression you get the 20s a lot
of euphoria I mean even spread down to
the lower middle class like my father
an immigrant you know
he bought some he got caught up in his
real estate speculation when there was
all the story about him become rich by
buying real estate they bought a
particle of land which turned out to be
in the Mid-Atlantic somewhere okay that
was the 1920s 1930s it all changed
revised they remove and Rewind and
Industrial actions militant actions a
lot of political activism by now we're
up to the period I remembered
he got the New Deal in the United States
which forged the way to social democracy
in the western world
okay the question did happen again
in fact we have a
not bad models where you mentioned the
regulated capitalism of the 50s and the
60s it's pretty economists called the
Golden Age of capitalism
far from perfect kind of things that
were wrong but his comparison with the
class war of the last 40 years it was
pretty successful
well at the very least you can go back
to that but then you can go Way Beyond
then so much more just much more free
societies
it's a battle but it's always been a
battle it was a battle in the 1930s okay
it is today
that's great that's given me lots of
grounds for for Hope and and you know in
many ways I think you know what gives me
hope is I think I feel in the 2008
crisis the but the left was was was too
weak to sort of take take advantage of
that crisis as it were and explain and
give us a way forward but I think I feel
in the decade or so since then the sort
of intellectual infrastructure has um
built up a lot more there are a lot of
um
independent news channels and magazines
and there's a lot more going on it feels
like hopefully we can start to
articulate A Better Way Forward but
anyway sorry I'm I said that would be
one question but that's that's given me
some grounds for help for Hope and help
um maybe just uh one or two audience
questions
um
if I scroll back a little bit sorry
we're using new software now
um okay digital gnosis got in first to
Friend of the show another philosophy
podcast asks
would linguistic reform around
consciousness
this rarefied thing help us do away
these mysterious problems of mind if so
what linguistic uses
in discourse on mind should we encourage
did you get that Professor Chomsky
pretty none
hey
as some of you don't know I'm not
hearing anything I'm reading the
transcript and sometimes
um maybe I what I could do is put the
question in the chat can you see the
chat can you see that okay there we go
there's the question
foreign
around Consciousness reified thing help
us do anyway with these mysterious
problems of mind if so what linguistic
uses in discourse online should we
encourage
well I think there's something to that
as we were discussing the
there's been a lot of baggage associated
with Consciousness in the last
covered
and I think we can my feeling is we can
take it apart reformulate it in simple
terms and
eliminate a good deal of what seems to
be mysterious
so I think we can say
we have all kinds of we live in a
complex domain of psychological
reactions all sorts of things are going
on a lot of them were not conscious of
critical to what we do something as
simple as deciding to produce this
sentence and not some other one totally
beyond the level of Consciousness that's
true of what we're doing all our lives
we can learn something about it
following the path
of the so-called easy question Brussels
past trying to construct the best theory
to deal with whatever data we have some
of it in this network of psychological
reactions there are some that have
special properties like I see a red spot
what I take to be I have the experience
to read up in that corner of my visual
field okay what's actually happening
when you look is they're psychatic eye
movements and a little bit of stimuli
are being picked up here and there my
mind is doing all kind of complicated
things including uh interpreting
the signals to say and they're making up
they want to see a red spot well all of
that's going on we can study all of it
doesn't change the fact that there are
some things that have this property of
infallibility it just puts them in a
broader context as for the dualism I my
own feeling is that that was cast out
centuries ago we just don't know uh we
know there are mental we assume that
actually even this is a hypothesis we
assume there are mental processes we're
remember
descendi's critique of Descartes which
get to the center of it and criticize
the kogito by saying it doesn't tell you
anything about anybody existing
just as thinking's going on
well deciding's going on thinking is
going on
in our efforts to make some sense of it
we may postulate a self but it doesn't
mean it's there it's just all these
things going on
we built up our best conception of them
but the Human Condition we can carry out
experimental or we can find what we take
to be neural correlates of the things
we're looking at
I think we end up with a system that's
kind of if you like sort of complicated
it's just the way science is it's the
way all the rest of science is
okay maybe one more question this the
next question on Consciousness came from
scrutova who's a friend of the show who
says do you think that language is one
of the requirements for consciousness
I think the language is one of the
requirements for Consciousness well yeah
as you may have noticed I'm a kind of an
old-fashioned conservative
and I believe
what was basically
proposed by
Classical Greece Aristotle most
explicitly classical India yet there's
no way of distinguishing language and
thought they're basically the same thing
the language is what constructs thought
in any sense in which we understand the
term is what's constructed by language
so I don't think
languages
one of the requirements for
Consciousness only in the sense the
thought is
if we're not an organism that
can propose questions reflect on them
propose answers there's nothing there's
no questions that there's nothing to say
about the consciousness
you can't even close a pose a question
about him
well thank you very much we've taken
over an hour of your time it's been
absolutely stimulating discussion we're
very grateful to taking
some time to spend discussing these
crucial issues with us thank you
thank you very much
um
thank you well we'll end the stream and
if you want to hang around for 30
seconds we could say goodbye Upstream
but how we know how we normally finish
is to eat just your attention that even
though Keith and I and yourself
Professor Johnson disagree on many
things one thing we can certainly agree
on is that Consciousness is wherever it
is
and nowhere else
