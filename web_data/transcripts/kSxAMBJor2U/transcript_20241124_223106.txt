good evening uh imad
good evening uh frank nice to see you
again
same um i was gonna say uh we waiting
for professor chomsky to join us which
is obviously uh
an honor for for both of us um so your
name is imad al-sus
you are from gaza your research fellow
at the max planck institute in germany
and and your field of research strongly
focuses on hamas
and we spoke about ten days ago we had
an interview um i'll share the link
by the way uh again uh on hamas and on
in a way talking about the facts what's
hamas what's behind the
ideology of hamas um and at the end of
the conversation um
i mentioned that i worked on a book with
nom chomsky and
and you told me sort of a quick story on
on why
you'd love to actually talk to nom
chomsky so can you can you tell tell us
again
what was the story in a way yeah because
my
academic journey is always the chomsky
is there and he's inspiring me
i remember in my ba i did uh i did it in
english language and literature in
berkshire university in ramallah
and i remember chomsky was an important
philosopher of language and i used his
generative approach
uh to examine first language acquisition
for my graduate seminar from the
university
but also when i went to my master's to
study international relations
he also inspired me as a critical event
of theory
of international relations and i
remember he said it's easier
to understand international relations if
you read about mafia theories rather
than this
international relations but also what's
important about
professor chomsky as a philosopher and
as academic how he want to materialize
his knowledge
in order to be in favor of the oppressed
and the happiness
and this linkage between the oppressed
and academia
inspired me like for example in the past
the suffering of the jewish people
and in the present and the last 73 years
of the palestinians
and this is why the chomsky has been
inspiring people like me and
millions around the world oh
he's here fantastic oh super
professor chomsky hello professor
chomsky
how are you we're good can you hear me
perfect okay anyway and we're very happy
to obviously
talk to you again and it's uh and thanks
again for
you know having sort of taking the time
to um to do this
very glad to be with you okay i
can't use the right computer because
it's not working but
that's what manager i guess yeah it's
nice it's great the picture is nice the
sound is great
so let's start right okay
okay so uh
hello professor chomsky um hello imad
we we just had a quick introduction for
for imad
professor chomsky i wanted to to start
with you um
about the recent gaza war
there's been a cease fire for now um
mediated by egypt
and um between israel and hamas so
what's next for you now for for
palestine and for hamas
and for gaza sorry
well we have to there are fundamental
problems
the fundament the basic problem is that
for 50 years israel has been
pursuing a very specific
policy it's
in the west bank it means constructing a
greater israel in which
without going into the details israel
basically takes over whatever it wants
and avoids the concentrations of
palestinian population
so that's in order to avoid what
israel calls the demographic problem
the problem of having too many non-jews
in what they like to call a democratic
jewish state and oxymoron that's
harder to mouth every year
so the idea will be they don't want to
take over nobles
or other population concentrations just
anything that's of value with regard to
gaza
in 2005 the israeli government
made the decision that to try to
maintain
settlers illegally in gaza
uh was just too expensive for them they
had a large part of the
idf israeli army defending them from
the people they were violently
oppressing
so they withdrew the settlers but
maintained the occupation
since then
[Music]
immediately there was an election
january 6 january 2006
pre-election closely monitored declared
free and fair
came out the wrong way uh did not the
way
the us and israel wanted it hamas won
the election
the uh uh
israel immediately extended
broke the relation there had been an
agreement with hamas about with the
palestinians about the
uh occupation but israel immediately
broke it and said no we're giving up on
all the things we promised you voted the
wrong way
increased sanctions increased violence
the u.s immediately launched an
operation
[Music]
to try to overturn the government by
military force
and a year later hamas
preempted the effort uh that
led to a very sharp increase in
u.s and israeli attacks on gaza
bad enough to vote the wrong way an
election but
even worse to preempt an effort to
overthrow the
government by military force and since
then
gaza has been
a horror story uh it's a prison
two million people imprisoned harsh
sanctions
constant military attacks it's kind of a
punching bag for
the idf and uh
barely survivable there isn't there's
barely even water to drink
the sewage and power plants have been
devastated by israeli attacks
so it's uh just
bear survival and constant attacks
meanwhile in the west bank israel
pursues the greater israel project
as long as this continues as long as the
west tolerates that
we're going to have repeated atrocities
and crimes
so the first step that has to be taken
is for the west to make it very clear
and explicit
that they will not tolerate these
policies
in any way it will break
any relation with any
israeli entity including the government
that sponsors the occupation
and that can be done with cancellation
of trade with cancellation of other
relations with the
boycott of multinationals that are
working on the occupation
and so on the whole at least open the
door
to a possibility to look for
possible solutions but as long as the
greater israel option
is available nothing's going to happen
thanks professor imad do you want to do
you want to quickly uh
react on what professor chomsky just
said i agree with professor chomsky
i think not only this current government
by netanyahu but all the israeli
governments they wanted to continue with
their settler colonial approach
at the expense of the palestinians and
denying their rights
and this is what for example the israeli
government in the last five six years is
doing
is trying to isolate the palestinian
cause and the palestinian questions
and denying their rights but this
latest event in gaza i i think
they didn't come in favor of israel in
two things first
it united all the palestinians in gaza
and the west bank in west jerusalem and
inside israel
and in the diaspora as one people who
suffering from settler colonialism since
73 years
this unification israel is always a try
to isolate
palestinians geographically into small
communities and not
linking to each other but also the
latest event they were able to link
between
gaza and jerusalem gaza and the west
bank
gaza and the palestinian citizen israel
who
suffer and living as a second or third
or tenth
citizen and also the palestinian in the
diaspora
this this new narrative this is a new
framework
i think not only will put the
palestinian question again on the table
and will stop the israeli narrative from
isolating the palestinian cause
but also i think there is a hope now
among the palestinians
to create a new framework or all the
palestinian disagreements
can be discussed within this framework
and then it's
a channel as one strategy to confront
the israeli
settler colonialism i think this is
maybe
one of the most important factors
regarding
this latest event between gaza
the west bank is jerusalem palestine
inside israel
again as the central colonialism of the
state of israel
thank you matt um noam i wanted to ask
you something about the us
we've seen a change at least in the
democratic party
for the first time in in decades there
are some
strong dissenting voices inside the
democratic party in the u.s
when it comes to ending u.s of the u.s
blind support for israel
what do you make of this and do you
think that in the long term it could
actually change u.s foreign policy
first of all what you're seeing is
congress is a
reflection of large-scale changes
that are taking place among the general
population
so over you go back
10 or 20 years uh israel
was the darling of uh liberal american
opinion
uh jewish non-jewish mainstream liberal
that's changed radically by now
among people who identify themselves as
liberals more or less uh there's more
support for palestinian rights than for
israel
support for israel has shifted to the
far right
to evangelicals and
uh military
the militaristic nationalistic uh wing
of the republican party
it's a big shift it's happening among
the jewish population as well
uh read this morning's
newspapers and the israeli newspapers
are to be a couple of articles about
from various points of view about the
fact that young jews are
drifting away from uh commitment to
israel which is quite true
and it's in fact even true of the
evangelical community
the recent polls of evangelicals have
shown that
the younger ones are no longer
so totally wedded to extreme support of
israel as
the general community had been so this
is a long-term process
it's been partly caused by israeli
actions
i couldn't see it very clearly if
and giving talks on these topics for
60 years until pretty recently i used to
have police protection
even at my own university after
the last couple of gaza attacks that
totally changed
cast lead was 2006 made a big difference
uh the moon just changed entirely
and uh it's other developments have
contributed to it
so the black lives matter organizing
which has been going on for years and
has
changed the background considerably
laid the basis for the explosion that
took place
after the floyd murder that's affected
other things as well
the general growing concern for issues
of
rights repression genocide
violence and so on all of that's been
spread
spreading among large parts of the
population
and it's showing up in the attitudes
towards israel
so after this latest atrocity
for the first time you saw not just in
congress
but even in the mainstream press uh
major columnists saying we have to stop
military aid israel that was unthinkable
a few years ago
it's something that's now beginning
and i think the
party leadership is of course resistant
uh they're donor-oriented
oriented towards the main
centers of power but popular opinion
can't be overlooked forever
and i think there are opportunities now
for moving towards
significant changes in u.s policy
and even a threat of change would have a
big impact on israel
it's important to recognize that back in
the 1970s
israel did have a fateful decision to
make
this was the labor party they had to
decide
whether to accept political
diplomatic settlement which was
available
uh granting essentially everything they
claim they want uh un
resolutions calling for two states
the right of each state to exist in
peace and security on the
international border israel
had to decide do we want a political
settlement
or do we want to expand
they chose to expand uh
they were backed by the united states
which featured the resolutions
and gave them support in their
expansionist
projects well that has a corollary
if you decide to choose expansion
over diplomacy and security
you're going to become a pariah state
over time there'll be moral degeneration
internally uh violence and repression
will have its
consequences internationally and they
will be more reliant on the united
states for survival
uh give up your efforts to
integrate with the local population
world more or less liberal opinion
that's what's going to happen
so now israel has basically got a choice
it can if
it is responsive to has to be responsive
to u.s policy it's
given away all the other cards if u.s
policy changes
israel can either accommodate to it
or become a small
militaristic reactionary state
allied with other brutal
ultra-reactionary
states in the region it's basically what
the abraham accords
an alliance among the most reactionary
repressive states of the region
so that's what israel chooses as its
future that's one possibility
but it will isolate itself from
western society and western opinion
u.s policy shifts i think israel will
accommodate to it
and it can shift it's a possibility for
the first time this is a
real life possibility
many thanks professor chomsky
i actually want to rebound on the
abraham
of course and maybe ask you imad
we talk about the us part in what's
happening in palestine
um but what about the arab world in
terms of the governments not the people
and what about the abrahamic course in
your opinion imad
um are they game changer or what are
they
for palestine first
okay all right yeah go ahead
i go next okay well there's several
things to notice about the abraham
accords
the one that's you you mentioned
governments
yes it's governments in the arab world
governments
have nothing to do with people these are
tyrannical
dictatorships there hold down the
population by force
now the egyptian dictatorship may be the
worst in
egypt's history is simply a violent
brutal dictatorship has maybe
at least 60 000 people in jail
harsh repression the family
dictatorships of the gulf are
some of the most repressive governments
in the world
the abraham accords brought together
this group of highly repressive
dictatorial states along with israel
in effect it took tacit arrangements
which had already existed and raised
them to the level of form of
a formal agreement
didn't basically change very much just
formalized the agreement
we should notice incidentally that it
includes morocco
that's not insignificant
if you look at the government's states
brought together in the abraham accords
they are basically the states that have
inside from israel which has the muscle
the others have
the main natural resources of the region
same is true of morocco morocco doesn't
have oil but it has
phosphates it's the basically has a near
monopoly of phosphates in the world
phosphates are irreplaceable they're
critical for agricultural production
uh morocco conquered
the western sahara much the way israel
conquered palestine uh is holding it
illegally violation of international law
but with u.s support
much like israel-palestine trump made it
explicit
that's as another step towards expanding
the phosphate monopoly
all of these things are interrelated the
abraham accords bring together
the most repressive violent states in
the region
along with the natural resources of the
region
all under the u.s aegis well that's
the abrahamic courts it's kind of
interesting that they're
celebrated by liberal opinion
almost everywhere if you look at what
they actually are that's
a little bit ironic but put that aside
anyway that's their nature for trump
and the republicans and many of the
democrats
it's part of a broader geopolitical
vision
namely bring together the world's most
reactionary brutal states
as a base for u.s power over the world
that's in the middle east it's
essentially the abraham accords
and the western hemisphere it's
bolsonaros brazil the dukecase columbia
pretty similar uh moving to the east
modi's india natural number
crushing muslim rights hundreds of
millions of people
and crushing kashmir very natural and
destroying indian secular democracy
that's
natural candidate europe it's uh
places like orbans hungary uh destroying
the democratic system so this entire
system
forged together with under washington's
aegis
would be a global base
for uh the most extreme
reactionary version of u.s power the
trump republican version
well that's all been taking shape the
abraham
words are part of this thank you
professor chomsky
uh i'd like you imad to to react and
then i'll have a final question for you
both
so imad what's your opinion on what
no i'm saying i agree with the professor
chomsky i think this
abraham occurs they are like a new
normalization between some arab regimes
and and israel but the reality it was a
long-term alliance
between the 13 regime and the settler
colonialism of palestine
and this is very clear it's not a
conspiracy anymore especially after
the arab spring in 2011 when israel
directly allied
directly with the arab authoritarian
regimes
unlike uh professor chomsky said we have
an exchange
palestine all of palestine is for israel
and western sahara for morocco
and the saudi arabian united arab
emirates they will
be with israel against
iran but in fact this is not
normalization because
because in fact this is alliance and
israel is uncovering this alliance
it exists since the 70s and with the
united arab emirates since the first
decade of the 2000
so it's nothing in you as an alliance
between dictatorships or
latino regimes in the arab world and the
settler colonialism of palestine
and and i don't call it abyss uh process
because for example united arab emirates
in bahrain they were never
in war with israel but for example if we
talk about jordan or the palestinian
authority
or egypt yes it does work to call it a
peace process between them and israel
because there there was a war between uh
between these countries
thank you imad so my my final question
is about we talked about the arab world
we talked about the us
i want to talk about public opinion
no one mentioned it i mean the last gaza
war
saw the biggest demonstrations
throughout the world
in support of palestine we also
saw celebrities very high-profile people
that never talked about palestine before
that at least on social media started to
talk about palestine
so i'll start with you professor chomsky
do you think
public opinion in a way could could sway
could sway the balance in favor of a
just
peace for the palestinians
you know is that the future in a way
i think there are real opportunities
there has been a
long-term shift in public opinion of
trying to describe
it's now reaching a point exactly like
what you mentioned uh open
overt uh support for palestinian rights
including celebrities and demonstrations
and so on
it's quite striking during the u.s
demonstrations during the
latest crimes that you didn't have
the usual counter demonstrations
they just weren't there people don't
want to be seen
it doesn't mean that the forces
disappear
they're working hard to try to prevent
this but they can't really appear in
public
public stunning against them well with
dedicated committed sensible
tactics aimed at reaching results
not just feeling good about something
yes
things could happen it's going to take
hard
serious work and careful thinking
about appropriate tactics because the
forces that want to maintain the current
system of power and repression
are very are dedicated relentless
they're going to keep working on it
they're not going away and you have to
be able to counter them with
serious work on the ground which can
change things
i think there really are opportunities
now that didn't exist before
many thanks no i'm imadel i'll give you
the the final word
if you want i i think uh what it changed
the public opinion internationally
many factors but basically i will
concentrate on too i think
we as a human being we respect the
victim when the victim resists for its
right
and the palestinian this time they
united and there is
their voice in jerusalem and gaza and
the west bank
and the diaspora inside israel to say we
are suffering since 73
years of citral colonialism but also
israel narrative of central colonialism
it was uh
protected in the media especially in the
western media
but we we had the luck as palestinians
that this jacob hitler
from new york who invaded the home of
palestinians
civilians in in jerusalem and he wanted
to steal their home
because god told him this is your home
or my his religion told him is no
uh his home so this video became viral
in the social media and this really
broke the narrative
of the israelis suttler colonialism and
now
the people are no longer buying the
israeli
narrative i was asked two days ago
honestly
for the first time in germany somebody
asked me
if my parents have homes in what is now
israel and it was a stolen from
them i was surprised by this question
because we never reached to this level
of discussing the
colonialism of israel and my answer was
yes
we have a land which is now israel and
we have this contract
from the ottoman and then by the british
mandate
this break through in the israeli
narrative
is very important for the public opinion
around the world
in my opinion
many thanks uh professor chomsky uh
really um
thanks a million thanks to you as well
obviously imad
i'm very glad this conversation happened
um so i wish you a very good day
you know i'm very good evening imad and
i'm so happy
to have known chomsky and it will be a
live memory for me
thank you so much for accepting for this
very please have a chance to talk to you
okay that's that's amazing bye bye
bye thanks again
