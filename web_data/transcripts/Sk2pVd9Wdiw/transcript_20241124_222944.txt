hello everyone and welcome back to
conversations with Tyler today I'm
chatting with Noam Chomsky who needs no
introduction gnome welcome
good to be with you
if I think of your thought and I compare
it to the thought of Wilhelm van
Humboldt what's the common ontological
element in both of your thoughts that
leads you to more or less agree on both
language and Liberty
but Humboldt was
first of all the great linguist who
recognize some
fundamental principles of language which
were rare at the time and are only
beginning to be understood but in the
social and political domain he was
he was not only
the founder of the modern research
University but also one of the founders
of Classical liberalism is
fundamental Principle as he said it's
actually a
epigram for
John Stuart Mills on Liberty
is that the fundamental right of every
person is to be free from external
illegitimate constraints free to inquire
create pursue people to pursue their own
interests and concerns without arbitrary
Authority if any sort restricting and
limiting them
now you've argued that Humboldt was a
platonist of some kind that he viewed
learning as some notion of reminiscence
are you in the same regard also a
platonist
well leibniz pointed out that Plato's
theory of
reminiscence was
basically correct
but it had to be purged of the error of
reminiscence
in other words not an earlier life but
rather something intrinsic to our nature
enlightenments couldn't have proceeded
as we can today but now we would say
something that has evolved and has
become intrinsic to our nature for
people like Humboldt
what was
crucial to our nature was what is
sometimes called the Instinct for
Freedom basic fundamental human property
should lie at the basis of her
social and economic reasoning and it's
also the critical property of human
language and thought this was
recognized in the early Scientific
Revolution
gonna do
blood nuts a little later people like
Humboldt in the Romantic area
the fundamental property of human
languages this
a unique capacity
to create
unboundedly many new thoughts in our
minds
and even to convey be able to convey to
others
who have no access to our minds their
innermost workings Galileo himself
thought the alphabet was the most
spectacular of human inventions because
it provided a means to
carry out this miracle
Humboldt's formulation was the language
enables language and thought which we're
always pretty much identified the
language it enables what he called
infinite use of finite means we have a
finite system we make unbounded use of
it those conceptions weren't very well
understood until
the mid-20th century with the
development of the
ory of computation by Kurt curdle Ellen
Turing other great mathematicians 1930s
and 40s but now the concept of
finite means that provide infinite scope
is quite well understood in fact
everyone has it in their laptop by now
was it the distinction between natural
and artificial language that led
Rousseau istray on politics so you're
left libertarian Rousseau is in some
ways almost a totalitarian right
Rousseau is a very mixed character he's
not a systematic thinker you can find
all sorts of things in Brazil
so if you look at the
second discourse on inequality it's
highly libertarian
deriving from
basically
Cartesian principles about the
uniqueness of and creativity of human
thought and language onto a
fairly libertarian conception of social
organization that's one or so you can
always also find a very different one
why are you skeptical of evolutionary
approaches to language
I'm not I'm skeptical of
mistaken
a misunderstandings of evolution which
lead to all sorts of errors in thinking
about how language evolved
so in the modern period
20th century mainly under the impact of
behaviorism some other modern tendencies
a misunderstood version of Darwinism it
was has generally came to be believed
and still is believed in many quarters
that human language and the language
thought first of all the language was
not was the tradition from Classical
Greece up through the 19th century was
that language is fundamentally an
instrument of thought
so it is what is generated by language
language generates thought they're
intimately related if not
indistinguishable language was described
as an audible thought need not be
horrible we know now 20th century change
day it under behaviors influences
came to be thinking of languages
basically an instrument of communication
which evolved from animal systems every
animal about the bacteria has some kind
of communication system even trees
communicate so the assumption is well
language is just a more developed human
language it's a more developed form of
communication
I think we have
it's controversial but my own view is
that
recent work shows that the tradition was
quite right
that that's not the way human language
and thought evolved at all they evolved
in quite a different way which is
completely consistent with the actual
theory of evolution
not the
uh
naive version that often believed so it
may be for example that natural
selection played very little or almost
no role in the evolution of
language and thought but that's quite
consistent with the theory of evolution
many of the things happen in evolution
beyond the
natural selection and in fact
it's pretty good evidence for the we
have
the thread only fragmentary evidence
from the archaeological record
but it's pretty clear by now that humans
appeared on Earth very recently modern
humans
two to three hundred thousand years ago
it's nothing an evolutionary time
we now have genomic analysis
pretty sound that shows that these small
modern Homo sapiens groups that emerged
very quickly began to separate
and quickly again in evolutionary time
maybe 50 000 years
we know that they all share the faculty
of language and thought there seems to
be no distinction among living humans in
this regard
including the descendants of those who
separated maybe 150 000 years ago
with that indicates that these
capacities were already in place
before the separation
well if you look in the archaeological
record
prior to the appearance of modern humans
there's almost no evidence of any more
than very superficial symbolic activity
not not just on a bone or something like
that not long after the appearance of
humans you start getting extremely rich
records of uh
in of advanced creative activity of the
cave paintings for example which are
pretty remarkable I was lucky enough to
be able to
get into this code before it was sealed
and it's astonishing you can understand
why Picasso when he saw it and we
haven't learned anything in tens of
thousands of years well let's go is
fairly recent 30 maybe 30 000 years ago
but no
it goes back to maybe 80 000 years these
seem like long numbers but in
evolutionary time these are
well what does all this suggest
suggests that something happened
along with the appearance of modern
humans
namely the emergence of these capacities
that we're talking about
that amazed together on both and others
and nothing's changed since
there's been no uh no change that we can
detect in the uh
nature of these cognitive capacities
which seem to be
species properties of humans in the
technical sense meaning
common to all humans apart from
extreme pathology
and completely unique nothing like them
anywhere in the animal world
will
misunderstandings of darwinian evolution
lead you to think that this is
inconsistent with it so if you're quite
consistent with the modern theory of
evolution
I mean Darwin did have a famous
statement saying that
all
evolutionary changes have to be very
small even said if this turns out not to
be true my
total Theory collapses well it's now
known that that's just not true there
are
of major changes that take place
suddenly
a lot is known about this one of them
may well have been seems to have been
whatever happened pretty much along with
the appearance of modern humans which
provided these capacities which again
have no analog in the animal world that
are common to the species
now you've been very critical of large
language models there's a recent essay
by Stefan Wolfram where he argues the
success of those models is actually
evidence for your theory of language
that they must in some way be picking up
or detecting an underlying structure to
language because their means are
otherwise too limited to be successful
what's your response to that view
he's a
brilliant scientist I've spoke to him
sometimes I think this is
partly true but partly misleading
the large language models
have a
fundamental property which demonstrates
that they cannot tell you anything about
language and thought
very simple property it's built-in
principle can't be modified
namely they work just as well for
impossible languages as for possible
languages
it's kind of it's as if somebody
came along with a new periodic table of
the elements
which included all the elements and all
impossible elements and couldn't make
any Distinction on them but tell us
nothing about about chemistry that's
what large language models are
you give them a data set that violates
all the principles of language will do
fine doesn't make any distinction
what the systems do basically is
scan and astronomical amount of data
find statistical regularities
string things together using these
irregularities they can
make a pretty good prediction about what
word is likely to come next after a
sequence of words a lot of very clever
programming a lot of massive computer
power and of course
extra unbelievable amounts of data but
as I say does exactly as well with
impossible systems as with languages
so therefore in principle it's telling
you nothing about language
there is some like all organisms we have
innate capacities
there's something about her
genetic endowment that determines that
the embryo grows arms not wings and
there's something about the genetic
endowment that says that
an infant a newborn infant can instantly
pick out parts of the noise that
surrounds it and say to itself those
parts are language
and I'm going to
not consciously of course it's all
totally reflexive these parts are
language I'm going to pursue
the course of maturation will determine
course of maturation which means that by
about two or three years old I've
basically absorbed the fundamentals of
language
that you can take
the smartest chimpanzee or the dogs
under my desk they can listen to this
noise forever they have no idea there's
anything there but noise
well that's a fundamental property if
humans built in
it's the reason why
you and I can be having this discussion
now but uh Trope of chimpanzees can't be
do you think your critiques of media and
the idea of manufacturing consent in any
way spring from your underlying views on
language more from my Fusion
social and political structure
uh
in fact the phrase
manufacturing consent was not mine
I borrowed it from Walter lippman's as
you know the leading public intellectual
of the 20th century
good liberal the Wilson Roosevelt
Kennedy liberal he was
a member of the of Woodrow Wilson's
propaganda
machine Wilson
[Music]
uh
I don't want to tell you this you know
it better as well as I do but for the
record Wilson was elected
in 1916 on a pacifist program I'm going
to keep you out of war the U.S
population didn't want to get into the
European War
uh very quickly he decided that the
United States should enter the war on
the Allied side
and had a problem
how do you turn a pacifist problem
population
into railing
anti-german maniacs
succeeded brilliantly part of the device
was a commission that Wilson set up
called the Committee on Public
Information which of course means
disinformation Creole commissions it was
called Walter Libman was a member of it
another member of it was Edward Bernice
who went on to be
one of the main founders of the public
relations industry
both Wilson and vernais were very
impressed with how what
lippman called
manufacturer's consent
were nice called engineering of consent
how these techniques could control the
public shape opinion completely turn
them into in this case
a fanatic and a German
people who want to kill everything
German
y have to say hot dog you have to kill
those
I mean change your name if you're German
to something else
also a huge attack on labor came out of
it was very effective for the corporate
sector they meant to smash the labor
unions with all kind of claims of
antipatriotism and so on will Lippmann
in particular was very uh persuaded by
this as Bernice was Litman called it a
new art in the main in the practice of
democracy
it's important to understand that the
both Littman and Bernice and adopted the
standard liberal position
that the population is stupid as the
terms were stupid and ignorant they
don't know what's good for them we the
responsible men have to
do the planning and the in the for their
benefit of course and meanwhile we have
to as Litman put it protect ourselves
from the Roar and the trampling of the
bewildered herd the very leninist
Doctrine if you think of it very similar
rhetoric that goes right up to the
present distinction that was made in the
Kennedy years between
what were called the technocratic and
policy oriented intellectuals the good
guys and worked on policy and so on and
the values oriented intellectuals the
bad guys what matures Bundy called The
Wild men and the wings who talk about
ridiculous things like justice and
rights and so on uh
this is a very consistent property of
the intellectual classes from way back
pretty much independent of political
commitment in any event manufacturer's
consent was uh just to quote some more
Litman uh they said
the public have to be can be Spectators
but not participants in action
they are not supposed to
take part in
any of public affairs we do that
they
as Reinhold neighbor put it they have to
be fed in necessary Illusions and
emotionally potent oversimplifications
uh well we take care of things for the
common good one aspect of this was
separating the economy from public
affairs economists played a major role
in this including liberal economists
mainly liberal economists separate the
economy which is just pure science we
take care of the science public should
have nothing to do with it all of these
are major strains in modern modern
thought they have much earlier Origins
and
in the book that Edward Herman and I
wrote about Manufacturing consently
developed selected these conceptions
looked at the structure of the media and
tried to show that in fact the
institutional structure the media these
conceptions of the nature of the
intellectual world combined to yield a
very effective propaganda system
you seem to be relatively optimistic
about the future but if human beings are
so susceptible to propaganda why be so
optimistic shouldn't you just think
we're stuck in a continual illusory
equilibrium where people Feed Us BS and
we Just Keep On Believing it well
there's first of all it's
I mean I wish I could say that it was
relatively optimistic
if you look at the way the world is
going today it's extremely hard to be
optimistic
I mean we are facing two enormous crises
there's a reason why the Doomsday Clock
of the bulletin of atomic scientists was
recently moved to 90 seconds to midnight
one is the
growing threat of
nuclear war which will be terminal War
another is the failure to take the
necessary and feasible steps to deal
with the
existential crisis of environmental
destruction they're moving in the
opposite direction on both and there's
not a lot of time
the leadership elements cross the across
the board around the world very few
exceptions are dedicated to racing to
the precipice as quickly as possible
that's not much grounds for optimism
nevertheless
there are grounds if you look over
history
people have organized resisted stood up
overthrown repressive autocratic
structures
created a
broader reign of freedom and justice
plenty of awful things remain but if you
look back at what used to be
perfectly acceptable you can see we've
come a long way even just in the last
couple of decades so go back to the
1960s for example
in the 1960s
the United States had
anti-miscegenation laws which are so
extreme that the Nazis refused to accept
them
we had
federally mandated housing segregation
that meant that
Afro-American black Americans maybe in
the growth period of the 1950s and 60s
black man could get a job at a decent
job at an auto plant
but he couldn't buy one of the homes in
Levittown
he couldn't and of course
wealth in the United States for most
people is property owning so the black
population was cut out
from this opportunity in the 50s and 60s
to
enter into
at some level at least into mainstream
American society by segregated federal
federal laws which mandated segregation
Less in the late 60s uh
women's rights women were still in the
1960s under federal law not regarded as
peers
basically regarded as kind of property
was until 1975 that the Supreme Court
finally uh
ruled that women have the rights of P of
the right to serve on a federal jury for
example to be peers all sorts of changes
have taken place countries much more
civilized than it was
just 50 or 60 years ago well didn't
happen by Magic it happened by lots of
popular struggle you go back in history
there's more and more examples of that
and you can see it right now
I mean I mentioned that the leadership
class is racing to disaster
but there's a lot of activism among the
public mainly young people
saying we insist on a better future
you see it at the
cop meetings you know the regular
meetings cup 26 27. now there's actually
two meetings going on
uh they can Glasgow last time was Sharma
Sheikh so it's so far away nobody could
come but in Glasgow there was a meeting
going on inside the Halls where the
elegant ladies and gentlemen were doing
nothing
and outside in the streets there were
tens of thousands of young people
demonstrating saying
we have to take steps to prevent a
disaster that you all know is coming
from heating the environment and we
demand it and insist on it well there's
one of those meetings is a reason for
pessimism the other is a reason for
optimism
on nuclear war what has been your
opinion of the doctrines of Thomas
shelling
it's okay I mean at an abstract level
yes you can talk about these things fact
of the matter is that even contemplating
the possibility of nuclear war is insane
literally insane there cannot be a
nuclear war between
major Powers the
the the the country that launches a
first strike
will be destroyed
even if there's no retaliatory strike
just from the effects of nuclear winter
there's a lot of casual talk about these
things and you know showing can
carry out his
game theoretic
analyzes and so on but the basic point
is every step has to be taken to ensure
that there is no possibility of this
happening
um there are people who understand that
people like Former Defense secretary
William Perry for example
has been
his whole life in the nuclear
establishment in the state system
he says he's terrified
doubly terrifying terrified once because
we're
racing towards Disaster Day by Day
doubly terrified because there's no
attention being given to it
sometimes it's just astonishing
so the Pew polling agency
a couple of weeks ago came out with
they give regular studies of public
attitudes on all sorts of things very
valuable the latest one they gave people
a couple of dozen choices of issues and
asked them to rank them in terms of
urgency
nuclear war was not even on the list
climate change was on the list it was
ranked at the bottom of the 21 choices
that's manufacturer of consent in a form
which is going to destroy us all
why does the hall left libertarian
Tradition at least to me seem to be so
weak today so if I mention Rudolph
rocker to someone the chance they have
heard of him is extremely small I'm sure
you experienced the same maybe they've
heard of him because they've read your
writings but to have heard of him
separately that hardly ever happens
the new left of the 1960s mostly has
vanished how and why did that happen
I don't think it's true
I think the new list of the 1960s
which incidentally was a very brief
period
it's it's scattered splintered but it
left a major imprint
what I've just described was largely an
effect of the new lift of the 60s
chain its civilized the society in many
ways things were just taken for granted
in the 60s You couldn't possibly even
say no
well that's the effect of the activism
of mostly young people what was called
the new lift so it's not a movement but
it's all over the place it's a change
the way we see and think of things
almost everybody it's uh
the libertarian socialism anarchism of
course they're not going to be popular
we have a
class-based Society rigid class-based
Society
the business classes the ultra rich or
dedicated to class war
they're basically
vulgar marxists foot values inverted
constantly fighting a harsh class war
they control the resources control the
institutions control the economy
so yes ideas that they don't like you
don't hear
nothing novel about that and go back to
George Orwell
one of his essays he wrote about how
in England it was said in free England
unpopular ideas can be suppressed
without the use of force
just because of the class nature of the
society and the subordination of
intellectuals to power
incidentally his essay was suppressed
just to make it a little more dramatic
found later in this unpublished essays
if I think of some of the new Left
critics of say the Cold War the
revisionists you've seen more mailman
Pentagon capitalism Sydney lands DF
Fleming I'm sure you knew many or all of
these people to me they sound if
anything more like the trumpian right
than say the Democratic party this been
this odd inversion where foreign policy
ideas fears of you know a deep State
manipulating the system those have
shifted to the trumpists what do you
make of that how do you feel
well the revisionists didn't talk about
a deep state
they talked about the existing public
institutions
uh the corporate sector which is
overwhelming role in determining State
policy the uh military industrial system
which is a large part of the economy
they you read people like
the main
writers at the time Gabriel kalka and
others that's they were talking about
how this determines the nature of policy
and uh it doesn't sound at all like the
new I mean the new rate has some of that
rhetoric but it's a joke
the right wing of the Republican party
or
uh
just serval servile worshipers of the
very rich and the corporate sector
take a look at their legislative
programs
during the Trump years there was one
major legislation
what chose a state that's called the
donor Relief act of 19 2017.
a tax cut that was a gift to the super
rich in the corporate sector at the
expense of everyone else and take a look
at their programs right now
main programs are first of all guarantee
that as a red line you cannot touch the
huge Trump tax cut now what you have to
do is defund the Internal Revenue
Service why because they go after tax
cheats who are the wealthy and the
privileged can't do that we have to
protect them save them I mean meanwhile
what Trump managed to do was pretty
effectively
is like a good demagogue is stand up
with a banner in one hand that tells
working people I love you well with the
other hand you stab him in the back
that's a very that's basically the
policy when you look at foreign policy
Tucker Carlson the risk to say we don't
want to waste money in Europe
but there's a bottom line to that
we want to save our resources for a war
against China
it's insane
I mean
you're right about the Democrats they're
in the their foreign policy
a group is in the hands of basically old
neocons neoconservatives uh that's true
the grouper of Biden but the GOP is much
more even more dangerous
if I look back on someone like Susan
Sontag
she becomes it seems to be a maoist why
is it that left libertarianism touches
her and many others so little
what's the appeal of maoism isn't that
the opposite of left libertarianism and
what you stand for
there was a
tendency in what's called among lift
intellectuals
late 60s early 70s to flirt with maoism
they had no idea what it was
it was a very mixed story uh
I mean had very brutal harsh elements
destructive elements
there are also aspects of maoism which
aren't discussed much here the
scholarship is aware of them
one of the things that the maoist
policies did was
save a hundred million people
a hundred million people were saved from
death and starvation as compared with
Democratic capitalist India in the same
years
you look from
1979
1949 Liberation to
1979 compared to the demographics of the
two countries
there's a gap of a hundred million
people
killed in India as compared with China
simply because of the lack of tearing
out rural development and Healthcare
programs
there's no big secret about this
it's discussed by some of the leading
Scholars like a March Us in for example
Nobel Laureate and Indian economics this
is one of his main specialties
hardly obscure but you don't hear about
it that's manufacture of consent again
but this is not why people like
on people on the left flirted with
maoism they had all sorts of
confused ideas about
maoism in fact if you want the most
enthusiastic malice in the country
his name happens to be Henry Kissinger
he adored Mel he worshiped him
if you wanna
picture of this urge that you take a
look at the
very important scholarly work that just
appeared Carolyn eisenberg's
extensive detailed study of the Nixon
Kissinger years using extensive archival
material
one of the things that comes out is
Kissinger's
starry-eyed adoration for Mao uh with he
himself was a terrible sycophant but for
Mao in particular
which do you feel has seen a better
trajectory if you compare the two
countries Nicaragua which is experiment
experimented partially with socialism
and Panama which has been more
capitalistic hasn't Panama just done
much much better than Nicaragua and I've
been to both countries in the last 10
years to me it doesn't seem close what
am I missing
you're missing what actually happened
Nicaragua in the 1980s was the second
poorest country in Latin America after
Haiti
the sundinista revolution in the early
80s began to change that
began to Institute programs which were
very much praised by the World Bank
International financial institutions
uh organizations like Oxfam which were
finally doing something Nicaragua had
been in the hands of the United States
for since late 19th century it was a
catastrophe likes to it every country in
U.S ends
it began to escape from this in the
early 80s very successful well
Ronald Reagan launched a war against
Nicaragua
the United States was actually brought
to the world court and condemned for
International terrorism technically on
lawful use of force in its war against
Nicaragua in order to pay substantial
reparations uh the Oregon Administration
and Congress responded by stepping up
the war
well the war had an effect destroyed the
programs of development destroyed the
hope
restored Nicaragua back to
pretty much U.S control it hasn't
completely succumbed it's now
dictatorial maintained some social
programs but it's never been able to
carry out the programs that were begun
in the early uh
in the early uh
1980s the Panama is totally different
story it's a place for U.S investment
capital investment
parallel Canal is a huge income resource
there's just no comparison between the
two
wouldn't Cuba be better off today much
better off if it had gone the path of
say Dominican Republic inviting a lot of
multinational corporations have free
trade zones special Enterprise zones
Dominican Republics now one of the
wealthiest countries in Latin America
so let's take Cuba
Cuba was
a Cuba is the oldest issue in U.S
foreign policy it goes back to the 19th
to 1820s
when
the U.S intended to try to
conquer take Cuba from Spain and turn it
into another slave state
well John Quincy Adams Secretary of
State realized that can't do that now
the British are too powerful they won't
let us do it so we'll wait until as he
put it Cuba falls into our hands by the
laws of political gravitation we'll get
stronger Britain will get weaker then we
can take it over
uh 1898 it happened Cuba was liberating
itself from Spain
U.S invaded on the pretext of liberating
Cuba in fact it was for preventing
Cuba's Liberation from Spain U.S turned
Cuba into a virtual U.S Colony stayed
that way it was a
massive corruption Mafia
brutal conditions horrible conditions
for the working for most of the
population
1959 cubic freed itself
within a few months
U.S planes from Florida were bombing
Cuba
March 1960 year later Eisenhower
Administration formally determined to
overthrow the government of Cuba
Kennedy came in launched an invasion
failed
initiated a major terrorist war against
Cuba that was a long time ago right
Cuba's had plenty of time to grow and
recover and it's done terribly Cuba has
been under Savage attack
for 60 years it's astonishing that it's
even survived well it survived barely
it has better health statistics than the
United States it's though it it's
developed the biomedical system which is
one of the wonders of the world despite
U.S sanctions which are so strict that
if Cuba wants a uh something you know
something to use for vaccines from
Sweden they can't get it the United
States is a very violent and brutal
country when the United States imposes
sanctions they are third party sanctions
every country in the world has to accept
them
the world is overwhelmingly opposed look
at the United Nations the votes are
184
to two United States and Israel total
opposition everybody obeys the U.S
sanctions out of fear of the most
violent country in the world the fact
that YouTubers even survived is an
astonishing thing and if you look at
things like health statistics uh quality
of life and so on
it's one of the best in the hemisphere
even better than ours that the European
Union can trade with Cuba right and a
lot of the health statistics have been
revealed to be fraudulent Latin America
can trade with Cuba you can fly from
Mexico the European Union tries to trade
with Cuba
the U.S threatens it with throwing it
out of the International Financial
system the European Union obeys the U.S
sanctions
who's the Thinker on the left say in the
last 20 years whom you admire the most
fine
the people I admire most are the young
people in the streets who are
on the front line of trying to save the
world from disaster there are a lot of
very good people but not up to me to
rank them
but as a writer who is it you learn from
you look forward to their next book you
try to meet with
well
I found recently that the
in this day and age the easiest way to
write and Reach people is through the
internet
so because a lot people don't read books
much anymore
so I've been doing regular books of
interviews and discussions uh several
have come out in the last year and
others others are in the works we'll be
out soon
who's the Thinker on the right whom
you've admired the most over say the
last 20 years
that's
the same point there are people I mean I
read
plenty of good work from
what's called right to left but it's the
quality of the work that counts not the
person I don't rank people a few
questions about the Noam Chomsky
production function
how have you stayed so mentally vital so
late in life
just the
incentive of
so much to do
of such enormous significance
uh I don't see any way to
stop both Sunday
in both of the areas that we've been
talking about I try to maintain and to
maintain a lively commitment to
intellectual work a lot of new work
there but the issues of human concern or
just overwhelming I mean we have to face
the fact that we are in a unique moment
of human history
nothing like this has ever happened in a
couple hundred thousand years that
humans have been on Earth
we now have to decide
within a couple of decades
whether the human experiment
is going to continue
or with it will go down in in glorious
disaster that's what we're facing
we know answers at least possible
answers to all of the problems that
faces
we're not
we're not pursuing them we're going in
the up the leadership is going in the
opposite direction
how can anybody relax under these
circumstances
do you think it's genetic that you're
still going or just essentially
voluntarist
nobody knows a thing about it but it's
you and Henry Kissinger right who would
have thought they would be the two of
them mystery
why do you answer every email because I
take people seriously I think people
deserve respect two final questions
first what's the biggest misperception
people have about you
depends what they read
people reading
uh
Newsweek for example they'll
have the assumption that I think we
shouldn't we should hand Ukraine over to
the Russians
sure that's the way
manufacturer's consent works in the
ideological journals if people read
what I say or
they'll have a different opinion
final question what is it that you will
do next
well the thing I'll do next in 10
minutes
is have
a long discussion at a
major conference and uh happens to be in
Texas on social and political issues uh
annual conference that takes place there
after that go back to the regular work
of
the two sides of my brain
social and political issues
intellectual contributions
and in your in your career where do you
feel it is that you've been most wrong
there are a lot of things that have been
wrong
so for example take
the Vietnam War
I was very much involved in it in fact
was my whole life for a couple of years
but I got involved much too late
I got seriously involved in the early
60s when Kennedy
sharply escalated the war
it was almost nobody concerned with it
at that time but the time to have gotten
involved was 10 years earlier
I didn't know it at the time you know
now
when uh
the government made the basic decisions
early 50s that set the stage for what
became the most hideous crime of the
20th century that was the time to get
involved
not when I did
many other things like that there's so
much that should be done that I haven't
managed to do right now you can say the
same thing
the Holocaust isn't the most hideous
crime of the 20th century
the late 20th century our late 20th
century Noam Chomsky thank you very much
thank you
