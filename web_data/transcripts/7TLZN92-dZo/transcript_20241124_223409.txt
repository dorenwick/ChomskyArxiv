[Applause]
forth there is a concept of the common
good that's relentlessly driven into our
heads uh and it demands that we focus
only on private gain and suppress normal
human emotions of
solidarity Mutual support care about
others so therefore we should be opposed
to acting collectively which is what
taxes are to make sure that everybody's
okay and we should just ask how am I
making out uh what happens to other
people is none of my business actually I
think that's what lies behind the
assault on public education as well and
also on Social Security there a lot of
lying that goes on uh read it in
editorials and the newspapers daily
about the costs of Social Security uh
and the way it's contributing to the
deficit absolutely contributes zero to
the deficit it pays for itself uh but
there's a massive campaign has been for
years to get rid of Social Security a
business run campaign put billions of
dollars into it and also to undermine
the public education system by
privatizing it in various ways and other
devices uh it's interesting to ask what
lies behind all of this I mean there are
pretexts given I pretexts about costs
and so on they can't be sustained and
it's also against strong public
opposition but it
continues very incessantly and massively
my suspicion is that uh the public
education system like National
Healthcare here like Social Security are
based on a different conception of the
common good they're based on a
conception that we care for other people
so Social Security is based on the idea
that say I should care even though you
know I don't need it I've got a nice
pension I should care about a disabled
Widow across town who doesn't have food
the uh or even though I don't have kids
in school uh I should care whether the
kids across the street go to school uh
those are dangerous thoughts I should
care about tens of millions of people
dying every year because they can't get
medical care that's not supposed to be
my business I can get medical care uh I
should care about dying infants because
of the very high infant mortality rate
and other people who are vulnerable
that's a bad a dangerous conception
means you should be kind of a human
being you know not a path ological
creature who's concerned to a mass
private gain period uh well these
conflicts uh go far back in American
history and it's interesting to take a
look at them right through history it's
particularly useful to look back to the
origins of the Industrial
Revolution mid 19th century that's when
the country was undergoing enormous
changes uh as uh uh social changes of
all kinds as the population was being it
had been a pretty much a population of
independent Farmers uh and people were
being driven into the industrial system
uh and working people knew about wrote
about it they weren't silent think
workingclass literature is quite
interesting working people bitterly
condemned the industrial system because
it deprived them of their basic rights
as free men men and women and
incidentally not least women uh there
was a group called Factory girls young
women from the Farms driven into the
textile mills uh who contributed uh a
very extensively to the literature of
protest and Analysis you can find it if
you search for it and it's worth reading
the contributions of the vigorous press
press of that day I think it's the
freest press in American history uh by
Factory girls uh Artisans from say
Boston uh others and uh actually it's
important also as a background matter to
bear in mind that a workingclass culture
at the time was very much alive and
flourishing there's a great book about
this by about England by Jonathan Rose
it's called the intellectual life of the
British working class it's actually a
Monumental study that of the reading
habits of uh the British working class
of that day that's the working class of
Deen in England not very attractive uh
he I'll quote him he contrasts the
passionate pursuit of knowledge by
proletarian
autodidacts with the pervasive
philistinism of the British
aristocracy and it was pretty much the
same
uh here here too in eastern Northeastern
workingclass towns for example Eastern
Massachusetts uh uh in around there and
say in Boston an Irish
blacksmith uh if he could make enough
money would typically hire a young boy
to read to him uh from CL Classics while
he's working the the blacksmith might
have been illiterate but he wanted it
read to him uh this uh uh you take a
look at the factory girls what they were
reading uh they were reading the best
contemporary literature the time what we
now study is Classics they condemned the
industrial system for depriving them of
their freedom and their culture and this
went on for a long time um old enough to
remember the last stages of it
1930s uh large part of my family was a
working class most of them unemployed at
the time uh a lot of them had had very
little formal schooling couple of years
of school uh but they were part of the
high culture of the age I mean they'd go
to Shakespearean plays talk about the
latest concert of the Budapest Str court
at the studied the they discussed the
fashionable ideas and conflicts in
psychoanalysis and every uh political uh
movement that you can think of there was
also a very Lively workers education
system leading largely union-based uh
leading a lot of leading scientists and
mathematicians were directly involved
writing books on popular on Science and
Mathematics intended and teaching
classes intended for working class
audiences who
were eating it up now a lot of this has
been
lost under the Relentless assault of the
Masters of mankind but it can be
recovered and I don't think it's lost
forever well the labor press of the 19th
century took strong positions on many
issues that should have a resonance
today
they took for granted for example quote
them that those who work in the Mills
ought to own them they we don't want
bosses we can do it ourselves uh they
condemned wage labor which they regarded
as not very different from chatt slavery
different only in that it was supposedly
temporary actually that was such a
popular view in the United States that
it was part of the program of the
Republican Party in the mid 19th century
it was also a main theme of the
organized labor movement that was taking
shape the kns of Labor very important
movement which began to establish
relations link up with another major
popular movement Farmers
Alliance and it was initiated by radical
farmers in Texas and then spread
throughout the Agricultural Society
later called the populist movement it
Formed uh Collective Enterprises Banks
marketing cooperatives a lot more it
would have driven the country's most
important Democratic moovie movement in
the country's history and would have
driven the country towards a much more
Democratic
Society uh more authentic democracy if
it hadn't been destroyed largely by
violence as the nights of Labor were we
have a very violent labor history much
more so than comparable countries one of
the reflections of the unusual power of
the business classes in the United
States as compared with other uh other
countries although it's interesting to
bear in mind that similar developments
are underway now in the old Rust
Belt Northern Ohio and
elsewhere uh which could be very
important for the future I think
the prime target of condemnation in the
labor press was what they called the new
spirit of the age gain wealth forgetting
all but self this is 160 years ago uh no
efforts have been spared since then to
drive the new spirit of the age into
people's heads what I've started talking
about as a current example of that
people just have to come to believe that
suffering and deprivation result from
Individual
failure uh not from the reigning
socioeconomic system I'm sure you've
heard plenty of this all your lives uh
there are huge Industries devoted to
this task uh about a sixth of the entire
US economy is devoted to what's called
marketing marketing is mostly propaganda
Ganda uh analysts and in fact the
business literature itself D describe it
as a process of fabricating wants to
drive people to The Superficial things
of life like fashionable consumption and
to impose the right attitudes of
subordination and obedience on the
population so they'll remain passive and
obedient and let us run things by
ourselves
uh the schools are a natural Target for
this as I mentioned uh Mass public
education was a major achievement in the
United States us led the way and very
important
development was a pioner but it had
quite complex characteristics which were
rooted in the class conflicts of the day
that's 19th century so one goal of Mass
public education was to
induce independent Farmers to give up
their independence and submit themselves
to Industrial discipline and to accept
what they regarded as slavery wage
slavery temporary but Cally slavery
that's not easy to do that was a major
goal of the public education
system that did not pass without notice
of course uh so Ralph wal
Emerson he observed that political
leaders of his day were calling for Mass
public
education and he concluded that their
motivation Was
Fear he said the country was filling up
with millions of Voters popular
struggles were gaining a lot of freedom
and the Masters
realized as he put it that we have to
educate them to keep them from our
throats that means me a particular kind
of education educate them the right way
so they'll be obedient passive accept
their fate as right and just and will
continue to rule drive into them the new
spirit of the age uh keep their
perspectives narrow their understanding
limited discourage free and independent
thought which is dangerous uh instill
docility and obedience to keep them from
the master's throats that's common theme
from 150 years ago long time still goes
on right in front of our eyes it's
inhuman it's Savage uh has some effects
and it also meets with resistance and
there have been victories in the
resistance the struggles of the 1930s
for example were considerable victories
uh Carri further in the
1960s uh it had a big civilizing effect
on the society and therefore it's called
the time of troubles it's the standard
term for it it's made people too
civilized uh but uh systems of power
which incidentally includes a good deal
of the intellectual Community they don't
walk away
politely they are constantly engaged in
uh intensive self-conscious class
struggle
uh and soon as there's some victories
for Freedom they immediately prepare a
new assault and that's in fact been
happening since the 19 late 1970s that's
what we're living in now uh was based on
major changes in the design of the
economic system the term design is
appropriate there were alternatives to
how to react to the problems of the day
but the way it was was designed in the
interest of the Masters of course were
involved two fundamental changes in the
late 70s one of them was
financialization of the economy so if
you say go back to the big growth
periods huge growth periods of the 50s
and the60s also egalitarian growth poor
sector had about as much Advan as the
richest sector uh there was a financial
system of course but there was wasn't
inter State banking there weren't huge
financial corporations but Banks were
essentially what banks are supposed to
be in a state capitalist system like
ours if you have some some excess money
put into the bank uh they the bank lends
it out usually to somebody local who
wants to do something constructive uh
buy a house send their kids to college
you know buy a car whatever it may be
that's a bank but not anymore that was
prior to the
1970s uh uh now there's a that the
change LED to a huge explosion in the
scale of financial institutions of a
totally different character and by
2007 uh at a point where the financial
institutions brought about they cause it
the latest of the regular financial
crisis that have been coming since the
early 80s since Reagan uh when they
brought about the latest of them they
actually had about 40% of corporate
profits which is extraordinary uh also
it led to a huge explosion of
speculative Financial flows which did
nothing for the economy they probably
harm it uh but that's one major change
uh parallel to that accompanying it was
de-industrialization now that doesn't
mean that production uh ceased it means
it was sent overseas of course that had
always happened to an extent but there
was a massive increase in it starting in
the late
1970s uh send production overseas to
Northern Mexico to Southeastern China to
Bangladesh wherever you can uh get
terrible working conditions and no
environmental constraints uh so that
leads to uh
uh High profits uh for the Masters not
for the people here who don't have jobs
uh within the United States it's set off
a a vicious cycle leading to a very
sharp concentration of wealth as I'm
sure you know by now wealth
concentration is way far different from
other industrial countries and back to
the most extreme days of American
History uh concentration of wealth leads
almost reflexively to concentration of
political power all sorts of ways uh
that leads to legislation which carries
the Vicious Cycle forward so sharp
cutbacks and Taxation for the rich
corporate taxes way below what it was in
the periods of great economic growth or
elsewhere uh deregulation which
escalates the financial crises ever
since the period of deregulation there
have been regular financial crisis there
were none in earlier years when New Deal
regulations were in place uh other
changes in the rules of corporate
governance which have effectively allow
uh CEOs to essentially to determine
their own salaries and bonuses they can
pick the boards which set the salaries
and bonuses and a whole uh series series
of other uh uh changes uh the
uh as I said it does lead to repeated
financial crisis and these are not a
surprise they are built into the new
system and it's understood that we're
now in the latest of the financial
crisis the worst of all of them so far
and others are pretty likely to come uh
the direct one of the directors of the
bank of England very conservative
economists called calls it a doom loop
it's built into the structure of the
system that we have to have repeated
financial crisis each one worse than the
last could talk about it now for the
Masters this is no problem at all uh uh
actually there are solutions but uh uh
the people who run the place don't want
the solutions and for them it's no
problem because they get bailed out they
want a powerful State Nanny state which
works for them and it does so so they
get paid off uh right now after having
created the last financial crisis the
corporate profits are breaking new
records uh the financial managers who
created the current crisis are enjoying
huge bonuses for them everything is
great population's suffering but that's
not their business uh meanwhile
throughout this period for the large
majority of the population wages and
incomes have practically stagnated it's
last 30 odd years by now it's actually
reached the point that
400 individuals in the United States
have more wealth than the bottom 18 180
million Americans that's extremely sharp
maldistribution well in parallel to all
of this the cost of Elections has
skyrocketed that has an effect it drives
both parties uh even deeper uh into the
pockets of those who have the wealth uh
people of extreme wealth and the
corporate sector uh that that has an
effect too whether you win the election
or you lose it means that political
leaders are more and more beholden to
those who buy their uh buy their victory
for them pay for them and have to be
around next time they run you got to do
what they say say uh there's a a cons a
consequence of this which is actually
pretty well studied in the professional
political science literature uh the
United States a very heavily ped Society
good poll so we quite a lot about what
people think and believe and want and
there are studies good studies that
compare people's attitudes and beliefs
with actual
policy that's where the results come on
Divergence between between the two and
the studies show that about 70% of the
population that's the lowest 70% in uh
and income and wealth have literally no
influence on policy makes no difference
what they think they're
disenfranchised uh as you move up the
wealth and income level you got slowly
get a little bit more influence when you
get to the very
top a very small group people
essentially get what they want what they
paid for what they want that's the
current political system uh well let's
turn to the assault on education it's
one element of the general Elite
reaction to the civilizing effect of the
60s and there's a as always something on
the right and something on what they
call the left on the right side of the
political Spectrum one of the most
useful things to look at is a very
influential memorandum it was written by
Lewis Powell a corporate lawyer who was
working for the tobacco industry he is
later appointed at the Supreme Court by
Richard
Nixon at the other end of the spectrum
pretty narrow Spectrum there was an
important study by the trilateral
commission trilateral commission is
liberal internationalists from the three
major State capitalist Industrial
Systems you us Europe and Japan it's uh
political character is pretty well
demonstrated by the fact that the Carter
Administration was completely drawn from
its
ranks uh both of these from you know the
ends of the mainstream Spectrum provide
good insight into why the assault
targets the educational system and I'd
urge you to look at them well let's
start with a Powell memorandum from the
right had a title the title is the
attack on the American free enterprise
system and it's interesting to read not
only for the content but also for the
style very paranoid
tone uh and that's not unusual for those
who take it for granted that they have
the right to rule if anything gets out
of control it's a tragedy like a spoiled
three-year-old who expects that there's
supposed to have everything and I
something they couldn't get1 thousand
toy so the rhetoric tends to be inflated
and paranoid pretty common in the
business literature well Powell
identifies the leading criminals who
were destroying the American way of life
one of them is Ralph nater with his
consumer safety campaigns the other was
Herbert maruza you know major dominant
figure in American Life uh he was uh
preaching Marxism to the young new
leftists who were on the Rampage uh all
over the
country while their what he calls their
naive victims dominated the universities
and schools controlled television and
other media controlled the educated
community and controlled virtually the
entire government actually if you think
I'm exaggerating I would really urge you
to read it for
yourselves uh well this Total Takeover
of the country by these crazed Marxist
was a dire threat to Freedom he said and
he drew the obvious conclusion quote it
the campuses from which much of this
criticism emanates are supported by tax
funds generated largely from American
Business contributions from Capital
funds controlled or generated ated by
American Business the boards of Trustees
at universities are overwhelmingly
composed of uh men and women who are
leaders in the business system and most
of the media including the national TV
systems are owned and theoretically
controlled by
corporations which depend on profits and
the enterprise system in which they
survive so therefore the oppressed
business people who have practically no
influence on American Life uh should
organize and defend themselves instead
of idly sitting by while our fundamental
freedoms are being destroyed by the
Marxist Onslaught led by Herbert maruza
and Ralph neor uh those are the
expressions of the concerns that
the elicited by 60s activism at the
right end of the political Spectrum
actually much more revealing in my
opinion is the reaction from the
opposite extreme of the liberal
internationalists Carter style liberals
they perceived uh they have a study
called the crisis of democracy came out
in the mid '70s and they perceived the
crisis and they're very open and Frank
about it the crisis was that in the 60s
there was too much democracy the system
used to work fine they said when most of
the population was silent apathetic
passive and obedient uh the American
contributor Samuel professor at Harvard
Samuel Huntington he looked back with
Nostalgia at the good old days quoting
him when Truman had been able to govern
the country with the cooperation of a
relatively small number of Wall Street
lawyers and bankers so that then
democracy flourished with no CME crisis
uh but in the 60s something kind of
dangerous happened special interest
groups began to try to enter the
political Arena and press for their
demands and they identify the special
interests uh women minorities young
people old people
Farmers laborers actually the population
they're the special interest uh and
they're supposed to sit
obediently and watch while the
intelligent
minority uh run things of course in the
interests of everyone that's actually
according to Liberal democratic theory
if you bother reading it uh the actually
there's one group that they omit when
they talk about the various interests
it's the corporate sector and that makes
sense they don't comprise a special
interest they're the national interest
uh so therefore their dominant role in
what we call democracy is right and
proper and you don't have to have any
comment about
it now the trilateral scholars very much
like Lewis Powell were very concerned
about the educational system quote them
they were responsible for the failure of
the institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young that's what
the schools the universities and the
churches are supposed to be doing
supposed to indoctrinate you uh much
like what Ralph Waldo Emerson was
talking about and they were failing you
could see that they were failing because
of these uprisings in the streets and
the efforts of the special interests to
enter the political Arena other
dangerous phenomena so therefore the
trilateral scholars called for more
moderation in democracy people should
become passive and apathetic again and
more effective in doctr ation of the
young if our freedom is to be preserved
well those are the bounds those are the
Left Right bounds and within those
bounds Uh current assault on public
education system takes off in order to
restore order passivity and
indoctrination uh uh I'll give a couple
of
examples some of them anecdote personal
so a couple of years ago it happens that
I I was inv Ed give talks at the
National University in Mexico it's quite
a good University it's free uh some
years ago the Government tried to raise
to to Institute small costs there was a
national student strike practically
closed the country down the government
backed off remains free actually
students are still occupying one of the
administration buildings which is used
as a community center this was about 15
years ago actually something similar
just happened in Quebec in the last
couple of months doesn't get reported
here it's too dangers for people to know
things like that uh in Mexico City at
that time there was a leftist mayor he
established a university that was not
only free but had open admissions so
anybody can go there were remedial
courses for people who didn't have the
right educational background I was there
too it's pretty high pretty impressive
and high level well that's Mexico it's a
poor country uh from Mexico I went to
California that's to the Bay Area that's
one of the richest regions in the world
uh where they're intent right now on
destroying very consciously destroying
the public education system uh which was
the best in the world uh very
systematically the major
universities uh
are virtually being private ized for the
rich becoming like ivy league
universities and uh educational
opportunities for the rest of the public
system are slowly being modified to
provide some kind of Technical
Training something similar to that is
happening all over the country by now in
Most states uh tuition
covers tuition covers more than half of
the costs for colleges uh pretty soon
only the community colleges will be
publicly financed under current
Tendencies and even they are under
attack and analysts seem to agree with
this I'll quote one the era of
affordable 4-year public universities
heavily subsidized by the state uh may
be over meanwhile in private
universities costs are going out of
sight students find themselves in a debt
trap it's now passed over a tril ion
dollar higher than total debt and credit
cards a student debt is designed to be
exceptionally punishing and most debt
you can't get out of in the ways that
are open to others for other kinds of
debt like you can't declare
bankruptcy uh so there's no expiration
debt on the debt that means that
collectors can garnish your wages for
the rest of your life unemployment
benefits of Social Security
uh forever it's a very effective trap
for students cuts down on options
particularly when unemployment when
employment opportunities are reduced so
there aren't many and that's a good
technique of
indoctrination uh the basic idea was
explained by one of the trustees of the
New York State University system he said
there's been a shift from the belief
that we as a nation benefit from higher
education ation to a belief that the
people who are receiving the education
are the ones who benefit so they should
foot the bill that's the new spirit of
the age again he doesn't say whose
belief it is but we can figure that out
uh well as usual the primary victims are
the people who are most
vulnerable uh in this respect it's quite
similar to subprime lending goes after
the vulnerable people is an educational
analog that's the colleges for profit
they seem to offer
opportunities uh but it turns out if you
look there been studies that almost all
students mostly those from the less
privileged classes are plunged into debt
it's a very high default rate uh within
10 or 15 years and that aside the kind
of education they get is pretty thin uh
I'm sure you all know that successful
education from from K to 12 and on
through research universities is very
largely a face-to-face contact among
students among students and faculty as
well and that's all gone in those well
the Mexico California comparison uh
illustrates a very general point the
reasons for the conscious destruction of
the greatest Public public education
system in the world are not
economic Mexico is a poor country
country America is a rich country there
are other rich countries uh Germany
Finland some of the highest educational
standards in the world uh education's
free uh actually the same was pretty
much true of the United States when it
was a much poorer country than today so
in the
1950s during the Great growth period uh
there was a program there was the GI
Bill uh which offered free education to
huge numbers of people could never have
gotten it otherwise uh at public expense
it was very rewarding for them of course
and very beneficial for the country in
fact the GI bill was one important
reason for the uh what economists call
the Golden Age of high growth and
egalitarian growth in the 50s and
the60s uh that was in a poor much poorer
country than than we are now uh there's
a parallel development during the past
30 years of the General enel on the
population at the University level
that's corporatization of the
universities uh so during this
neoliberal period there been a very
rapid increase in highly pray paid
professional administrators and staff I
salaries and so on who bring a business
model to the universities in the ear in
early ear days Administration wasn't
much of a big deal a faculty member
would take off a couple years and be an
administrator and go back to teaching uh
that's much less true today uh there's a
very good study of this if you're
interested by a well-known sociologist
Benjamin Ginsburg it's called The Fall
of the faculty the rise of the all
administrative University and why it
matters and it does matter there are
lots of repercussions one is the
imposition of a business model one
effect of that is a drive towards what's
called
efficiency something you learn about in
business school it's an interesting
concept efficiency is not really an
economic
concept uh as I already mentioned
transferring costs to individuals is
called
efficiency uh only for ideological
reasons we see that all the time so for
example if you call up a bank or an
airline or whatever to uh say check on
some error try to find information you
all know what happens you get a recorded
message that tells you we love you we
love your business and hang on uh and
you hang on well music plays and every
once in a while this recorded voice
comes back and finally at the end of it
all you you get a menu which has a lot
of options most of which are ones you
don't want and it and if you really have
enough patience and hang on long enough
you can actually get a human being well
that's that's that transfers it saves
the business a lot of money it transfers
the cost to the
individuals uh and if you multiply that
by the number of users it's a pretty big
cost well that's uh for business that
increases
inefficiency economists say makes
country more efficient uh for the
consumer it's very costly uh when these
costs are multiplied across the
population they become quite large
there's many other illustrations so for
example yesterday I flew down from
Boston to
Philadelphia in any other country I
would have taken a train would have
taken less time less effort but you
can't do that here uh you can do it from
China to Kazakhstan with the high-speed
rail but not from
Boston to
Washington the uh uh which transfers
cost individuals but on the
airlines as most of you know a couple of
years ago one part of the search for
efficiency has been to stop circulating
air saves the airlines a little money
but of course if you stop circulating
air in the airline it spreads
diseases well but that's a cost to the
individual so therefore it doesn't count
when you measure efficiency what
measures is the cost what counts as the
measure to the business so that's more
of the same phenomenon that's another
version of the new spirit of the age
built into economic Doctrine and the
same kind of thing happens when
corporate culture is imposed on
universities so how do you achieve
efficiency in in a university well one
way is to reduce the ratio of Faculty to
students meaning replace The Faculty by
cheap labor what are called temp temps
in the business world uh graduate
students for example they're easily
exploitable they have no defense they
have no rights they can be replaced it's
very good for the bottom line uh what
the administrators professional
administrators who are running the
colleges look for of course there's harm
to the students but that's not counted
because again if you trans transfer
costs to people that's not a cost uh and
as that trustee I quoted said look
they're the ones who are benefiting so
they ought to pay for it all part of the
ideological character of U uh of what's
called efficiency well another uh uh
strategy is eliminating programs that
are too expensive there's one recent
study that shows that state colleges
around the country country are beginning
to eliminate programs in engineering
computer science and nursing which
happen to be the fields where there are
jobs but the courses are expensive uh so
therefore by good corporate logic you
should close them down I there was a
special twist in Florida the governor at
one point announced that he was going to
eliminate these programs at the major
university but uh meanwhile he was
increasing funding for the football team
which produces revenue and therefore
serves a valid educational
purpose well if you want to privatize
something uh and destroy it there's a
standard method first defund it so that
it doesn't work and people get upset
they say okay let's get out of this
that's happening in the schools public
schools are being defunded so they don't
work very well and people are willing to
accept some form of privatization like
charter schools which works even less
well but you will try it uh uh there's
no improvement on education but it does
help instill the new spirit of the age
that's what counts uh in the background
of all of this are debates about what
education ought to be that's been a
lively issue for centuries goes back to
the enlightenment during the enlight M
there was some evocative imagery to
describe and contrast different concepts
of the nature of Education one image of
Education that was used during the
Enlightenment was that education to be
like a a vessel into which you pour
water uh the uh we've all been through
that and as you know it's a very leaky
vessel we've all been through
experiences where you got got to pass an
exam something you're not interested in
so you study hard and you pass the exam
and a week later you forgot what the
course was about that's one image I'm
sure you've all experienced it there's
another contrasting image which in fact
was the Enlightenment ideal which said
that teaching ought to be like laying
out a string along which the student
proceeds in his his or her own way that
is education should foster discovery not
memorizing uh the Str of course this is
string the structur is designed so that
the process of gaining understanding
gathering information is a creative
activity typically carried out in
association with others that's the
enlightenment ideal and it deres from
much more general conceptions of human
nature and legit social
relations uh well that's very much alive
now about a year ago there was the major
science journal Science magazine ran a
series of studies by a well-known
biochemist about the destruction of
Science Education in the country through
No Child Left Behind similar programs
gives lots of illustrations mostly
talking about the universities and He
suggests some alternatives specific
Alternatives designed to instill the joy
of Discovery and Foster creative
capacity starting from kindergarten up
to universities so in kindergarten I'll
just give one example he describes a
kindergarten program that was you
carried out the kids in the kindergarten
class it started with each kid being
given a dish uh which had in it a
collection of pebbl
shells and seeds and their task was to
figure out which ones were the seeds so
the first thing they did was have what
they called a scientific conference kids
got together and discussed various ways
in which you could tell which ones were
seeds all of this is kind of under the
guidance of a teacher kind of steers
things in particular directions but the
idea was to Foster individual initiative
make it fun to discover okay finally
worked out they finally figured out a
way to test which ones were seeds at the
end of it each kid was given a
magnifying glass the seeds were cut and
the kid could look inside and see the
embryo which causes it to grow those
kids learned something they didn't only
learn biology they learned that it's fun
to discover things it's fun to search
and inquire with others and learn
something that's a lesson for life
uh well there are plenty of other cases
and it can be done at all levels and to
some extent is being done from
kindergarten to research universities
but it has a defect it empowers teachers
instead of humiliating them it enriches
the lives of the students prepares them
for Creative independent lives not
passive obedience so there's a downside
well there are alternatives and
successful models mod in our our own
history and elsewhere actually we should
be able to progress well beyond those
models but it's not going to happen by
itself as always it's going to take
commitment and dedicated struggle not
passive acqu Essence while all of this
goes on before our eyes
