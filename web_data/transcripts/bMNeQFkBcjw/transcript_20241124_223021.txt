between noam chomsky and vijay prashad
called the withdrawal iraq libya
afghanistan and the fragility of u.s
power professor chomsky thank you so
much for taking this time to join me
today
pleased to be with you
i suspect we're going to be talking a
lot about
u.s imperialism
and sometimes i'm guilty of using terms
without really giving explanation to
those terms so can i just begin
by asking
how do you define imperialism
it's uh
the power that
one country exerts
over others can take many forms
and take the form of
military occupation
uh
overthrow of governments uh
uh
strangling countries by
brutal sanctions uh
all sorts of means
is it different from empire
well empire usually
is used to mean
specific form of control
uh
literal domination the way
say the british ruled india
that's an empire
but there are many
looser forms of imperialism
sometimes called
soft power which can be pretty brutal
i mean the united states for example
doesn't occupy cuba
but for 60 years
it's been strangling and destroying the
country
with
no notice that there's anything wrong
so you may have seen a couple of days
ago
a rather good article i think was in the
washington post
about
cuba's
remarkable success
in vaccination
well beyond the united states or other
countries
and it describes it accurately and it
describes the difficulties
for example they can't get
syringes
because
other countries are afraid to supply
them
because of the third party character of
u.s sanctions
and
a researcher has to go to europe to try
to see if he can find some
simple components that they can use to
save people's lives and this is just
described as if
yes that's the weather today actually
it's
60 years of
brutal vicious torture
now even to the extent
of preventing them from
they're carrying out a very successful
program of uh
staving the population for madrid
disease but
okay that's the way the wind's blowing
today
has america always been
an imperial power
well the united states has an unusual
history
the united states is about the only
country i can think of
that's been at war
virtually every year
since its founding
almost always aggressive war
a major reason may be the main reason
for the
revolution was that
king george iii
of england had him imposed a royal
bloccal nation
which prevented the column the colonists
from invading
what was called
the territory of the indian nations
and the colonists didn't want that they
wanted to expand and
take over the lands and exterminate the
population
included
the founder of the country george
washington
great land speculator didn't want to be
restricted by
these constraints
well
the british were thrown out
the constraints were lifted
the colonists immediately
invaded the indian nations
and carried out what they themselves
described as a
program of extermination and expulsion
don't have to run through the details
but it ran through the 19th century
meanwhile the u.s picked up
half of mexico including where i live
in a war that
president grant
described as
one of the most wicked wars in history
he greatly regretted his
participation in it as a junior officer
uh that brings us to the end of the
century after that comes
intervention violence uh
overthrows of governments a burden uh
worldwide and uh astonishing level
no no country comes close
so
call it what name you want i think
imperialism is a good name
has it
american imperialism always been on i
guess a linear project projection or has
it transformed over time
it's transformed
the united states can no longer do
what it did routinely
50 or 60 years ago
just
send the marines you know you can't
can't do that anymore
uh you have to do it in more
roundabout ways because the world has
changed
so for example in the
1980s
reagan
tried to duplicate
what
john f kennedy had done in
vietnam
20 years earlier early 60s
too much public opposition
he went through the same
steps as kennedy
fake white paper
charges of the soviet intervention so on
couldn't do it
there was popular uprising so
significant
that it had to back off
and turn to
massive state terror
was horrible enough but
nothing like what happened in indochina
and today it would be hard to do even
that
that's why the united states is more and
more
reverting to
indirect forms of
destruction and
subversion
not direct
intervention
even the kind that
overthrew the
government of
chile democratic government in
1973 on
what we should call the first 911
much worse than the second 9 11.
that would be hard to do today
but
there are other forms of
subversion and
undermining of governments sanctions
punishments
and remember that
the united states has such
overwhelming power
that alone in the world
when it imposes sanctions
everyone has to accept them
so when
trump pulled out of the
joint agreement on iran
violating security council orders if
anyone cares
he then moved to punish iran
for
the united states having
withdrawn from the agreement
and posed very harsh sanctions
europe opposed them
they didn't like them they uh
said they'd find a way around them but
they ended up obeying them
they don't want to offend the godfather
the world actually runs
very much like the mafia
the
godfather gives the orders and
fathers disobey they're in trouble
in the case of europe
they didn't want to suffer the
possibility of literally being thrown
out of the international financial
system
which is
pretty much run out of new york and
washington
so the the same with cuba
you look at the votes in the united
nations
it's a hundred and eighty four to two
opposed to the sanctions
the
the two are of course the united states
and israel
which has to vote with the united states
uh so you know essentially universal
opposition
makes no difference it barely even gets
reported here
okay
so we're alone in the world in
seeking to torture cuba but who cares
it's our right to do it
because we're the godfather
is u.s imperialism unique in world
history
by no means
the united states is simply
picking up from
its predecessor in world domination
britain
britain had a horrendous record
of centuries
of terror violence and torture
you look over british wealth and power
ask where it came from
well go back to the elizabethan period
came from piracy
sir francis drake the great heroes
were basically pirates
they robbed spanish ships to
steal
uh
gold and metals and so on
great contribution to british wealth
then they turned to
the industrial uh you go back to the
brit when the british took over india
had about 25 percent of
world gdp
when the british got through with it it
was about three percent
they de-industrialized india
stole its advanced
it's much more advanced the technology
ruined india turned it into a
miserable
suffering country
later written turned to the most
grotesque form of slavery in world
history
caribbean
sugar tobacco and so on then moved on to
cooperation with the u.s
in instituting an even more vicious
system of slavery
in the south to get cheap cotton which
was the
fuel of the 19th century
later britain turned to the
largest non-co-trafficking operation in
human history
uh to try that's part of the large part
of the reason for
the extended conquest of india to force
farmers to grow opium instead of food so
that britain could break into the
chinese market by force and violence
and
imposing
drugs into the country well that's
britain
i'm not giving the details the details
are horrifying
you look at france
saying
the french
when the french
were invaded algeria
while the french intellectuals were
talking about their civilizing mission
the
minister in charge was saying we must
exterminate the algerians
that's
uh
just recently for some reason
the new york times has been running a
uh interesting
series on
how france destroyed haiti
with the help of the united
united states
and it's a
horrifying story haiti had to be
punished
brutally for being the first free
country of free men
in the western hemisphere
the united states of course was a slave
society
well can't get away with that so brutal
punishment running right up to the
prison
a couple hundred years and that's france
uh
we can go through the rest of the record
the united states is not breaking new
ground
it's taking the role of
world dominant power
and acting much in the way of its
criticisms
those were european countries is
european imperialism unique in world
history or is this just the path that
the powerful take
it's more than that
there's also russian imperialism
so you look at the history of russia
begins with
the duchy of muscovy
little area around moscow
extends to conquer
much of the uh
much of the world
huge area of the world
that's before
the soviet union
just talking about the czar
uh
then it takes other forms
during the last century
but it's hard to find i mean if
you know you could say the same about
the mongols
who
came out of the plains of eurasia and
conquered large part of the world
i mean it's
it's most of human history
is it impossible to escape imperialism
yes of course
in fact we have
substantially done it
as i said
ronald reagan
wanted to duplicate
kennedy couldn't
too much popular opposition
uh
take iraq
it was the first time in history
that an imperialist invasion
was protested
massively
even before it was officially launched
well that didn't stop it but
i think it certainly limited it
the united states didn't do anything
like what it did in say vietnam
they're just too much internal
opposition
and that internal opposition can
and may
lead to a
more civilized world in which there are
greater constraints on the forces that
want to oppress and dominate
it's not
a law of nature
it's a matter of the way human
institutions are constructed
and popular activism can change things
and has i mean
we're not on a
there are a lot of rotten things today
but it's a much more civilized society
than it was say
50 or 60 years ago
not by a gift from the gods
by
dedicated popular
activism
by people who've been mostly forgotten
most of the people involved
nobody ever heard of
so take the
there was a strong international
anti-war movement in the 60s and 70s
the one the person who was mostly
responsible
for organizing it and keeping it going
was peggy duff
british woman
amazing woman
not only the international
indochina
any war movement but palestinians and
other issues peggy was the one who
basically kept it going
i've you probably never heard of almost
nobody ever heard of okay
that's the way the world works
a friend of mine is
take colombia
which has one of the most
hideous human rights records in the
hemisphere
strongly supported by the us all the way
well there was a popular movement
trying to educate people about it
to act to try to limit the atrocities
passed away a couple of years ago
cecilia zarate alone
nobody ever heard of her except people
who are directly involved
they look around the world that's what
you find
you've heard of these people how how do
you know of them did you know them we're
close friends
peggy who was a very close friend so you
did too
people who were directly involved know
about them
but
there's enough suppression so
it doesn't get very far out
and these are not the kinds of i mean
let's take one of the most
amazing
anti-war nanny terror
popular movements in the united states
the
solidarity movement in the 1980s with
central america
is the first time in history
that people
from the aggressor society
us
not only protested but went to live with
the victims to help them
to provide
whatever
security you could provide with a white
face against the reagan-run
murderous terrorists
uh it was from all over the country
evangelical churches in kansas you know
universities i mean very widespread
nothing like it ever
very significant
it's out of history
that's not the kind of thing that
the media or
the intellectual community wants people
to know
you don't want people to know that it's
possible
not only to protest the crimes of your
own state
but to go to help defend the victims
not a good lesson
so you have to look forward to find a
record of that and of course the people
who are involved know all about it
are we in danger of
losing the names like peggy duff
well partly i suspect
the reason peggy isn't known as squishy
was a woman
but
but it's much more than that
uh people who really are on the front
lines keeping things going
uh they're not
you know the people who are known and
the ones who come and make speeches
maybe doing a very good job
very good job like martin luther king
a remarkable person should be greatly
honored
but i'm sure he would have been the
first person to tell you that
he was riding on a wave that was
created by
snake workers
young
black students who were
riding freedom buses
in alabama facing
real serious terror trying to encourage
black farmers to dare to cast a vote
people like that
we don't remember their names i happen
to know some of them but unless you were
involved you don't know their names
this is letters and politics and we are
in conversation with renowned linguist
and political activist noam chomsky noam
chomsky has a new book out which is a
conversation with vijay prashad a friend
of this radio program it's called the
withdrawal iraq libya afghanistan and
the fragility of u.s power
noam chomsky is
us imperialism
on a decline
it's
it's still the dominant force in the
world
there's no other country that has
800 military bases and all over the
world forces fighting all over the world
as i said no other country can
impose sanctions in the manner that we
can but it's declining
the world is becoming more
as it's called multipolar
so there's a
chinese
poll of influence that's
growing developing
very largely by
soft power
commercial
trade investment loans
plenty of brutality you can find that
too
but it's expanding over
all of eurasia
the belton road initiative the
shanghai co-operation organization
spreading into the middle east
through the
what's called the maritime silk road
which includes the united arab emirates
even extends to israel china runs the
major port in israel haifa port u.s navy
doesn't like that but uh happening
moving into africa
uh even into latin america u.s backyard
where
chinese trade now exceeds
u.s trade
and
latin american countries african
countries
use chinese technology
the united states is trying very hard
to block countries from using advanced
chinese technology
but
not working very well they'd prefer to
have
5g from
china than what the us can offer them
in fact china's
finding interesting ways around this
they've
china set up
hundreds maybe thousands of schools
technical schools
in much of the world africa southeast
asia
where they teach chinese technology
well that's what
people are going to be trained in
that's what they're going to be used
you can say that it's
a form of imperialism if you like but
soft imperialism the u.s can't counter
that
can't counter that with guns
can the u.s become a post-imperial
country and
what kind of changes if so
would have to happen
for that to be would our lives be
different
it's greatly to the benefit
we have to distinguish
what's called the us
which means power centers
distinguish that from the population
from the general for the general
population
it would be much better
to move towards an accommodation with
china
yes there's
plenty of crimes in china
lots of things wrong
can condemn them
but
we should be moving towards
we have to move towards cooperation or
we'll all be destroyed
the major issues that we face
that don't have boundaries
uh global warming is gonna
destroy us all unless we deal with it
properly and there's no boundaries
threat of nuclear war
has no boundaries
you can't contain a nuclear war it's uh
all of these things
and the same is true advanced technology
makes no sense if you take a look at
what just happened in congress
the united states
badly needs
repair of infrastructure
more research and advanced technology
a whole range of things
well
republicans
don't want to allow any infringement on
the power of private
concentrated private powers that they're
always opposed
but this one they agreed to
it was framed as a
competition compete with china act
and if we want to rebuild bridges in the
united states
only way to get through congress say we
have to compete with china
it's a sign of a really sick society
noam chomsky has been our guest again
noam chomsky renowned linguist political
activist new book he has called the
withdrawal iraq libya afghanistan and
the fragility of u.s power noam chomsky
