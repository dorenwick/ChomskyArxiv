[Applause]
would you say
that the indian farmers are doing the
right thing
in protesting absolutely this is a
very important protest and it's amazing
that they've been able to keep it up
in the face of repression violence and
all sorts of media attacks and so on
they're staying there
and they're fighting for the rights not
only
of the farming community but for india
to be
a functioning society caring about
the rights and the welfare of its
citizens indian government
today is telling indian farmers that
open up your agriculture
let the big businesses come in let the
corporates come in
and they will bring an investment they
will bring in
competition they will bring in
prosperity
they will bring in efficiency what would
you tell
indian farmers i would suggest that they
simply look at the fact there was
recently uh
study by the highly reputable
rand corporation quasi-governmental
highly regarded corporation addressing
your question
they asked they tried to estimate
how much wealth had been transferred
in the past 40 years from the
middle class and the working class lower
90 percent in income how much had been
transferred
in the last 40 years from them to the
super rich
when you look at the super rich it's a
fraction of one percent
uh their estimate was 47 trillion
dollars
uh in 40 years which is a severe
underestimate as i'm sure they know the
international monetary fund and others
have
given rough estimates of the scale of
the robbery
it's roughly maybe another 30 40
trillion dollars
you you know in india right now the
government uh
calls those who are protesting the
farmers who are protesting
being influenced by foreign hand
isn't it funny professor that when it
comes to protest
movements foreign hand is such a dirty
word
but when it comes to business and
politics
foreign investment is such a welcoming
word
foreign investment is wonderful foreign
tyrannies tyrannies remember a
corporation is a tyrannical structure
if you want foreign tyrannies to own
your resources
to own your country to determine your
country's future
then welcome foreign investment uh i
would love to hear
your uh message of of message to the
peasants
or the farmers in india who are fighting
they should be extremely proud of what
they're doing
they're doing the right thing with
courage
with integrity for the benefit
of their own families the farmers of
india
the people of india the entire world
who needs this model of
struggle to carry out the same kinds of
actions
and their own circumstances which share
a lot with the circumstances of the
farmers of india

dark times
