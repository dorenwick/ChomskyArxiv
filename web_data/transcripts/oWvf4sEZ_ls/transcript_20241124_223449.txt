[Music]
say I'm delighted to be with you
delighted to see what you're
doing are one of the most exciting
things that happened in my
life it could be really historic
important you
[Music]
[Music]
the world very exciting it's a terrific
movement all over the world it's very
exciting
yeah General attack on the neoliberal
globalization that's been so destructive
all over the world and uh it's been
going on for 30 years and got to be
reversed and you're the guys who are
doing it so that's you got a historic
opportunity there'll be tough times but
got to overcome them you know victories
aren't won
easily Victory is out man a that's a
great start yeah and an exciting one
yeah
wish I could stay spend some time with
you but being dragged off to the
next so keep up what you're doing it's
really
important thank you thank
you yeah should we we could ask one
question yeah all right one question and
we'll do the human microphone if that's
okay it's not doing anything
unfortunately so we'll just do if we can
just
so Australia at the moment is considered
a very stable economy uh by a lot of
people here in Australia and around the
world why do you suggest that people in
Australia get involved in this worldwide
Occupy
Movement um stability is not a great uh
Merit in itself I mean
the Australia is doing pretty well but a
large part of it is based on
achievements which are very harmful to
your grandchildren
uh Australian econom is based very
heavily on mining I tell you and the
mining is uh has consequences it's uh
consequences are felt worldwide they're
extremely harmful
they they do undermine the likelihood
that there's going to be a decent uh
survival for the species in a couple of
generations so stability is nothing
great in itself I mean the Nazi Germany
was very stable too
don't approve yeah and just the second
question I've just gone around Australia
to Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and
I've met people who are working in
corporate I've met people who are
working in Coal Mines I've met people
who are unemployed students workers and
what we've achieved in two weeks seems
to be amazing just coming together
people providing food and water and
shelter for one another what else do you
think this movement could achieve on a
worldwide scale if it continues with the
momentum that it has well on a worldwide
scale there's uh we are living in a
historically unprecedented period
the sort of neoliberal period has been
pretty devastating almost everywhere and
it's had you know it's the basis for the
movements in Egypt for example it was
very destructive to the Egyptian
population enriched a small number of
people same thing in the United States
at different scales
levels it's also entrenching the very
anti-human ideas you know should be
after ourselves we shouldn't care about
anyone else uh these are attitudes that
are just going to destroy the species if
they continue and we shouldn't tolerate
them one of the great things about the
Occupy movements is it's developing and
uh presenting a model of a different way
of life is one we looking forward to he
excuse me
sorry
[Music]

youc upy why does that spell
occup
