greetings I'm Dr Ken hilderbrandt we're
here with Professor gome Chomsky of MIT
the world's most quoted living author
and the reason why I bring that up is
because how many times have you seen him
on corporate television with all these
corporate programs we have on TV all the
time well I haven't seen him on there
very often then again I don't watch TV
too much so what I want to talk about
today know is the myth of the liberal
media
that you have CNN and MSNBC on the one
hand and and and Fox News on the other
hand and people don't really realize
that uh well I want you to go ahead and
you tell us what what you think about
the the liberal
media well my good friend and co-author
Edward Herman has a book called The Myth
of the liberal media in which he exposes
the liberal media dissects them and so
on actually I mean I agree with his
analysis but I don't entirely agree with
his conclusion I think those are the
liberal media if you look at the
Spectrum of permissible discussion in
the United States it's pretty narrow
that's important yeah but it goes from
what's called conservative to Liberal
and that's liberal media the liberal
media are uh deep in the pockets of the
corporate sector are uh very closely
linked to the government they they're
sometimes mildly critical they regard
themselves as very uh independent and
adversarial and so on I've heard the
media leaders talking proudly about how
they stand up courageously against Power
and so on that are triban of the people
and I think they really believe it uh
but if you look at what they're doing it
uh conforms very closely to the U to the
structure of the what the demands of the
system of concentrated power in fact if
you go to journalism schools most of
them teach a concept of objectivity it's
very important for journalists to be
objective and they have a definition of
objectivity uh if something is agreed by
Democrats and Republicans and you report
it you're being objective
if you question it you're being biased
but within the Spectrum Democrat
Republican you're allowed to take a
stand one position or another but try to
get outside that spectrum and that's a
definition of bias as long as you stay
within it it's a definition of objective
right so I agree that these are the
liberal media and that's a description
of American liberalism there seems to be
a few topics that they just don't
discuss apply I mean that the United
States leads the world in prisoners and
in total number and in prisoners per
capita um we have some 800,000 arrests
for possession of a plant every year and
meanwhile some
800,000 kids go missing obviously they
would be catching more of these finding
some of more of these perpetrators that
are abducting these kids uh if they want
to chase these people for possession of
plan and they're just not they're not
making that real they're not making real
that we could use hempy oil to satisfy a
great deal of our energy age right now
while here we are right after the
tsunami in Japan um so uh and and of
course
elections uh neither side is really
being fair about those they're limiting
us to to True choices so we have the the
hemp and the the Cannabis and the
elections well you know all of these are
examples of how the media are being
objective in their technical sense
they're staying within the framework of
U Republican Democratic agreement uh so
we have you know when you say two
candidates even that's misleading we
basically have one candidate uh the
business candidate the only question is
which of the business candidates can you
are we going to get so take say the 2008
election which was supposed a
representative white Spectrum won by
Obama uh he barely won and he won at the
end because he outspent uh McCain where
was he getting the money from he was
getting it from the financial
institutions they preferred him to
McCain they thought he'd be better for
them than McCain was and they're by now
the basically the core of the
economy 2007 they had maybe 40% of
corporate profit uh is pretty harmful
for the economy but you know
very rich for them in fact if you take a
look at inequality in the United States
it's known to be very high but what is
less recognized is that the inequality
is primarily because of the
extraordinary concentration of wealth in
a fraction of 1% of the population right
one1 of 1% in fact well that's uh hedge
managers
CEOs of major corporations mostly
Financial corporations and so on so
that's that's like the core of the
economy and hence the core of political
power because the two go along together
whenn elections or basically bought
anyhow they preferred Obama they ped a
lot of money in uh he was able to swing
the election uh and they expected to be
paid back right and they were right uh
the first thing Obama had to do was pick
an economic team there a big economic
crisis who'd he pick he went to Robert
Rubin you know the sort
of Wall
Street Guru you know and he picked him
and his
men sers tthy gner and others in fact
what he picked was the people who were
pretty much responsible for the crisis
yeah and there were there are other
eminent economists you know no laurates
and so on who uh say Joseph
stiglets and others not left right
pretty much mainstream but critical of
uh the behavior of the uh architects of
the economic crisis the banks and
investment firm they were out total well
that's the beginning of the payback of U
the financial institutions for having
put him into power and then if you take
a look at the policies they came up with
there was a
small stimulus but pretty small in fact
way below what it should have been the
stimulus in fact the total stimulus is
practically flat zero because the
federal stimulus just about compensated
for the decline and spending at the
state and local level so government
stimulus was essentially zero and it was
not enough to lift the economy out of
the Dos uh on the other hand there was a
huge bailout for the criminals the
bankers yeah I mean they're doing fine
they're richer and more powerful than
they ever were in fact right in the
midst of a a couple of weeks ago right
at the same time that you're reading in
the business press that uh 20% of
Americans now qualify for food stamps
right at that point that Goldman Sachs
probably the main culprit in the
economic crisis and royally built out by
the taxpayer they announced quietly a I
think $ 17.5 billion dollar compensation
package for
executives tripling of the base salary
for the CEO Lloyd blank fine and uh I
think a special $12.5 million gift to
him that's right in the middle of this
and these are people who were just paid
up saved from destruction by the
taxpayer and it's not the first time it
happens over and over why do you suppose
that the Republican or the rightwing uh
extreme rightwing media criticizes him
for this
bailout well that's T and cheek they
criticize him for everything they do I
mean if he was walking on the left hand
side of the street they criticizing for
that well they even claim that he's a
socialist that with his health care plan
and really like the the public option
was kept off the table completely over
the objection of about almost 2third of
the population he could have pushed it
through
but that would mean responding to public
concerns and uh there's higher concerns
like the insurance industry uh so in
fact you know the healthcare reform
maybe improved things a little but it
did not touch the core of the problem
the core of the problem is that uh the
US Health Care system is totally
dysfunctional there about twice the per
capita costs of comparable countries
some of the worst outcom comes and if
you look at the famous deficit if we had
the same kind of Health Care system that
comparable countries have it'd be a
surplus but you can't touch that because
they you going back to the financial
institutions now they never get enough
of course so no matter how much they're
given they want more and the Republicans
are basically they're flaks I me they
criticize the bail out but that's
appealing to their base you know they
want to appeal to a base which says the
government shouldn't do anything of
course they think the government ought
to do everything it's just like Ronald
Reagan uh he appealed to the base saying
the government is the problem not the
solution right at the same time he
increased the size of government most
protectionist president in American
history intervene massively in the
economy to support wealth and power you
know uh like for example his Star Wars
program I don't know what he thought
maybe he was watching movies or
something it was sold to the business
Community yeah just as a gift here's
another gift from the government for
High-Tech industry and uh he was even
sold allies that way like Japan and
Germany and so he was big believer in a
powerful interventionist state but the
slogan is government get the government
off her backs uh and the Republicans are
in a somewhat difficult position
remember they are the slaves of
corporate power slavish subserviant at
the same time you know the top one1 of
the 1% of the population is not enough
to vote you into office so they have to
deceive so you have to somehow get
people to follow you and there are
several ways of doing it one way is to
appeal to the Christian right which is a
substantial element in the country right
and if you can appeal to their interests
you know you say okay let's stop
abortion or ever it may be you pick up a
lot of votes wouldn't they have done
that when they had both houses of
Congress and the presidency and the
Judiciary if they really wanted to stop
abortion they have no intention of doing
that I CEOs don't I mean the rich and
Powerful don't care I their wives and
daughters are going to get abortion no
matter what thew but I mean they've used
this as a PL to get people on their way
and yet they've had both houses of
Congress and they had the presidency and
they had the Judiciary and they never
did anything that public doesn't want it
you know they have a there's a segment
of the public that wants it passionately
right and in fact where they're in power
they're introducing it like in I think
South Dakota right yeah they're ramming
it through in one way or another but U
they can't really stop it would be
unconstitutional and they also there's a
big you
know majority large majority with it for
example would be outraged by it so they
can't really push it through but they
can use it as a red meat to throw to the
constituency the same with the claim
that they're in favor of small
government they claim to be in favor of
small government get the government off
our backs but uh the financial
Industries which are the core of the
economy they're the most heavily
subsidized uh uh component of the
economy they're subsidized by U this
government insurance policy that they
get uh too big to fail so you make risky
Investments and transactions you make a
lot of money you get into trouble and
you run to the taxpayer he bails you out
that's and you're Richard never they
claim to be opposed to that but they're
the strongest ones in favor of it and
you can see it when you get to policy so
when you get to Pol after all the bail
out it was started by a bush in pul and
uh when you get when you get to the
regulatory system there are some
attempts you know the dod Frank Bill to
try to impose some discipline into the
regulatory system who's trying to kill
it the
Republicans they don't want to Reg
system the um getting back to the the
top one% of incomers one1 of them right
I you're right and I think that that
probably there should be another
subcategory at this point because
um well I heard on the news uh on the on
the radio when I was coming through New
Jersey now this had to do with New
Jersey's Taxation and they were saying
well the that you know the top 1% is
paying like I forget it was 41 or 43% of
the overall tax and this is what they
throw out to people all the time they
don't throw out to people how do they
make their money either Earth's
resources or human labor now I mean
that's how El do they get we're not
importing either one of those from Mars
well you know I mean there not everybody
is a tax Dodge or so somebody pays taxes
and of course it's going to the people
the fact that this figure that they're
throwing out is a reflection of the
concentration of in of of income since
income is so radically skewed to the
very rich uh there going to be you know
they'll pay most of the taxes naturally
that's a reflection of the I mean even
if we had a flat tax that would be true
if you want to know more about what's
going on read the front page of the New
York Times today they have a good story
for once on the General Electric the
biggest corporation in the country they
got profits bulging out of their pockets
they're paying zero taxes in fact
they're getting a rebate now Senator gel
blamed them and uh and the Democratic
party for uh keeping him out of the
debates it was gen because General
Electric owned MSNBC and it was MSNBC
who censored him from of the debates so
here you don't hear about a guy who
helped and the the Vietnam War by
reading the Pentagon
papers in front of the Senate so they
really I mean people seem so frustrated
nowadays um they are the population's
frustrated I think it's where the tea
party comes in but they just it's
misguided and they appeal to uh you know
they themselves are a small sector of
the population relatively affluent
native as small town businessmen and so
on uh but they uh they've been there for
a long time that sector but by now they
have an appeal to a much broader sector
that's really angry and frustrated and
don't know what to do uh so let's take
it out on they hate everything hate the
Democrats hate the Republicans hate the
banks hate the government hate
scientists whatever it is we hate it and
that can be mobilized by concentrated
power to get their way on what matters
and they're doing it you know I I wrote
something uh recently and I just said
that you know we have
this more prisoners than anybody else
one of our leading cries is possession
of a plant um I mean recently had
helicopters flying over by property and
adjacent people and they got you know
for they found some people for growing
marijuana and obviously they weren't
growing in their own property so who
knows who was doing it but they I mean
that was an awful expenditure and
um you know the average person thinks
well what can what can I do okay we
could be grow using hemp seed oil uh you
know to handle a great deal of our
energy needs and we know I mean gosh if
it could reduce some of these nuclear
power plants wouldn't that be wonderful
and there's there's these Solutions and
they're censored by the media and I
suggested what I think is when people
say we need a revolution I just find
that extremely impractical I don't think
that that's going to happen and but an
informal tion If people could just
inform one another and I mean something
has to happen to them we're not on a
very good course I mean you go to the
recing said that it's just surreal we're
going off a cliff and there is
strikingly there has been the first
major reaction what happened in
Wisconsin Ohio and Indiana that was
pretty surprising I mean in Wisconsin
there were tens of thousands of people
on the streets for a long time occupying
the state capital I they lost in the
legis in the legislature but they had a
they reached I mean about probably
two-thirds of the population Wisconsin
supported them uh it was rammed through
by you know the coach brothers and the
governor trying to right spearhead an
attack on the last remaining U labor
unions had nothing to do with the
deficit but it had to do with the fact
that organized labor remains a barrier
to complete corporate tyranny so they
want to wipe it out and uh unfortunately
Obama's did you hear a word from Obama
about this no the Democrats more or less
supported you know when in the research
for my book I found that a lot of the
candidates uh the Democratic candidates
were hogging up the the pack money the
corporate money so I mean if you want to
be in the political game now you have to
uh be in the pocket of the corporations
that's what happens when elections are
bought right I mean since the 70s the
price of winning a seat has just
skyrocketed and you can pretty well uh
predict who's going to win just by
looking at campaign spending but that's
where I think like if we could inform
people you know this this was the 10th
time we' met up actually and um you know
I've said that I my my personal opinion
is that I think we should go for these
third party or independent people who
are I mean I don't know if there was a
big difference between Obama and McCain
getting in there I mean maybe we would
have invaded Iran I I I don't know how
much worse it would have been with
McCain so really what but but we keep
drawing the line they keep drawing the
line further and further to the right
and we keep going along with them and uh
well because they have the system locked
up they have the system you can't run an
independent candidate it's almost
impossible for one thing you need a t
either you need a huge amount of popular
support support effort right well you
know to get effort overcome get to
overcome the concentration of uh wealth
which is a real job right and you got to
work on that but uh if not if you don't
have that then there's no way to run in
a campaign unless you're corporate
funded you need the nas effort and you
know even with that by now the the Ralph
naters talked about this the geram
mandering of electrical electoral
district has gone so far that most of
them are just locked up well it would
have to be a completely overwhelming
Victory it would really have to be
overwhelming otherwise it just wouldn't
haveen and uh that requires massive
organization I mean it like part of the
reason for going after the last
remaining unions with such a friend
is that they are the core of the
possibility of organizing so you got to
get rid of them yeah get an atomized
population where maybe everybody's
frustrated and angry but they don't know
what to do well they were complaining on
the radio broadcast I was hearing about
you know well these ones want benefits
and this and that and and you know I
mean we we had everybody had benefits 20
years ago it's just let this wealth is
is concentrated up there and they keep
having to they're not complaining about
the benefit
that Goldman Sachs is giving to its
Executives yeah that you keep quiet
about what you what you focus on is the
fact that uh teachers don't have to
starve after they retire yeah well
that's that's good propaganda
wow it could be a better world I just
hope that we uh we start taking some
steps in in that direction really you
take a look at the Republicans the
republicans in Congress are interesting
and the house I mean they're not going
to get their will I don't think it'll be
blocked but it's interesting what they
want so right now for example there you
take a look at science for example I
mean Science and Technology are are the
hope for the economy of the future
forget the benefits you're not going to
have an e a functioning economy if you
don't have a lot of science science and
technology that's where the modern
economy comes from and it will in the
future too they want to destroy it
they're cutting back funding on the
basic parts of on the parts of the
government that are right at the core of
funding scientific innovation and
development and training and so on rid
of it and that's another thing with hemp
that's another solution I mean here they
got us involved in KN in the World Trade
Organization we lost all these jobs then
they look down on these people who don't
have any employment what are they going
to do I mean hemp is something else that
could also be a shot how do they how can
they with solution well but take take
Green Technology I mean if there's going
to be a solution to the energy crisis
it's going to be in solar power and so
on well you know Americans are investing
in solar power but they're investing in
it in China not
here I have to give you some things on
the hemp uh see well that's just it's
really pacy and plus all the other
products with that too uh well the one
of the uh uh sectors of the science
science Community that's being cut back
that the Republicans want to cut back is
the U funding
for biotechnology you know turning
cellulose into you know useless
cellulars into usable fuel they want to
stop that
right what do you think's going to
happen I mean what happened in Japan we
can't afford any uh more access and it's
like that right when this was happening
in Japan uh Obama authorized more
nuclear plants me to Chile and made a
deal for nuclear energy and then the
disaster in the gulf and uh they don't
seem to be that concerned about offshore
drilling and uh it's just it just amazes
me I remember that that Hume stated uh
centuries ago that nothing
appears uh more surprising to those who
consider human affairs with a
philosophical eye than the easiest with
which the many are governed by the few
so are you in agreement that most
Americans are are are being misled here
at the height of the information age
that's what he said he said it's because
of the power of what we call propaganda
he didn't call it that but we have the
internet now I mean that's a tool it's a
tool but it could be but I me the
internet is only a tool if you know how
to use it like for example you could
walk into the Harvard Library and learn
tons of things if you know what you're
looking for if you don't know what
you're looking for it's just chaos right
and the Internet is just that magnifying
it has to be some organization has to be
organized structure you have to there to
be a framework that you develop and that
comes out of uh education and
organization when individuals just go
into the the internet alone they often
end up with completely crazy views you
get know what to evaluate there has to
be has to be organized has to be some
kind of uh Community uh organization
along with the internet and otherwise
they're going to try to take the
internet away from us and then we're not
going to have that they may not even
take it away because the point is it's U
it's just chaos as long as you have an
atomized population if they can take
away organization
interaction you know talking to your
neighbors and so on that leave people
isolated and alone you can throw the
internet at them and they can't do
anything with it right right hey no
thanks so much for being here only
always a pleasure
