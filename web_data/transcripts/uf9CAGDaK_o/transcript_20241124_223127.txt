thank you so so much rome for taking
time out of your
incredibly busy schedule
i was hoping above all that you
could talk about why you believe
that there is still hope why people
shouldn't despair
and give up the signs you've seen
around the world that point to something
that means there is still hope we just
have to get organized we have to get
together
we have to work internationally which we
in our localization work
are completely committed to
what are the signs of hope for you no
well actually we're living in a very
interesting period
the problems we face are worse than
they've ever been
but the basis for working on them
is better than it's been for a long time
i mean questions that the
serious questions that people were
struggling about in the
1960s 1970s
have all been resolved we start from a
higher plane
we don't have to talk anymore about
things that
were very alive then young people
don't know what it was like so take
the united states maybe most advanced
country in the world
in the 1960s it had
federal laws banning blacks
in federally funded housing
women were theoretically
property not people
the british common law still held
there was almost no opposition to the
indochina war you get
famous people like dan rather the
great the top correspondent said in 1968
uh it's not going well we have to do
something
meaning if it were going well if we were
destroying indochina that would be fine
uh that was the general attitude but we
can
easily go on there were a lot of that
has changed we don't
have to argue about those things anymore
now they're
deeper more serious ones okay
that means we start from a plane that's
higher
thanks to the struggles of people before
us
who didn't give up under much harsher
conditions
now where are we well
in the united states we look out the
windows
we see the most extraordinary
protests that have ever taken place
has been it's totally unprecedented
uh there have been protests against
police killings before but they were
localized
some of them were pretty serious had to
call in federal troops to quell the
disorder
but nothing like this all over the
country
and what's more enormous popular support
popular support for the protesters today
is much higher than it was for martin
luther king
at the peak of his popularity let alone
later
that's a big difference you have dozens
of the among of high military officers
including the top people in the military
who are supporting the protests and
condemning
the president for his use of violence to
have a photo
up in front of a church nothing like
this has ever happened
ever okay a week go on but the fact is
we do have this confluence
of the worst problems humans have ever
faced
like the question whether organized
human society can survive
for another generation or two it's a
very life question though
we have problems like that and we have
also more
energy commitment and capacity to deal
with them than ever before
so it's an amazing moment the way i've
been
thinking about this is that i see it as
this
very clear cultural popular
evolution away from
what started with this from the very
beginning this economic system has been
ruthless it was based in
slavery and genocide
misogyny and i
see people culture turning away from
those values
and and not only towards respect for
other cultures of the races
but for everything that lives you know
valuing the lives of animals
a deep caring for life and and
fundamentally for one another
but as i see it what's going unabated is
a
linear projection or progression
in an economic system that has become
more and more large-scale more and more
competitive more and more global and
it's this
techno-economic machine that's driving
the extinction of species extinction of
livelihoods extinction of identities
and extinction of community and so for
us uh trying to recreate
community fabric at the local level
we see as a fundamental cornerstone
of regaining a deeper sense of
who i am you know turning the eye to a
we
being cut off into this little eye but
as we come together at the local
community level
we start becoming whole again we start
becoming more empowered
would you agree with that picture not
only that but i think we're seeing it
develop in quite remarkable ways
right now so one of the
really dramatic consequences of the
coronavirus pandemic is the rise
all over the world of community-based
mutual support groups people getting
together to say
well the government's not going to do
anything for us so we'll get together
and
take care of that man and
living alone in a room who doesn't have
any food
and it's can't get out they will take
care of them
they're mutual and some of them are
amazing like in the
favelas in rio hideous slums
indescribable songs the government
doesn't do anything yes nothing
but the only thing they do is send the
police in every once in a while to kill
people
but there are there's crime all over the
place terrible crime
the crime gangs have organized
to help the people in the favelas
that deal with the crisis they've tried
to
help them separate from one another
to the limited extent it's possible
bring in water or
they don't have water uh help them get
to a doctor if they had to
the criminal gangs in rio that have been
terrorizing the police
are they are getting together with the
people to
deal with the pandemic it is happening
all over
and the same is happening with the black
lives matter protest
um they're focused on the police because
of the killing
but proposals have been coming along as
to what to do about police
and one of them is community control
let's have community-controlled uh
security forces let's do that
in fact most of what the police do the
police should not be doing anyway
like taking care of domestic disputes or
mentally ill people or overdoses these
are for
community service things and in fact
there should be community control of
the whole security forces things like
that are developing
at the same time there's a growth in
response to the
longer term crisis of neoliberal
capitalism which has been devastating
for 40 years
there's a growth of worker-owned
enterprises
collectives community-based
services spreading all over
places like the rust built which have
been
collapsing because bankers in
new york and chicago say they can work
make more profit by
exploiting mexican or chinese workers so
instead of giving up they're
developing new systems that are
integrating into the
rising service economies so for example
in
in ohio big steel center
steel mills were all sent somewhere else
but it's now
the economy is based on hospitals
universities and other things so they
need
laundries for example so a worker
owned and managed laundry cooperatives
has been developed to service the
community
things like that are happening all over
a lot of localism
people saying we want to grow our own
food not
have industrial uh
production of meat industrial or
agribusiness which destroys the soil
we'll do it right here no big
transportation costs we'll
develop our own local systems things
like that are happening
everywhere it's been accelerated
by the reaction to the virus and indeed
the reaction
to the uh the enormous reaction to the
george floyd killing uh of course
at the very same time the people who've
created this system
are relentlessly working to ensure
not only that it persists but that it
develops in a harsher and more cruel
form
they don't stop for a second well uh
everyone is concerned with the
demonstrations in the streets
the trump administration
is carrying forward its policies of
escalating the use of fossil fuels
and deregulation also
quietly they're saying for
some of the things that are happening
kind of below the radar
show the cruelty and savagery of these
systems
so the years ago part of the neoliberal
programs
pensions were virtually eliminated so
people don't have
guaranteed security and if they have
pension programs
they don't pay for uh what was done was
to change
to try to drive people into the market
so
people were compelled i was in fact
my own university to abandon guaranteed
pensions and have what's called a
401k investment in the market
you don't have the slightest idea what's
going on there some
a big management firm somewhere it's
doing things
while the virus is going on eugene
scalia
labor secretary who's a corporate lawyer
with a long record of
anti-labor activity with appointed labor
secretary
a couple days ago he just announced that
the
private equity funds can buy into the
401k so you're now at the mercy
of these predatory uh
institutions whose job is to destroy
whatever they own take it apart get as
much profit as they can and then go
somewhere else
that's what's taking care of what used
to be a pension
okay every minute something like this
is happening quietly clet the
it's a it's a very serious class
war and the
the world is run especially countries
like the united states
by a highly class conscious business
class
doesn't stop for a minute and if they
can
proceed on their course what comes out
of this will be
a worse disaster than what created it
so you have to be conscious all the time
a lot of good things happening
we can extend them we can work for them
there's plenty of opportunities
there's problems of a truly existential
character
that we but we are in a position to deal
with them
not for long incidentally another couple
of decades maybe too late
i completely agree and this is why we're
trying to insist
that we don't shy away from looking at
the problems
and as the system which we see primarily
as the deregulated global machine
of giant monopolies supported by the
financial markets which are now run by
algorithms
and we see this machine-like progression
and the system is what we need to focus
on
and from a global perspective and
collaborating
internationally and at the same time
we're saying
really build up those strong
interdependent
local community initiatives and
because ultimately that's what we need
to do and we're seeing even
as people start doing that they regain a
certain strength
we feel the isolation into the
individual
into the eye has been such a disaster
also in terms of mental illness and i
know you're familiar with johann hari
who's writing your memoir i understand
and
we love his work and his examples
of helping mentally ill people come
together
and even to work the land together and
how this process
heals and and today as you know we have
so many traumatized
people we've got epidemics of depression
among young people across the entire
world because they're being pressured to
go into this city
to fight in that very very
basically sick economic system
working 80 hours a week or there's
nothing there are no alternatives
and we see that the localization
movement which you describe
talking about these new initiatives of
community-owned enterprise also much of
it can be
privately owned but it needs to be
within a scale
where the community sanctions and the
community
surveillance keep this ruthless
exploitation
in check and we basically see
almost everywhere you have genuine
face-to-face
connection you cannot have
maybe i shouldn't say you cannot have
but you almost
never have the brutality that you have
of anonymous systems
and the anonymity of seeing people
as a label as a concept you know when
someone down the street
owns the shop and happens to be from
afghanistan you know him as muhammad
and appreciate what he's doing it's when
you
hear through the mainstream media that
you know they
they every muslim is born as a terrorist
and we have to go in there and
extinguish them
just like we try to exterminate you know
insects and
we think we can exterminate forms of
life we don't like um
so we see the distancing and the
dehumanizing effect as
central in in this monstrous system
which yes the u.s government has been
the
political arm for us of a global
capitalist system that's a driving
destruction around the world
well that's perfectly true you see it in
many ways like one of the
goals of the right wing in the united
states
trump is the extreme example is to
destroy the post office
why because the post office is very
efficient
and it serves people and nobody makes
any profit for me
so why have it what the post office
means is
you go to the post office to pick up
your mail you meet your friends you know
the people there
you talk to them the person who delivers
your mail
you get to know them if somebody's sick
the
mail delivery guy may bring something
for them it
builds up a community of people i mean
i've
lived in rural communities where the
post office was the place where we went
together to meet their friends
so we got to get rid of it that's not
the kind of thing we want
we people we want people to be atomized
separated no security
alone we want actually karl marx
described it
he was talking about the autocratic
rulers of
europe he said they want to turn the
population
into a sack of potatoes atomized
isolated passive no resistance
under control that's reagan and thatcher
and the 40 years that they've initiated
and uh we're suffering from it
but we're resisting it people are
resisting it
great to talk to you so thank you so so
much noah really appreciate it
