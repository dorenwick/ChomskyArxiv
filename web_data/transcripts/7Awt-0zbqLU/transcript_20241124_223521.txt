greetings we're here with Professor Nom
tomsky of MIT the world's most quoted
living author and to me it should make
one wonder how censored our media really
is I mean here the man is the most
quoted living author he's world renowned
in both Linguistics and his political
activism and yet with all these
political shows we have on TV how often
have you seen them on I want to talk
today about marijuana versus
tobacco so actually what I'm gonna do is
not really ask a question but have a
discussion and I I opened up with that
and I'm going to give it to you there if
you compare tobacco and
marijuana some of the facts are very
clear I tobacco is a huge killer it's uh
one of the major killers there is among
drugs it's far away the worst deaths
from passive smoking you know being
exposed to smoke are considerably higher
than the deaths from our drug over does
and of course active smoking is far
worse somebody with nicotine you can see
like maybe they're taking a break at a
storm they're quick getting that in
whereas cannabis doesn't seem to have
that monkey associated with it and maybe
you could start that uh with the um
Harry anslinger who started that whole
uh Crusade against this other plan Story
I mean what basically happened is
that after provis was ended the Bureau
of Narcotics had a big staff huge
bureaucracy had to do something so they
uh grabbed onto marijuana and at first
there was a a lot of Hysteria about
there actually were Senate hearings but
they were kind of a joke the the
American Medical Association did
participate but they said nobody has any
evidence that this is that's probably
not good for you a lot of other things
aren't either it's no evidence it's
really harmful but they did get
some very dubious evidence that uh it
drove people
insane uh and this they really had
evidence for this because testimony oh
testimon because I know that like mayor
LaGuardia had study done afterward never
find any serious and plus it could
actually help people who have AIDS and
and cancer know cases of people with
cancer who couldn't whose diets whose
food intake was declining stimulat
appeti say that the best thing to do is
marijuana you can't use it right but but
the point with anslinger is with they
needed something They seized on these uh
hysterical claims about driving people
insane you know those horrible things
are going to happen to
you was not uh that they had evidence
that it was harmful it was again a class
issue uh marijuana was picked basically
for two reasons uh it was used at first
by Mexicans and there was a lot of anti
Mexican discrimination exactly and then
it was used by uh by blacks black
artists in the Harlem Renaissance and so
on
this was picked again pretty much on
Class A Class basis the criminal
population is mostly black males later
yeah that's another Hispanics recording
Obama was asked this question which I
have here at least this came out of I
guess it came out of originally the
globe in mail that's out of Canada yeah
okay at the beginning of the Forum
President Obama stated quote when
running for president I promised to open
up the White House to the American
people and this event which is being
streamed over the Internet marks an
important step towards that goal end
quote here's how he answered the
question I mean he didn't really even no
he just made out of it
yeah 3.5 million people voted I have to
say that there was one question that was
voted on that that ranked fairly High uh
and that was whether legalizing
marijuana would improve uh the economy
and job
creation and
uh uh I don't know what this says about
the online
audience
but but I I just want uh I don't want
people to think that uh this was a
fairly popular question we want to make
sure that it was answered uh the answer
is no I don't think that is a good
strategy to grow our economy so and
picked audience Obama wasn't asked if he
thought legalizing marijuana would
stimulate the economy he was told it
would everyone knows that or should
anyway he was asked if he would do
something about it but never answered
the question he was
asked it's not a joke criminalization in
the United States even a lot of it is
drug related but the whole system that's
developed particularly in the last 30
years but it's bad enough when you go
further back uh is unusually Savage by
World
standard if our president want to change
I mean here we're deciding what humans
are so dangerous to society that they
have to be put in a
cage that should be serious I don't
think people realize too is if a parent
is sent to jail or prison that's like
orphaning children I mean you know Dad
mommy or daddy's being put in a cage I
hope that Obama gets to have a second
thought about all this is what I'm
hoping so we could have a better world
and change could be possible and the
other day I was talking to somebody and
I said I was coming up here to talk to
you and he said oh he's really far left
I said no he's
rational the criminal population is
mostly black
males
Hispanics marijuana was picked basically
for two reasons uh it was used at first
by Mexicans and there was a lot of anti
Mexican discrimination exactly and then
it was used by by blacks black artists
in the Harlem Renaissance and so
on it's not a
joke it's not a
joke
