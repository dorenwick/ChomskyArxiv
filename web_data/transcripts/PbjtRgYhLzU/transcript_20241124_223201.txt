all right uh welcome everybody
uh wow big day and I just want to say a
few things to get us started uh it is of
course a tremendous honor and I should
say a thrill to be able to introduce
Professor Noam Chomsky to give the
formal inaugural lecture here at karate
Hall I had the opportunity to introduce
uh Professor Chomsky 13 and a half years
ago when he gave the inaugural lecture
Ed Gordon
he's the only person that we deem worthy
of giving these kinds of lectures and I
am getting my second shot at introducing
maybe the one person in the world who
truly needs no introduction
I will nevertheless take the opportunity
to make a few observations Superfluous
though they may be
the first is to point out the obvious
connection between Professor chomsky's
life work as a public intellectual and
the tradition of political economy here
at UMass
that is Professor Chomsky has been for
over 50 years a firm powerful Relentless
and Incredibly effective voice for
social economic ecological Justice and
Sanity in the United States and in the
world
this is of course in addition
to his real job his fundamental
scientific research in linguistic
psychology cognitive science and
philosophy
our economics program and Perry have
also been committed to social economic
and ecological ecological Justice for
almost as long as Professor Chomsky and
the connection is not just that we share
these fundamental commitments to human
well-being but that at our best we are
at UMass try to uphold the Chomsky
standard of being as honest Relentless
and rigorous in our work as possible
doing anything less means that we are
not really doing all we can to advance
social and economic Justice whatever our
sentiments might be
how Professor Chomsky has made his
contributions to human well-being is an
incredible story of one person putting
his very big brain an equally big heart
to good use
how you Mass economics and Perry came to
be what we are is a more convoluted
story involving a whole lot of committed
talented and Visionary people this
includes many members of the UMass
Administration some of whom are here
right now
that is why Gordon Hall was named in
part for our former Dean Glenn Gordon
along with the late great political
Economist David Gordon we might have
even named karate Hall in part for our
Dean Bob Feldman who was so instrumental
in creating karate Hall the only problem
was that his last name didn't happen to
be karate
the founders of the UMass economics
program as we
today includes of course samples herb
dentists Steve Resnick Rick wolf Rick
Edwards and Leonard rapping it also
includes Don katzner who is still going
full speed in our program and who has
written a great history of our
department Don was not part of the
radical faction that came in with
samples and the rest of the initiate
initial group but he was open to this
group and he embraced diversity without
Don and a few others like him the
program would never have flourished and
of course the story also involves Jim
Crotty
now Jim karate has received a healthy
share of well-deserved praise over the
past few months with the creation and
opening of karate Hall and we have seen
his head get a little bit bigger each
time
um
but what hasn't been said enough is that
the contributions of Jim Crotty and the
other founders of the program have
created a daunting challenge for those
of us that have come after them and are
forced to try to live up to what they
have created it's very hard indeed but
nevertheless something that needs to be
done all we have to do is look around at
what is going on in virtually every
other economics program in the U.S to
realize that we truly need to carry on
this tradition as effectively as we can
hopefully that job has gotten a bit less
difficult with the opening of karate
Hall
this is a beautiful new building
designed by Professor Sigrid Miller
Poland that should give people in it the
opportunity to work hard and flourish
but karate Hall also creates a great
fallback position even for people who
choose not to work hard in Flash
that is all they have to do is not show
up at the office and they will be
contributing to reducing energy
consumption in the building
and therefore maintaining it as the
first net zero emissions building at
UMass and according to our energy
engineer only the 20th such building in
the whole United States
before actually letting Professor
Chomsky uh talk I would like to just
mention one other thing about him that
maybe people don't know as well as his
scientific and intellectual
contributions and that is his generosity
as a person
some of us have heard stories about all
the people that he writes letters to in
response and that he's so open to anyone
and I can tell you that it's all true
because I experienced it
and I experienced it first I was 22 and
I just read his book with Edward Herman
called the political economy of Human
Rights and I just wrote him a letter and
this is before email and it was a letter
and I just sent the letter to his
publisher and of course never expected
to hear anything back and two weeks
later I got like a letter back that was
longer than the letter I had written
and uh Professor Chomsky uh went into
detail on all the questions I asked and
then some and this again was to somebody
he had no idea who I was I was just
somebody out there writing him a letter
and uh this is the story that people
have told over and over again and the
last time when he spoke at Gordon Hall
and did also what he's going to do today
which is give a second lecture to
thousands
um the last time after he finished I
walked him to his car I said well you
must be really exhausted and uh you'll
be lucky to get home and get to sleep he
said oh no when I get home I'm going to
answer probably 85 emails uh so that is
Noam Chomsky and we are so fortunate to
have him and his wife Valeria here today
thank you very much
thank you
is it is this working yeah is it too
early to file an application to dedicate
the building over there
uh part way through the current
experiment with the neoliberalism Jim
Crotty provided an accounting of the
record over at that time two decades of
global economic performance since the
onset of the neoliberal Revolution and
I'll just quote the accounting
I wish it had been an Epitaph but it was
just an accounting they said the
evidence today supports neoliberals
neoliberalisms critics this is
incidentally 2003 the promised benefits
of neoliberalism have yet to materialize
at least for the majority of the world's
people Global income growth has slowed
as has the rate of growth of capital
accumulation productivity growth has
deteriorated real wage growth has
declined inequality has risen in most
countries real interest rates are higher
Financial crises erupt with increasing
regularity the less developed Nations
outside of East Asia have fallen even
further behind the more advanced and
average unemployment has risen East Asia
of course is the region that didn't
follow the rules
uh other analysts since have drawn
similar conclusions the overall record
was reviewed recently in a careful
analysis by Mark weisbrot Dean Baker
David rosnik of the center for economic
and policy research they compare the
Washington consensus years
1980 to 2005 in their analysis to the
prior two decades 1960 to 1980 and they
found them quoting that contrary to
popular belief the past 25 years 1980
2005 have seen a sharply slower rate of
economic growth and reduced progress on
social indicators for the vast majority
of low and middle income countries
uh the latter of course is the
anticipated consequence of the
neoliberal programs of privatizing State
functions and it's not just true of the
uh low and middle income countries we
see it very clearly in the United States
among the oecd countries the UI U.S
ranks just about at the bottom of 30 or
so in social justice measures ranks
alongside Turkey Greece and Mexico and
there's no need to review the well-known
Scandal of
U.S health care which incidentally is in
a violation of popular will which
continues to the present remarkably to
support Universal Health Care despite
virtually no articulate advocacy of this
sane stand so quite recent polls once
again revealed
well recall that these assessments are
all they're covering the period before
the great crash this is the period of
the celebration of the great moderation
the Triumph of efficient market and
rational expectations Theory the virtual
worship of Saint Alan perhaps the
greatest Economist since at Smith and to
his credit the Greenspan did keep a
close eye on the economy
in 1997 testimony to the Senate Banking
Committee Greenspan recognized in his
words
atypical restraint on compensation
increases has been evident for a few
years now and appears to be mainly the
consequence of Greater worker insecurity
insecurity that as he noted was markedly
increasing at that time even as
employment prospects improved so it was
deeply rooted
Greenspan predicted that these benign
conditions of Greater worker insecurity
would be only temporary and as he put it
suppressed wage cost growth as a
consequence of job insecurity that could
not last now he was mistaken about that
Ten Years Later in 2007 real wages for
non-supervisory American workers that
were actually lower than they had been
in 1979 when the neoliberal experiment
the current one was just taking off
that's a pretty remarkable record over
30 years I think it may be unprecedented
and recall that 2007 was the peak of
euphoria and so congratulations right
before the entire intellectual evidence
edifice crashed to the ground
well other consequences of Greater
worker insecurity have recently come to
light
I'm sure you've read about them one of
them an interesting one followed
immediately after Greenspan's Senate
testimony in 1997 that's the dramatic
increase in mortality among middle-aged
white Americans without college degrees
beginning in 1999
recently documented by Anne case and
Angus Deaton it's a phenomenon unknown
apart from war and pestilence they have
an updated current analysis where they
attribute the increase in mortality to
Despair and loss of status of working
people under the neoliberal miracle
which are concomitants of heightened
worker insecurity
another such effect reached
International prominence in November
2017.
when the same sect 16 when the same
sectors of the population that are
suffering increased mortality a turn for
rescue to their bitter class enemy out
of understandable but self-destructed
self-destructive desperation
and the consequences for working people
are now being exhibited behind the
facade of trump Bannon Spicer
luster before the cameras these is the
systematic enactment of the Orion
legislative programs which are unusually
Savage even for the ultra right and
that's probably worse to come as further
blows the working people are authorized
by the Trump Roberts Court which is soon
going to address the friedrich's case
and now with of course John Borden will
probably destroy decide to destroy
public sector unions on fraudulent
libertarian grounds well just to show
how far we've advanced in this respect
during the neoliberal era and we might
listen to the words of Dwight Eisenhower
when he was running for president in
1952 now here's what he had to say
I have no use for those regardless of
their political party who hold some
foolish dream of spinning the clock back
to days when unorganized labor
unorganized labor was a huddled almost
helpless mass today in America unions
have a secure place in our industrial
life only a handful of unreconstructed
reactionaries Harbor the ugly thought of
breaking unions only a fool would try to
deprive working men and women of the
right to join the union of their choice
that's conservatism vintage 1952 the
days of the golden age of regulated
State capitalism
so we've come a long way since then
well Europe has not been spared the Lash
of neoliberalism that particularly after
the 2008 crash in which unleashed the
austerity programs of the Troika the IMF
the ECB and the European Commission
the severe and harmful effects of these
programs particularly on the more
vulnerable European periphery have been
very aptly documented and excellent work
by Mark Bliss Janus orifakis and Mark
weisbrot among others and the policies
have been criticized as economically
observed even by IMF economists that's
IMF economists the IMF bureaucrats in
the Troika I listened to different
voices mainly the northern Banks
Mark weisbrot's investigations are
particularly interesting he provided in
his recent book failed he provided clear
evidence of a political agenda that's
guiding the destructive economic
policies he did something quite
interesting he investigated the reports
of the regular IMF consultations with
member governments this covers 27
countries for the years 2008 to 2011. he
stopped in 2011 because right after that
in 2012
ECB president Mario draghi uttered the
magic words that ended the recurrent
crises of the euro stated that the ECB
would do whatever it takes to preserve
the Euro and believe me it will be
enough in fact the words alone were
enough no Acts were necessary as had
been evident from the outset
in the years before the magic words the
weissbrot discovered what he called a
remarkably consistent and disturbing
pattern
from these IMF government
discussions regular discussions
consultations
he found and documents that the crisis
was exploited as an opportunity to lock
in the neoliberal reforms spending cuts
in the public sector rather than tax
increases reduced benefits and public
services at pets and Health Care
undermining of collective bargaining and
in general moving to create a society as
he describes it with less bargaining
power for labor lower wages more
inequality in poverty a smaller
government and social safety nets and
measures that reduce growth and
employment the IMF papers
weisbrook includes detail the agenda of
Europe's decision makers and they have
accomplished quite a lot
in this respect over the past five years
the agenda is quite familiar here and in
fact everywhere where the neoliberal
assault has proceeded
of course populations would not vote for
these so-called reforms as White Spot
points out and is quite obvious and that
requires another element of the
neoliberal program to be instituted
democracy must be sacrificed on the
altar of locking in the neoliberal
reforms and the device in Europe is
quite straightforward simply transfer
decision making to unelected bodies all
three members of the Troika including
the European commission are of course
unelected
at the ideological level there's also an
assault necessary the idea that people
should have a role in determining their
social and economic fate is one of the
victims of neoliberal Doctrine
necessarily that's been revealed with
unusual Clarity in Europe particularly
when the Greek government dared to ask
the opinion of the population about
whether they agree that Greece should
continue to be destroyed by so-called
bailouts which in fact passed through
Greece without impact to pay off
Northern banks for their incompetence in
providing careless and risky loans while
Greece's debt burden actually increases
relative to GDP and the country is
ruined
not unfamiliar here either in a
different form
the reaction among European Elites when
the Greek government called for a
referendum was utter outrage and it got
even more intense when the population
voted the wrong way and the Greeks were
sternly punished for their illusion that
the democracy might have a place in
neoliberal Europe even in the country of
its birth
the Troika conditions were made even
harsher in reaction to this deviation
from good order
uh the there is of course a public
response to the neoliberals assault in
Europe has some resemblance to what's
been happening here uh Centrist
political institutions are discredited
public disillusionment fear anger are
running High sometimes taking quite
ominous forms much more ominous in
Europe than here in fact those
who are old enough to remember the 1930s
as I do in fact I cannot fail to be
alarmed at the rise of neo-fascist
parties even in Austria and Germany of
all places and not only there and bitter
memories are not easy to suppress when a
majority of Europeans call for Banning
of all Muslims from Europe and many want
to reverse the real achievements of the
European Union such as free movement of
populations and erosion of national
borders which is incidentally quite
consistent with strengthening of
cultural diversity
well we can't attribute all of these
developments across the West to the
neoliberal assault but it is a common
and I think clearly significant factor
in the U.S too in the United States too
functioning democracy has declined under
the neoliberal assault this is
these are developments that are revealed
with particularly in detailed Studies by
Martin gillen's Ben Paige Larry Bartlett
a couple of other political scientists
the results show that
the majority of the population about 70
percent lower 70 percent on the income
scale are literally disenfranchised that
is their representatives pay no
attention whatsoever to their attitudes
and preferences As you move up the scale
you get a little more influence and at
the very top of policies are set by a
fraction of one percent
the significance of these results was
has been further underscored by uh
recent work by Tom Ferguson and his
colleagues this is extending Ferguson's
investment theory of politics
to a new domain Congressional elections
since 1980 neoliberal years and the
studies show something pretty
astonishing they show that this is house
in the Senate they show the campaign
spending is a near perfect predictor of
electoral outcomes if you take a look at
the study it's literally a straight line
effect over all of these years these are
results you don't find in the social
sciences maybe in quantum physics but
then it appears to be enhanced by The
neoliberal Assault on Democracy which is
reasonable because it's implicit in the
general principles as you see also in
Europe
well of course there has been resistance
to the neoliberal assault particularly
in Latin America the center-left
governments that took power during this
Millennium has gone a considerable way
towards reversing the Lost decades as
they're called of the neoliberal years
the structural adjustment years the
Washington consensus years one
consequence and I think an important and
Lasting one is that the IMF which is
basically an agency of the U.S treasury
in Latin America has been expelled
is gone gives loans to Europe now
and also all your U.S military bases
have been expelled from South America
even Colombia surprisingly there has
been some progress in reversing the harm
caused by the Washington consensus
programs of the Lost decades
regrettably there have also been severe
failures resulting from theism
corruption and Reliance on an
unsustainable extractivist model which
as a side effect undermines domestic
development so you import export soy and
import Chinese manufacturers which
destroys your own manufacturing base
and so on one of the better records is
in Ecuador
where poverty has been reduced by almost
40 percent and extreme poverty by almost
50 percent along with notable reduction
in inequality birth of per capita income
substantial increase in Social spending
and access to health care and education
and elsewhere too there have been
advances that may be sustainable despite
the current regression
well not every Latin American country
participated in the reversal of the
neoliberal assault or
reforms is there to use the preferred
term uh one prime exception is Mexico
which was subjected to a policy decision
called NAFTA which had the express
purpose literal purpose of locking
Mexico in to the structural reforms of
the 1980s and the effects
happen to be reviewed in a recent CPR
study it finds that Mexico ranks 15th
out of 20 Latin American countries in
growth of real GDP per person real wages
are the same in 2014 when the study ends
as in 1994 when NAFTA was instituted the
poverty rate has barely budged while in
the rest of the region poverty declined
from 44 in 2002 to 28 percent in 20 14
and there's a string of other results
which confirm the general assessment of
the neoliberal programs
the modern experiment with neoliberalism
was initiated in Chile after the
Pinochet coup in 1973
overthrew the ayanda government and
installed a harsh dictatorship and
that's uh called in Chile the first 9 11
took place in 9 11 1973.
and what happened is quite informative
about what followed worldwide and about
the essence of these programs before
going into that we might pause for a
moment to compare the two 911s and the
first one in 1973 the second in 2001 and
the easiest way to compare them is with
a simple thought experiment so imagine
that in 911 2001 the plane that was
downed in Pennsylvania
had actually reached its Target
presumably the White House killed the
president instituted a carefully planned
military dictatorship which murdered
some 50 to 100 000 people and tortured
seven hundred thousand and established a
global Terror center now that would of
course been far worse than what happened
in September twenty
2001 and it is indeed what did happen in
September
1973. I've changed the figures only to
per capita equivalence which is the
appropriate measure well the second 911
was celebrated by Al Qaeda it's far more
horrendous precursor was also celebrated
by the United States government and the
business World these are facts worth
pondering but let's put that topic aside
the U.S had of course strongly opposed
the ayanda government and it celebrated
the new military dictatorship with
enthusiasm
among other punishments loans had been
withheld During the period of Chilean
democracy but 9 11
1973 pulled the cork out of the bottle
now there was a flood of loans from the
World Bank and private investors the new
military rulers were praised by U.S
Secretary of Treasury William Simon for
having brought economic freedom to Chile
the applause was reminiscent of
Washington's reaction to the military
coup in Brazil in 1964. that established
the first of the Neo-Nazi Terror and
torture states that spread like a
hideous plague across the hemisphere of
the curse reaching Central America in
the 1980s John F Kennedy's Ambassador
Lincoln Gordon explained that Washington
supported the military forces that
overthrew parliamentary democracy in
recognition and quoting in recognition
of their basically Democratic and
pro-united States orientation those two
terms are synonymous well the torturers
and the Assassins were carrying out
their necessary work of cleansing the
society Gordon held their achievement as
the most decisive victory for freedom in
the mid 20th century now remember this
is the left of the political spectrum
that we're talking about
the Democratic Rebellion as Gordon
called it he then cabled Washington
would also help in restraining left-wing
excesses of the former moderate elected
government and the Democratic forces now
in charge should create a greatly
improved climate for private investment
the bottom line
the United States is a global power we
mislead ourselves when we tend to focus
on a particular area we should think
globally and policies and attitudes tend
to be consistent worldwide for that
reason so we shouldn't be at all
surprised at the discovery that at the
very same time
1965 U.S liberal opinion was welcoming
with unrestrained joy at what it
recognized to be um quoting the New York
Times The Staggering Mass Slaughter in
Indonesia that murdered hundreds of
thousands of people destroyed the
political system
and instituted a vicious dictatorship
which opened the rich resources of the
country to private investment it was a
gleam of light in Asia as it was
described by New York Times columnist
James Reston again at the left
articulating the common view
and it generalizes you can find case
after case which is quite similar well
the piano shade dictatorship going back
to that they brought in the famous
Chicago boys uh economists who were
trained in the doctrines of the leading
proponents of neoliberalism and they had
perfect experimental conditions there
could have been no objections because of
the brutality of the dictatorship that
overwhelming support from the
hemispheric superpower and the
institutions it dominates like the World
Bank and furthermore and quite crucially
the so-called free market economy could
rely on a highly efficient state-owned
copper producer kedelco which is a
Mainstay of the economy that the
dictatorship didn't dare to touch it's
worth remembering in this connection
that although neoliberalism proclaims
its allegiance to free market and Free
Trade Practices quite different as the
Chilean example illustrates Reagan was
much the same much lofty rhetoric about
free markets but quick resort to extreme
protectionism to save American
Industries from more Advanced and
successful Japanese competitors
Automobiles and semiconductors and
others sometimes these were called
voluntary export restrictions where
voluntary means to do what we say or
else
as the more recent as for the more
recent free trade agreements take a look
at them these are root the highly
protectionist investor rights agreements
well the Chicago boys who had free reign
and perfect conditions proceeded to
impose the theormet theoretical model
that they had been taught I never
visited by Leading figures Milton
Friedman and Arnold harburger both of
whom made a series of
well-publicized appearances to promote
what they called a shock treatment for
the economy
words shock therapy rapid imposition of
Market systems is the only medicine
absolutely there's no other there is no
other long-term solution
well the experiment
went on for a few years by 1982 the
results of the experiment were in the
economy completely crashed uh note in
1982 that happens the year of the
collapse of the perfect experiment it
was also the year in which Friedman
reissued his classic Manifesto
capitalism and freedom with a new
Preface on the Triumph of the neoliberal
model
well in Chile in order to salvage
something from the neoliberal wreckage
the state had to take over a large part
of the economy this is that one
prominent Chilean Economist who studied
this carefully Gabriel Palma points out
that the Pinochet government ended up
with a share of the economy far greater
than the allendes government ever
dreamed of basically the whole of the
banking system ended up owned by the
government and a large share of the real
sector as well including export
activities Manufacturing Services and so
on this was some of you may remember
that this was called at the time the
Chicago Road to socialism
finish it then
recognized the disaster he sacked the
Chicago boys he brought in entrepreneurs
of the traditional old right to try to
set the economy back to some kind of
functioning
as it does still relying very heavily on
copper and
in particular
there were the there is a
post-dictatorship the post-dictatorship
years have been mostly Center left
governments Elites that are left
governments which did introduce some
improvements particularly during
bachelor's year terms but there's a
recent scholarly review just came out a
couple of weeks ago which points out
goes through the details and points out
that none of the reforms dismantled the
underlying structures put in place by
the military dictatorship and in fact
there have been constant and in recent
years very vigorous protests public
protests over the privatized pension
health and Educational Systems which are
failing most of the population most not
the very rich and not the military and
the police because Spanish it was very
careful to ensure that they would be
protected by the former State Pension
system
well the Chilean experiment with
neoliberalism and shock therapy was soon
followed by others of the most
significant one was after the collapse
of the Soviet Union U.S advisors moved
in administered shock therapy and
according word with neoliberal
principles imposition of privatization
the control of prices General market
doctrines and the result was the
familiar one economic collapse a loss of
about half of Russia's GDP in five years
also a sharp increase in the death rate
reaching millions of excess deaths in
the 1980s and robbery of State assets on
a colossal scale
largely by the old operatics leading to
the corrupt oligarchy in the Putin
reactions so that's another brand
success and as we've seen hardly on
typical
or for that matter hardly surprising I
mean I began by saying that the Chilean
dictatorship opened the first modern
experiment with neoliberalism and the
reason for the qualification modern is
that it's not really new in a similar
socioeconomic regimes have been imposed
by Imperial powers for centuries pretty
much creating the third world and in
fact neoliberalism is a strange term in
many respects it's not new that's not
particularly liberal even in the
technical economic sense the Delco
example is perfect the normal case well
there's no time to review the historical
record which is indeed quite interesting
and remarkably consistent what it
reveals is that quite generally from
England to the United States to Japan
Japan incidentally the one country the
global South that was not colonized and
not by accident the one country that
developed uh and that rejected the
neoliberal principles from England all
the way through to the East Asian tigers
the countries that have developed are
those that simply rejected the
neoliberal principles for the United
States as I'm sure you know these were
advised by no less an economists than
Adam Smith who advised the new Republic
to follow the principles of sound
economics to
concentrate on what they're good at what
was later called comparative advantage
to
import Superior manufactured goods from
England
crucially not to try to monopolize the
products that they had a an advantage in
The crucial one of course was cotton the
fuel of the Industrial Revolution
and if the policies had been followed
the United States would be part of the
third world but they were instantly
rejected
the Hamilton model immediately imposed
the highest protectionist tariffs in the
world and enabled the development of a
textile industry of manufacturing and
later in the century steel industry and
in fact the U.S also saw it and almost
succeeded in monopolizing cotton
that was critical and the reasoning was
very explicit you go to the Jacksonian
president's Polk and Tyler they were
quite explicit at the fact that if we
can monopolize cotton we can bring
England to our feet I remember England
was the big enemy in those days and that
they picked the great power and if we
could only get a monopoly of cotton we
could ensure that England would not get
in their way would do what we want they
came pretty close not quite because
England at the time of its own
ballet and with the market principles
decided that it would conquer the rest
of India so that it could try to gain a
substantial amount of cotton and of
course also get control of the Opium
that it could use to batter its way into
China which didn't want British
manufacturing goods and that's all
called free market principles and
economic history but that's essentially
the typical record goes right on to the
present uh the United States was
independent it followed England's model
of state-led development and
protectionism
what we now call robbing Superior
technology from others in England's case
from India from Ireland and the low
countries the U.S case from India from
England and
there was as I say some dallying with
free trade now and then when it looked
as if it would be advantageous these are
the countries that were free from
Imperial domination the countries that
were under Imperial domination were
compelled by force to pursue these
doctrines and they became the third
world
individual cases are quite interesting
to look at there's no time but just to
take one
in the United States
new United States and Egypt were pretty
similar in the early 19th century they
both had ample resources of cotton the
basis for the Industrial Revolution
Egypt was a rich agricultural country
that's why Napoleon conquered it Egypt
had a developmental leader Muhammad Ali
was planning to pursue the course of
development that the United States
successfully did and that England had
done before it I bet it was one
difference the United States was
independent
Egypt was under British rule and Lord
palmist and others made it very clear
that they were not going to tolerate an
independent economy in the Eastern
Mediterranean so they blocked it by
force
when will go on with the rest of the
story but it goes on up to even U.S
intervention in the post-second world
era so Egypt is Egypt and the United
States is the United States and there
are many similar pairs which are quite
interesting to look at
so just take one African historians
including a British African historians
battle Davidson famous African historian
have argued with some plausibility that
the West African Ashanti Kingdom in the
mid-19th century was quite similar to
Japan in the level of economic and
social development and policy formation
and so on again with one critical
difference the usual one
Mr pan Africa is Africa well history is
a complicated matter and there are many
obscure interactions but these are among
the clearest lessons that economic
history provides and they're known to
mainstream economic historians so among
others polled by rosh aptly documents
his conclusion that it's difficult to
find another case where the facts so
contradict the dominant Theory as the
doctrine that free markets are the
engine of growth
uh there have been some notable
successes of the modern experiment with
neoliberal reforms
recall that these were instituted back
in the 70s in large part in order to
arrest the declining rate of profit
which was due to more popular power
particularly labor power during the
activist years of the 60s and that's
been achieved profitability has been
restored particularly in the largely
predatory financial institutions which
have exploded during the neoliberal
years and are now even bigger and richer
than they were before the 2008 financial
crisis for which they were largely
responsible and is in the normal
neoliberal fashion they are happy to
rely on extensive public subsidy there
was an IMF study a couple of years ago
which investigated the profits of the
six biggest American Banks and concluded
that they come almost entirely from the
implicit government insurance policy
which is not just the bailouts but
access to cheap credit and easy funding
and so on
incentives to take risky and it's
profitable
transactions because if you get in
trouble the taxpayer will bail you out
and so on the business press Bloomberg
estimated that looking at the IMF study
estimated the annual subsidy at about
over 80 billion dollars a year which
sounds high but isn't really another IMF
study found that the fossil fuel
Industries get about a 700 billion
dollar a year subsidy that's free market
in the
really existing capitalist democracy
well but there have been notable
successes the
financial institutions have exploded
they're very wealthy bigger than before
inequalities increased the rate of
profits increased and there are other
successes that are insufficiently
appreciated and should be looked at much
more carefully in fact some of them have
been studied carefully by political
economists Sean stars and recent work of
his country at MIT
he points out that the conventional
estimates of national wealth in terms of
GDP are quite misleading in the era of
neoliberal globalization
there's an ERA with complex integrated
Supply chains
subcontracting all sorts of other
devices and in this system he discovered
a corporate ownership of the world's
wealth is becoming a much more realistic
measure of global power than National
wealth as the world departs even more
than before from the model of nationally
discrete political economies so he did a
detailed investigation of corporate
ownership
using Credit Suisse and other sources
and he found that in virtually every
economic sector
manufacturing Finance Services retail
and others the U.S corporations are well
in the lead in ownership of the global
economy either first or occasionally
second
nobody else is even close over overall
U.S corporate ownership of the global
economy is close to 50 percent of the
total World economy notice that that's
roughly the maximum estimate of U.S
national wealth in 1945 that was the
historical peak of U.S power will
National U.S wealth by conventional
measures has declined from 1945 to the
present maybe 20 percent or so today but
U.S corporate ownership of the world has
exploded and the the multinationals of
course are nationally based supported
and subsidized by the national taxpayer
so in some respects all is quite well
neoliberalism has been a grand success
and they can end by quoting the head of
state of Brazil's military dictatorship
in general Emilio Medici
1971 and he said the economy is doing
fine but the people aren't which is
perhaps the simplest one sentence
accounting of neoliberalism
as you all know Professor chomsky's
going to be giving another lecture
at 7 30 so we will not keep them too
long but we don't want to abuse your
generosity but some questions they're
not do you want reasons calling people
do you sure okay David uh do you see any
uh potentially serious challenges to the
current order on Verizon at this time no
in the United States in the world
everywhere
everyone the challenges are very well
let me move over let's take the United
States uh the most one of the most
remarkable developments in the last
couple of months was the Bernie Sanders
campaign
it was quite astonishing I mean I quoted
Tom Ferguson's discussion of
congressional elections but it's much
more general for over a century American
elections have been bought
you can almost completely predict uh
electoral outcomes and policy by simply
looking at things like campaign funding
and the coalitions of investors as a
Ferguson puts it to coalesce to invest
to control the state it's a remarkably
close prediction
the problems discussed in this book
Golden Rule many other studies this
recent one extends it that's over a
century and it's been well known
so you go back to 1895 the great
campaign manager of the day Mark Hannah
was asked once what it takes to run a
successful campaign he said it takes two
things the first one is money and I've
forgotten what the second is that was
1895 long before citizens united right
that now let's come to last November uh
a guy came up from nowhere no one ever
heard of him no corporate funding no
wealthy funding that the media hated him
and disparaged and he even used the
scare word socialist which meant
basically a new deal Democrat Eisenhower
wouldn't have been surprised by his
programs but
he probably would have won the
Democratic nomination if it hadn't been
for the Obama Clinton Shenanigans and
managing the party he might have won the
election it's a radical break from the
American political tradition and it goes
beyond
thanks to Fox News of all people we have
an account of the most of the relative
popularity of the political figures in
the United States
Sanders is way in the lead nobody else
was even close and among young people
much higher than anyone else well that's
the basis for a kind of resistance there
are plenty of possibilities and similar
things are happening in Europe
so I mentioned the quite ominous
right-wing developments but there are
others
padamus Jeremy corbyn uh
Vero focuses movement again 25 these are
all alive and well they could respond
Latin America was the case that had the
most successful resistance there's
regression but that's not over so I
think there's plenty of possibilities
so how would you place trumpism into
this story if you'd see it as a
continuation trumpisms
story do you see it as something
different of our right-handing
neo-fascist
uh assault on this or how do you how
many places
I think it does Trump too much credit to
call them neo-fascist to be a
neo-fascist you have to have an ideology
and as far as I can see his ideology is
simply me
I mean there are forces that he's
awakened I mean they're not really
awakened they're already there but kind
of opened the door for which are pretty
dangerous but I don't think I mean in my
feeling at least the threat of
neo-fascism is much greater in Europe
where it has a history of basis an
Institutional basis could come back I I
think what's happening here or somewhat
different
I think it's it is pretty much what
Jason Eaton pointed out desperation
um there are people there's all kind of
factors one factor is evangelical
Christianity which is a huge phenomenon
in the United States and it hadn't been
uh it's become essentially the base of
the Republican Party the Republican
party went so far to the right that they
can't get votes on their actual policies
nobody's going to vote for the Orion
legislative program so they've had to
mobilize people on other grounds a
nationalist
Ultra religious and so on and that's
that's there but a large part of the
slight swing and it was pretty slight in
the last election was a working class
lower middle class not a very poor but
people who have lost their hope their
dignity their sense of self-worth and
see the whole world is against them
they're being attacked from below by
worthless people who as they see it are
being helped by the federal government
attacked from above by the rich people
are taking everything don't have jobs
there's
social status has gone immortality is
increasing
desperations increasing so they turn to
their class anime where else are they
going to go the Democratic party
abandoned the working class 40 years ago
in fact a lot of these people voted for
Obama believing the rhetoric about Hope
and change okay no hope no change by
2010 right here in Massachusetts there
was already a reversal a lot of Union
households voted for brown in 2010 of
the Kennedy you know in the on the seat
that Kennedy had it was quite a change
in the studies of their voting showed
that a lot of it was just anger at Obama
attacking their
the rights that they had struggled for
like Health rights and he wasn't doing
anything for them so they turned to
Brown this time they turned to Trump
what's going to be interesting to see
and could lead to something like
neo-fascism I think is what will happen
when the con game collapses
sooner or later
working people are going to see that the
programs that are being instituted are
directed against them
Case by case you know it's kind of
hidden behind the Bluster the
you take a look at the programs the Ryan
style programs it's exactly what they
are so sooner or later that game is
going to collapse and then what happens
Escape coding
maybe some wild action maybe the kind of
thing that could
Inspire some kind of
Ultra right xenophobic movement
the what I was supposed to be the
comfortable to the United States such as
the Brazil of Russia India and China was
supposed to be sort of countering the
might the United States are in such
domestic message right now in terms of
just their politics and their economies
and again a lot of these places nobody
saw it coming the kind of situation that
they're in right now this kind of
situation who's in
um these countries which countries
the bridge
well Russia has put in and you know
well the I'm in the uh you know the real
incentive behind bricks was Brazil
it was
a social armor rims foreign policy when
he was the foreign minister for the
little government actually he's touring
around the United States now with
talking about a very interesting Memoir
of his that just came out which you
might want to look at it's called the
Global
acting globally acting globally just
appeared in English and it appeared and
he discusses a lot of these developments
it was very substantially his initiative
that
began the with South Africa at first
because Brazil's always had close
you know relations uh Geographic ethnic
and others with South Africa and it
expanded from Brazil and South Africa to
India then Russia wanted in and China
wanted and they became a sort of an
independent law
the United States of course never liked
that very much
and now with the
Takeover in Brazil of the far-right
government the town our government is
unbelievable it's trying to dismantle
every decent thing that was done in the
last years on imposing some legislation
which is almost Unthinkable like a
Constitutional Amendment which bars any
increase in spending for 20 years I mean
which is devastating we know exactly
what that means
so far there's isn't much resistance in
Brazil but I think it'll break out I
don't think they can tolerate them and
what's happened is that the whole South
South effort including bricks has
significantly declined
largely because of the loss of Brazilian
initiative
and this is also true of the
institutions that the independent
institutions have developed in South
America Laguna
and the most interesting one was select
which includes every country of the
Western Hemisphere except the United
States and Canada which is quite
striking but at the moment it's on hold
uh depends what happens in the rest of
the hemisphere
Russia of course going its own way China
meanwhile just sails Along on their own
slow independent policy of trying to
create you know recreate the old Middle
Kingdom basically
there were two recent challenges to
neoliberalism
two research challenges to neoliberal
policies one increase the other one in
Turkey
in my view the other one what increase
the series the other one in Turkey
in Turkey
turkeys and
first of all I like this and what kind
of lessons we could draw from this well
turkey is a little bit different I think
the I don't think the Kurdish movement
was uh and within turkey there's Kurds
all over the place but the most of the
Kurds are in southeast turkey
and I've been pretty much closely
involved with them since the 90s I've
been there a number of times and so on I
think they're just
seeking
basically cultural autonomy
and Independence within turkey they were
bitterly brutally treated in the 1990s
there's one of the main atrocities of
the 1990s which is almost unknown here
for a very simple reason the United
States was providing almost the total
Sport worth Clinton was providing 80
percent of the arms for the horrible
atrocities that were going on the New
York Times of course had a bureau in
Ankara which wouldn't report it
thousands of towns and Villages were
destroyed
maybe 50 000 people killed
hundreds of thousands maybe Millions
driven out it was a real awful time you
couldn't the children couldn't wear
Kurdish collars she couldn't talk to her
there's nothing and in the early part of
this Millennium there was a reversal
uh and things did start getting better
and started improving and uh oh Geelong
you know the official leader actually
changed official policy and said they
only they don't want independence they
want some kind of autonomy or
recognition they weren't even recognized
to be courage you couldn't be recognized
to be a court if you were a mountain
Turf you know and I think this has now
reversed uh erdogan is carrying out a
brutal assault against Southeast
turkey and the Kurds it was again going
back almost to the 90s but I don't think
anything to do with neoliberalism I
think it has to do with turkey's special
effort especially under erdogan to
create a real kind of neo-fascist state
xenophobic
islamist
Gathering Power in his own hands he's
he's sold thousands and tens of
thousands of people of public servants
closed down universities and the Kurds
are suffering most harshly on the other
hand there is a Kurdish reaction not so
much to neoliberalism as to the kind of
General repression and that's in Syria
Republic and the Turks are very much
opposed to that of course but that's a
separate thing in Greece as I said there
were efforts by the series of government
to try to follow the to try to extricate
Greece from the destructive effects of
the programs instituted mainly by the
German banks to try to get back the
payment for the bad loans they made
which sort of amounted to the priests
being the punching bag on the way and
when they tried they were
they were as a recess pretty much gave
up and has lost much most of its
credibility with inquiries whether they
could have done anything else you could
debate
I mean one of the tragedies was that the
series of government was not supported
by the other
kind of progressive movements in Europe
of course the United States so they were
left alone kind of dangling on the line
and they're
couldn't do much
so last question okay
um
how is the privatization of public
colleges and universities affected the
development of a popular alternative to
New York
in the united states in the United
States well as you know
Public Funding for universities has
sharply declined State funding for the
state universities going way down uh
tuitions have gone way up uh
I don't think you can find any economic
reason for this
if you take a look at around the world
the the most successful State capitalist
economy in the world is Germany
education is free
the country that often ranks at the top
for close to the top on all
International
Studies is Finland the education's free
go right south of border Mexico poor
country uh Unum National universities
quite high quality I mean salaries are
horrendous but they have to have a
couple of jobs if you want to teach but
uh
educational research level is quite
impressive it's free now take the United
States
I'm in in the 1950s the United States is
a much poorer country than it is today
far poor education was basically free
the GI Bill offered not only for
education but even subsidy to huge
numbers of people of course it was
racially based you had to be white uh to
get a an education which they never
would have been able to get themselves
it was very good for them was very good
for the country it's part of the reason
for the success of those years in fact
even private universities were very
inexpensive in 1945 when I went to
college I went to the University of
Pennsylvania
the ivy league university
tuition was a hundred dollars a year
and you could easily get a scholarship
you take a look across the board it's
hard to imagine they can possibly be an
economic reason for this you can think
of reasons
non-economic reasons like trapping
students they go back to the early 70s
and take a look at the elite reaction to
the activism in the 60s
really worth reading closely there are
two major Publications came out in the
early 70s the opposite ends of the
spectrum about the terrible time of the
60s it was called the time of troubles
you remember and it was a troubling time
the country was getting a lot more
civilized and that's pretty dangerous
you don't want that to happen and there
was a reaction from both ends of the
spectrum at the right end and these are
if you haven't read them I really are
reading these things at the right end of
the spectrum was the power memorandum
Louis Powell who was a corporate lawyer
who worked for tobacco companies and so
on he Nixon later appointed him to the
Supreme Court he wrote a memorandum
which was secret but it leaked it was to
the Chamber of Commerce and it was you
really have to see the rhetoric the
rhetoric is even more interesting than
the content but the it's the rhetoric is
like a spoiled three-year-old who thinks
he ought to have the whole world and
somebody took a piece of candy from him
so they have a tantrum you know that's
exactly what the rhetoric is like what
he says look the business world is being
destroyed he says the colleges have been
taken over by the far left led by
Herbert marcusa who's organizing the
whole university system the media has
been taken over by the far left
everything's collapsing the business
world is a little embattled sector you
know they're just being beaten down
everywhere and and he says well we got
it he says we don't really have to
accept this because if you look at it
we're the ones who have the funding and
we're the trustees we're the Regents you
know we can fight back and defend
ourselves from this assault actually
it's not just Marcus the other one was
Ralph Nader with the consumer advocacy
campaigns this is just destroying the
entire foreign
a free enterprise system so that's from
the far right and then you go to the
left which is more interesting that's
the study crisis of democracy that came
out from the trilateral commission for a
lateral commissioner liberal
internationalists from Europe the United
States and Japan it's basically the
Carter Administration which was uh
staffed almost entirely from that group
it's that segment and their picture is
the same the rhetoric is different it's
more moderate and civilized and bigger
words and so on but it's basically the
same story it says
the 60s as I said have undermined
democracy that's the crisis of democracy
the crisis of democracy is that most
people are supposed to be passive and
apathetic and let their betters ruin
things but they're getting out in the
streets they're demonstrating women
young people old people Farmers you know
the special interests meaning everybody
and the the American reporter is Samuel
Huntington you know authentic liberal
political scientist and he kind of looks
back with Nostalgia to the Truman years
when he says I'm almost quoting he says
Truman was able to run the country with
the help of a few Wall Street lawyers
and financiers and then democracy was
functioning
but now we've got all these people you
know pressing the government and too
much pressure on the government so we
need more moderation in democracy then
he goes on to the universities the whole
group does Huntington formulates that he
says the problem with there's a problem
with what they call the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young okay this is the Liberals I'm
quoting there are institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young universities the schools you
know the churches and the failing you
can see it from the fact that all these
young people are out there demonstrating
and protesting and raising questions and
so on so we ought to do something to
indoctrinate the young better well
I I don't know if you can throw a direct
connection but the the fact is that
raising tuitions and imposing massive
debt and so on does have the impact of
indoctrinating the young you're trapped
I don't have to tell you for obvious
reasons and I think all of this is just
part of the whole neoliberal policy it's
a collection of ideas that kind of fit
together you know I don't want to say
somebody sat down and spelled it all out
but they're just Naturally Fit together
and I think what's happening in the
universities is part of it
well thank you so much
and thank you
we'll see you the next time we open our
building and in the meantime we have our
event at 7 30 and for those of us who
are part of the group here and we do
have if you want to come and get a
receipt in the front row and get
expressed you don't have to wait in line
Judy fog has these forms for you you can
take them and why don't we uh let
Professor Johnson go out so you can get
back to his results
hmm
yeah
