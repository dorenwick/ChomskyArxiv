now as far as socialism is concerned
that term has been
so evacuated of content over the last
century that it's hard even to use I
mean the Soviet Union for example was
called a socialist society and it was
called that by the two major
propaganda um uh operations in the world
uh the US the Western one and the Soviet
one they both called it socialism for
opposite reasons uh the West called it
socialism in order to defame socialism
by associating it with this miserable
tyranny the Soviet Union called it
socialism in order to gain whatever to
to benefit from the moral appeal that
true socialism had among large parts of
the general world population but this
was about as remote from socialism as
you can imagine and the core notion of
at least traditional socialism is that
what you mentioned that working people
have to be in control of production and
communities have to be in control of
their own lives and so on uh it's uh and
you know this is this
goes uh the Soviet Union was the exact
opposite of that working people had no
control over anything they were uh
virtual slaves uh and the collapse of
the Soviet Union is in fact a small
victory for socialism in my opinion
limit ated one of the major barriers to
it and should have been recognized as
such but the term has
been as I said so become so meaningless
that it's hard even to use if we use it
in the traditional sense which you
brought up uh that goes that you know
that's goes straight back in American
history you read the workingclass press
in u the mid 19th century you know press
uh published by uh U Artisans and what
were called Factory girls young women
from the Farms working in the textile
mills in Eastern Massachusetts which was
Center of beginning of the Industrial
Revolution uh their press was calling
for uh um they said their theme was that
those who uh uh those who work in the
Mills ought to own them uh wage labor
which was called wage slavery uh was
regarded by most Americans is not very
different from slavery uh even the
Republican party uh
regarded wage labor as just a prel at
best a preliminary to free labor but
intolerable because it's a kind of
servitude large part of the uh Northern
population fighting the Civil War was
fighting under that Banner uh this goes
straight through the 20th century the
idea that uh people should be in control
of their own Destinies and lives
including the institutions in which they
work the communities in which they live
and so on call it what name you want but
that's traditional socialism and there
are U there are today attempts to
describe a kind of a detailed vision of
the future uh uh based on these Notions
the most extensive and detailed one I
know is by Michael Albert at znet which
you mentioned it's participatory
economics and there are other such
proposals uh but I think this is deeply
you know deeply ingrained in uh uh
people's understanding and Consciousness
and barely blow the surface in fact it's
a call for essentially extension of
democracy to the industrial sphere and
to communities as well we should also
bear in mind that the deleting uh
American Social philosopher John dwey
who's you know as mainstream as apple
pie uh he uh his and his main work was
concentrated on democracy
uh he pointed out over and over again
that uh uh as long as we have what we he
called industrial
feudalism that is a u a tyrannical
control uh private power controlling
production Commerce uh democracy will be
very limited it has to we have to move
to what you called industrial democracy
if we hope to have significant democracy
as for politics his position was that uh
until that happens uh po politics will
be uh the shadow cast Over Society by
Big Business whatever the and I think
most of the population uh recognizes
that and accepts it
