greetings I'm Ken hilderbrand and we're
here today with Nome Chomsky the world's
most quoted living author yes I always
introduce him that way simply because
he's the most quoted living author but
he's not on these television programs
all these political shows that we have I
never see him on TV I don't watch TV but
I don't hear about him being on and
there's a whole perspective to us and
World politics that's not being heard
right now
I mean gnome has stated that we live
entangled in webs of endless deceit in a
highly indoctrinated Society where
Elementary truths are easily buried not
just mere opinions but
factual concerns are actually hidden
from all of us and what I'd like to do
is stress um well what we talked about
before was elections now we talked about
if nater had run for the presidency well
doesn't I actually ran into Ralph last
week uh I don't think he has much
interest in running and I heard that he
had an article put out today and he
saying that they should get a bunch of
democratic candidates in and they should
debate uh you know amongst themselves
not necessarily to challenge Obama but
just to get the issues out there uh I
disagree I feel that if people are in
this they need to be in it to win I was
in The Healing Arts and I didn't
you know each person came in and they
mattered and as gnome has stated you
know because of this media delusion
these are real people who are suffering
and dying and being tortured and
starving because of policies that we're
involved in so um also last time just
you we talked about if NATO got into the
presidency well well let's say somebody
else uh who has a uh has similar ideals
uh to ours um what I've maintained all
along um that's why I've interviewed uh
presidential uh not only presidential
candidates but also Senate candidates
congressional candidates uh and also
governor candidates but mainly my
emphasis has been on the federal
government I mean Charlie ree uh wrote
an article 545 people and he was
including you know the both houses of
Congress the Judiciary and executive
saying you know these 545 people are
guiding us right now and I just hope
that uh well I'm going to throw this out
to you know that I hope that people uh
will also get involved in the
Congressional races I mean every seat in
Congress is up every two years and I
don't see how we're ever going to
rehabilitate those people who are
corporate puppets and have been you know
funded by Corporate
America so so I don't know if I'd be
that clear but I'll just let you take it
from
there okay okay
yep
so what do you want me to do well I mean
as far as the you know people always ask
what do we do that's what they ask and
I'm saying that the the you know there
are reasonable people who uh are
struggling to get on ballots and often
times they do make it on ballots uh you
know it seems to me that that would be
the Avenue that we should take is to
start supporting these people here you
have a split in in the Republican party
this time around uh with the tea parters
it seems like to me it's the opp you
know we have this opportunity now the
Democratic party needs to split and we
need to have our whole side presented
that's been withheld from the media such
as that we could have peace in the
Middle East that uh you know one of our
top is possession of a plant we can't
stand this kind of inefficiency right
now and there are solutions that aren't
being used because we have corporate
puppets at office so well you mentioned
the Tea Party that's it's not a formal
organization but it is a relatively
coherent uh group and has plenty of
funding plenty of corporate funding uh
and that's why they and besides the
positions they take are uh pretty
congenial
to substantial sectors of corporate
power actually you know CEOs of
Corporations don't like their social
policies but they don't care that much
about them uh what they do like is that
the tea part is a battering ram against
uh uh taxes on the rich against
entitlements for the general public uh
uh against the government spending that
would stimulate the economy so they're
happy to have them around uh the uh you
know the people like us we don't rep we
don't have that relationship to private
power so the comparison doesn't really
mean much uh what can be done is uh what
always works uh slow careful development
of popular
organizations that can put up their own
candidates uh have enough uh
uh broad backing so that just through
individual participation they can
balance off the massive spending that
comes from private power actually unions
were such a force at one time but
they've been so battered that uh and the
reason they're battered is because it's
understood that they're the one
organized barrier to essentially
corporate tyranny so of course they're
under constant attack since Reagan
particularly the private sector unions
have been devastated there's now a major
attack on public sector unions they are
a de democratizing force and therefore
they're a problem uh so you have to
dismantle them and what you and I can do
and others is uh protect the forces that
exist develop new ones but we're not
going to be anything like the T party
they not going to be any Coke brothers
who are going to come around and fund us
they actually have criticized the uh and
or rather they've called for tax cuts on
the ultra wealthy the tea party I didn't
know that well yeah
they're because I know that a lot of
these well if you ask them it's kind of
interesting if you take a look at their
individual opinions I mean there are
studies uh you know major you know the
major polls you know CBS and the rest of
them some of them do quite careful
polling in which they don't ask just ask
general questions but they go into
details
they so like and they break they break
down the results into categories so you
take a look at a recent CBS somebody
poll which U uh came out about a month
ago I think where they investigate among
other things the attitudes of people who
identify themselves with the tea party
and the results are quite interesting so
if when you get a general question like
what do you think about government that
get rid of it right uh not in those
words that's yeah yeah on the other hand
when you ask specific questions what do
you think about spending for Education
should be increased how about health
increased and so on they they
express basically Social Democratic
attitudes what are called Left attitudes
in the United States on the other hand
get rid of government
uh there is an interesting breakdowns
when you ask what about welfare they say
spend way too much on welfare you don't
get rid of it uh what about uh help to
uh uh dependent mothers with dependent
children and no support oh yeah we have
to increase funding for them but not for
welfare and these results like these
have been coming along for a long time
for for example commonly uh when people
across the board or ask what do you
think about foreign aid they say it's
way too high we're giving everything
away to undeserving people out there
when you ask what do you think foreign
aid amounts to you know far higher than
what it is what should it be about twice
as high as What It Is Well I heard that
there was a uh there was an agreement in
the early 70s among several
industrialized countries and they all
they would they would hit 007 of their
gross domestic product in terms of Aid
and nobody met it I think maybe some of
the Nordic countries may have
essentially nobody
you wow uh and in fact the aid that's
given you really have to look at it
pretty carefully a lot of it is tied Aid
you know so so it's it's kind of export
promotion right uh this is all over I Me
Take You Egypt but take one of the main
programs food for peace I that's
basically an agricultural subsidy
subsidy for Agri business it whether it
does anyone any good is a serious
question among other things it
undermines independent
farmers and agriculture in third world
because of what it does to prices but uh
it's also used to fund counter
Insurgency because the details of the
way the fund they were counterpart funds
and they were allowed to be used only
for certain things mon counter
Insurgency so you have to and the same
is true with Britain and other countries
you have to look quite carefully at
what's called Aid uh even when if it
gets there it's not of well but the Mak
is a different one people think we ought
to be giving Aid in fact much more than
we do but when they're asked should we
be giving Aid they say no so to get to
identify the positions of people you
have to be pretty careful including the
tea party right now with Egypt I heard
that the a actually was uh
was some kind of deal where they had to
buy arms or some kind of a lot of I
don't remember Egypt but that's commonly
the case and of course arms for us for
us yeah it's very often tie a one way or
another so it's again that's a a gift to
the military industrial complex yeah
mean you know there's very little
altruism among states I wish I had my
chart here showing where where how the
uh how the money is is split up I mean
we have half of it roughly that's going
towards the uh the
military a Aid no no our I'm sorry our
expenditure expenditures yeah and then
you know health education Ware are a
little tidy
bars great bar for military actually
health is high and the reason it's high
is because the Health Care system is so
hopelessly inefficient it's a you know
privatized virtually unregulated system
it's uh this is old this is what I was
uh looking
at well that's discretionary spending
yeah well you know
uh I'd expect Health to be higher than
that but I don't know no that doesn't
sound right well I I don't see oh I see
yeah health is the second
highest well it's not anywhere near
compared to compared to military well
compared to military yeah sure but uh
Health spending is enormous yeah and uh
way higher than it ought to be it's
about twice as high per capita as
other comparable countries and we talked
about that last time I mean if we were a
more efficient system if we had just the
system other countries do we wouldn't
even have a deficit I mean it's kind of
interesting the way you look at the
discussion now like today you know that
Obama speech yesterday it's all about
the problems of cutting Medicare growth
yeah I mean Medicare is very efficient
yeah uh the uh in fact the proposals
that they're he didn't make them
yesterday but they're right in the
background and they'll come up they're
being held back as to be part of some
kind of compromise but one of the
proposals about Medicare Bears directly
on this it's to increase the uh age at
which people could apply for Medicare
from 65 to 67 well couple of remarks and
comments about that for one thing
there's a very striking class bias in it
uh professionals people who work in
offices and so on you know they can keep
working much longer than somebody who's
a construction worker or a steel worker
firefighter or something like that you
true and also they they have a greater
longevity so you're cutting away at the
benefits of working people and
benefiting wealthy professionals if you
raise it but there's another point if
you raise a Medicare uh eligibility from
65 to 67 that means that for those two
years
uh people are going to have to either
foro health care or else get go get
health care from the private sector
which is extremely expensive uh
especially when you're older so
essentially what that proposal is doing
is increasing Health Care spending it's
not cutting it back it's just shifting
it from an efficient system very
efficient system Medicare very low
administrative expenses and so on to a
highly efficient system which is going
it cost the cost the economy and of
course it's very harmful the individuals
but it's being presented as helping to
save Medicare you know just sort of in
some funny way true but that's not the
way to look at it so here too just like
on the you know tea party attitudes you
have to look pretty carefully at what
all this means well people don't
understand is uh with this military
spending that how much that is that it
it's as much as the rest of the world
combined essentially and that we can
instead of cutting and also when Obama
wants to revert the tax structure back
to what it was okay it was
39.6% but it had been
91% for the for the well when Eisenhower
left office in fact at one point it was
94% for the top 1% now we've also talked
about this thinking that that top 1%
needs to be split again into other
subcategories yeah but besides that top
one 10 of 1% that's observing a huge
amount of wealth are not contributing to
the economy if you look at the rhetoric
these days the Republican rhetoric
doesn't refer to rich people it refers
to them as job creators right that's a
nice orwellian term uh these guys who
are managing hedge funds are not job
creators uh but you can't talk about
rich they're job creators it's constant
now it's a must have been a decision by
the you know PR people and the
Republican party we can't talk about
rich people right well the whole thing
um I mean the World Trade Organization
and NAFTA and now Obama's talking about
more trade agreements these things have
just all they've done is uh undermine uh
uh you know standards for workers and
overseas and taking jobs away from us
and uh and the profiter you have to look
I mean these trade you know the trade is
okay nothing wrong with it but depends
how it's designed yeah so if trade is
designed if trade agreements are
designed so that so for example suppose
we're getting some other country in
Colombia to uh accept the US
agricultural products well that's a gift
to highly subsidized corporate Agri
business
and it undermines farmers in Colombia so
you know the idea that some trade theory
that some somebody talks about in the
economic seminar says it works that
doesn't tell anything you have to look
at what's actually happening the and in
fact the trade agreements which are
called free trade agreements are
anything but all kind of protectionist
elements all kind of non-trade elements
and so on uh and again you have to
unpack that so there's
I right now the frustration is high to
me I do try to interact with as many
different people as I can admittedly I
live in a rural area now but it seems to
me that the descent is as high as it was
pre
911 I've never seen anything like it in
my lifetime now this word is now well I
don't even know have to call it descent
but just anger frustration frustration I
mean it even shows up desent would be
the next something organized you know
something let's criticize something but
now it's just kind of like hatred of
everything and you you see it even in
polls people's attitudes are just about
everything is negative Congress for
example the last time I looked approval
of Congress was in single digits and
about 2third of the population wanted
them all thrown
out president low you know candidates
low professions low Banks we hate them
uh right Hate Everything somebody sent
me an email I wasn't able to verify they
said that they
uh for third party support has gone up
like funding like 300% the what third
party funding third party funing yeah so
I mean that that showed a little bit of
promise I would have to look into it uh
further but I mean I think that's where
I mean we need to head somewhere
otherwise there's not hope and without
hope uh what do we have you know well
that's one striking difference between
now and the Great Depression
I'm old enough just about old enough to
remember the Great Depression and U
objectively it was a lot worse than now
but it was much poorer country for one
thing and so a lot of us take for
granted now you just didn't have that
and and my own family and I was kids so
it's mostly my family that I knew they
uh they were mostly unemployed working
people uh but it there was a sense of
hopefulness not like now there was a
sense that we can get together we can do
things there are first of all the unions
were developing they made a big
difference CIO organizing couple of ants
of mine were unemployed seamstresses
they had ILO that offered them things
and uh there was a sense that we can New
Deal programs were they exactly how much
effect they had you could argue but they
certainly had a very substantial
psychological effect things were
happening there were programs underway
that would made sense and there's a
general
feeling of ens aspiration for something
better and now it's hope it's hopeless
and in fact some of it's objective like
take say manufacturing workers after
that's the core of the any healthy
economy still is uh
manufacturing unemployment manufacturing
was way down actually it's pretty much
the same now but there was a sense then
that the jobs are coming back now there
isn't
and it's probably right as long as the
corporate system the financial system is
structured so as to uh be directed
towards finance and offshoring of
production jobs aren't coming back
actually it's kind of interesting
they're beginning to come back for a
very ugly reason take a look at the
business press uh it turns out that the
Southern States you know
Mississippi Alabama they working
conditions are so
awful uh that they're beginning to be
competitive with China and in fact
investors are now you know wages are
still higher than China but uh if you
work in transportation costs and
productivity and so on uh there there
are uh investment firms and others that
are advising advising investors to think
about shifting production to the United
States because we're becoming a third
world country country so therefore we
can compete with China Vietnam Mexico
namely by driving ourselves down even
further that's a and that's considered a
very optimistic Prospect maybe we can
get manufacturing back it's a heck of a
way to get manufacturing back by driving
us ourselves down to a third world level
you know right well I've heard on the
radio coming up that uh with these uh
fires out of hand they could actually uh
the government could hire people to try
to get in there and stop this before it
really happens and it would be cost
effective but again it would be cost
effective around where I live it's a
suburb of Boston every time there's a
big storm like say Hurricane Irene uh
you lose power yeah and the reason is
that the power lines are above Grim well
they talking about fire but this is true
for all the whole infrastructure it's
infrastructure is kind of rotting and
it's it's not at all cost effective I
mean to put the wires underground once
no that's not cost effective no it would
be cost oh in the long run the long run
sure do it once like most countries do
you've done no more power losses uh uh
rail is a joke I mean I couple of months
ago I was in France and uh had to take a
train I was giving talks in southern
France and I took it I had to go back to
the airport so I took a train from aen
to New Station to
Paris uh which is about the distance
from Washington to New York to Boston it
took two hours very comfortable train
sit and read you know
inexpensive do it here it's a that's a
day's travel that's extremely high cost
it may be a cost that Economist don't
measure it's a cost to the individual
it's cost to you that you spend all day
sitting in a train can't do anything but
but uh the idea that uh I mean coming
back from Europe to the United States
Now you kind of get the feel you're
you're going to a third world country uh
look a couple of days ago I had to give
a talk in Western
massachusett uh College in Western
Massachusetts and they sent out a driver
so we're driving out we're on a highway
you know rout two big Highway uh uh all
of a sudden about 20 mil from the place
we were going the road was blocked I
know there was no sign no
detour no directions just the road was
blocked Highway yeah so the guy who was
driving had a GPS and apparently there's
some way of getting detour so he looked
up at detour so we started wandering
around the country and the detour ended
up with a road plucked no signs no
nothing I start wandering around the
country we found some guy in a pickup
drop key directed us some circuitous
rout we finally got there but you know
in modern countries this just doesn't
happen you know well I think that again
what I was what I was saying earlier is
that I I mean the green party candidates
and other simp uh minded independent
candidates have these answers that we're
trying to put out there for the people
and they actually could choose this and
predictably the media will always censor
these people and I think that we have to
get around that maybe the green party I
mean a name has a a big uh impact for
some reason people looked at Green as uh
they they've given it almost like a bad
name uh if you recall in the early 80s
they had the AIDS uh appetite suppressed
candy well you don't hear about that
anymore a name can turn bad I was
wondering you know maybe a party needs
to be developed I was thinking of the
rational party it's tough to argue for
irrationality and that's what uh
we're as humans we're on an irrational
path right that was a very destructive
path take a look at the uh front page of
the New York Times this morning what's
today September 20th big front page
story very euphoric about uh uh the new
prospects for oil development in the
Western
Hemisphere uh Canadian tarand you know
fracking uh Brazilian underwater deep
underwater oil and this is terrific we
can move towards uh gaining more energy
uh Independence of the kind that we had
say through the SE 70s well there's a
slight footnote there which isn't
mentioned about the worst thing we can
do for our grandchildren is find more
oil unless if we want to destroy the
life for you know our grandchildren sure
that's a way to go uh Senator Bob Brown
not not a
that there's a problem about this the
the green party uh senator from Tasmania
Bob Brown said it's Bush versus our
grandchildren and we really haven't
changed policy since then yeah it's very
tricky because the United States is you
know the United States is a very
business run Society a lot more than
others and uh the doctrinal system you
know media propaganda everything else
very much under corporate control I mean
is everywhere but much more here and uh
so the the idea that we're the idea that
we are that by maximizing the use of oil
we're
undermining the possibility of a decent
life for our grandchildren that's just
not in Consciousness I mean it is for
some people you know but uh nowhere near
General and in fact internationally
speaking the US is you know just
dragging the world down on this it's got
the worst record we're not doing we're
not only not doing anything uh Congress
is busy
dismantling what was instituted by the
last liberal president namely Richard
Dixon Nixon's EPA Environmental
Protection Agency other Regulatory
Agencies that's now being dismantled so
we're we're going backwards it's kind of
interesting if you take a look at the
poorest country in South America Bolivia
they're in the lead internationally and
trying to do something about the
environment I mean if if there are ever
any future historians looking back at
this there be po I mean the richest most
powerful country in history is in the
lead of destroying the possibility of
decent life for our grandchildren the
poorest country uh is leading the way
and trying to do something about it
isn't that something and here we are at
the height of the information age though
that's I just don't I don't understand
plenty of information but it's not
getting to people well what I'm hoping
is and you said it's got to be
focused what what I've asked people to
do uh is to go and check out the the uh
candidates
platform you that that's a you can look
at at their history too but I mean their
platform look at the platform look at
what they support versus the the
candidates who are put out there now um
you see whenever they put something out
there they don't want they pull like for
instance and and then it metastasized to
the presidential elections last time
around first they uh they took out grel
it was
MSNBC and grel told me that uh at that
time they were owned by General Electric
and he said that he his friend received
an email from somebody from GE saying
that uh he did not qualify by our
criteria excuse me this is an energy
company and they're deciding who we see
holy smokes and then they they also took
Ron Paul out last time and that was Fox
that who did that you know we report you
one saw it and I want to bring that up
too because you uh you came to the
defense of something that that Ron Paul
again you said in this media we're stuck
with concision you could say something
that you know if you could say something
30 seconds the people will not if you
say something they haven't heard before
they here's a reason and he wasn't given
much time that's true I saw that I
didn't see it I read about it yeah well
I actually saw that on YouTube oh you
did yeah was it the way it was described
I mean he had these couple of sentences
about the sources of D1 and they
everybody was appalled and they cut him
off and they cut him off exactly I mean
his point was not only accurate but it's
exactly what is uh explained by Pentagon
review panels
like he's from Neptune and they cut him
off that's concision well you know I
wrote about this in 2000 the Iraqi
embargo and at that time uh the
estimates were well I mean when Leslie
saw I don't know if I'm pronouncing her
name right she uh interviewed is it a
she sure you how much I watch TV
interviewed mine alright and said look
at half a million kids have been killed
and she said well it's it's a high price
to pay but we're willing to pay half
them half a
million I mean of real people now anyway
why would you boo somebody who' say that
well that would be the source of of
their you know or part of the source of
their anger along with the the
Palestinian conflict which were alone
along with Israel against the rest of
the world well actually there's one
newspaper after
911 that to my knowledge only one that
went into this the Wall Street Journal
really Wall Street Journal had a poll
right after 9/11 of uh wealthy Muslims
in in the Middle East you know people
who are deeply embedded in the whole US
economic political project managers of
multinational
corporations you know
lawyers exactly the kind of people who
are they could be they have to be local
Muslims they could be from here they
could go up and back so they're not
people who hate our freedom and they
asked them they asked them a series of
questions and the main ones well what's
be you know what's your attitude to the
United States and why and it's uh very
straight they think the United States is
marvelous but they hate what we do and
there were two things one was the Iraq
sanctions uh they know even if we keep
it from ourselves that they were just
murderers and they murdered the
population they didn't harm Saddam
Hussein in fact they strengthened they
streng him and the population had to
rely on him for survival uh probably one
of the reasons he wasn't overthrown you
know he might have easily going the way
of a whole series of other tyrants that
we support but it was impossible and
there's a lot of
discussion the other was the
Palestinians just what you said so those
among the sort of money Muslims as they
were called the the ones who are
entirely integrated into the US
dominated system that's what angered
them now furthermore if you go plus more
they also objected to the fact that the
US supports tyrants and blocks democracy
in development and opposes democra uh
and uh you know those policies so that's
that's the rich
money population furthermore this goes
back many years there similar results
not polls but National Security Council
studies and others from from the 1950s
say about the same thing well you know
people ought to know this just as people
ought to know uh what opinion is like in
the Arab world it's quite important with
the Arab Spring what do people think
it's not that it's
concealed I mean there are us run polls
by prestigious polling agencies or
reason to trust them that come out with
uh studies of public opinion in the our
world they're barely mentioned the major
one which must have been August 2010 I
guess
uh was released by The Brookings
Institute you know major institution I
could only find one it was it was
discussed in the Christian Science
monitor I haven't didn't see any other
report and what it showed was very
interesting it showed that uh throughout
the region um uh when people are asked
what's the greatest threat that you face
United States and Israel what about Iran
10% uh what do you think about Iran's
nuclear programs they said they should
the majority said they should go on to
develop nuclear weapons to counter the
United States in fact in Egypt that's
80% you know
and Americans should understand this if
they it's kept from us but if they
understood it they would understand
right away why US policy and British and
French and so on must try to prevent
democracy prevent democracy of course be
a lot of rhetoric about how wonderful
democracy is but they can't possibly
support it they not going to support
policies in which uh which would drive
the West out of the
region well I mean in 1953 we overthrew
muhamad M yeah that's when it all
started we've talked about this in the
past and it's been going on ever since
sense oh yeah it's a I mean it it hasn't
been I mean the the Iranians certainly
haven't been the uh the
aggressors
uh fact we had supported a a tyrant for
25 years who was hated by the population
and when he was
overthrown we very quickly turned to
support of Saddam Hussein right at his
invasion of Iran in fact if you look
over the last it's almost 60 years years
there hardly been a moment when we
weren't torturing Iran now we don't like
we're unaware of it but they don't
forget I mean they don't forget for
example that in the
1980s when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran
the US armed and supported him uh and in
fact towards the end of the war it was a
vicious War you know hundreds of
thousands of Iranians were killed people
like Amad n Jad were in the trenches at
that time is searing part of their
memory and they don't forget something
else that we don't talk about uh one of
the events that at toward the end of the
war the United States virtually entered
on the side of Saddam they started
American ships started
flagging oil tankers prevent an Iranian
blockade of oil and it ended up with an
American uh Advanced Destroyer thean s
uh shoot shooting down an Iranian
airliner that's I Wasing in a commercial
air Corridor and killing I think it was
290
people right as it was just it was
coming out of Iran in a commercial air
Corridor the uh there's an article in
naval war proceeding naval war whatever
the naval Journal is I forgot its name
by the commander of the vessel who was
right next to the vent in David Carlson
was his name he had an article in there
he he said people on his ship just
couldn't believe it here's this
commercial
airliner coming right out of in a
commercial in Iranian
airspace commercial air Corridor he said
the this
this I think it's a destroyer some Naval
vessel the V said had very Advanced
Equipment you know EG egyp high
technology stuff they said they watched
it being focused on the airliner and
then shot down with a missile killing
almost 300 people uh Iranians know that
and they also know the reaction the ven
came back to the United States got a
hero's welcome uh medals for the flight
officer who shot it down got special
medals the President George Bush HW Bush
the first one uh laed them he was asked
if it's a problem he said I I will never
apologize for anything that any American
sold call that a terrorist attack well
yeah we' call it worse than that but uh
you know that's in their Consciousness
and then right after
that after that the next thing that this
is now George Bush the next thing that
he did first Bush uh he invited uh Iraqi
nuclear Engineers to come to the United
States for Advanced Training in weapons
production this is right after the end
of the war you think they don't know
that and then immediately after that
Sadam got a black eye so he was a bad
guy after that uh the United States
immediately imposed harsh sanctions on
Iran and so it continues to today this
has been a moment when we haven't had
our you know our jackpot on their
necks they know uh same with other
countries that's why you get attitudes
like that in the Arab world they may not
know the details but they're basically
aware of it you know and it cost money
for us to get Eng engaged in these
operations except of course there's
profiteers well you know the two latest
some of the latest academic studies of
the two ongoing Wars Afghanistan and
Iraq estimate the cost of roughly $4
trillion and uh it's you know not small
you know and that's a small piece of it
we now have one or another kind of
military operation going on in close to
100 countries uh bases trading
operations Special Forces and so on
that's Global you know we have to change
our Focus I hope we can get the
people more people organized and realize
that they need to be a part of this too
we're all writing history right now
unless that's the point I mean support
going back to your point uh supporting a
candidate not going to help unless there
is a substantial popular movement that
can back it up like for example Lyndon
Johnson could pass the Voting Rights Act
but that's because there was a mass
popular movement calling for it
otherwise he wouldn't have done it same
with the New Deal measures uh it's it
doesn't H it's not going to happen by
getting a person in there who you like
has to have backing right it has to have
backing but if the people saw it as real
that's the thing like you said that you
know these are real people are suffering
and dying and being tortured and
starving because of policies that we're
involved in I mean we all collectively
fund this we're not living in Nazi
Germany for the hell that's true you
know we we and it's right here too we
got to make it
real you can't miss it I mean take a
look at you know there was front page
story a couple days ago that the Census
Bureau came out with its latest poverty
statistics I mean
they're way out of line with any
industrial country and the highest
they've been I don't know for long well
it's commonly it's what they say on the
the pundits that as far as the wealthy
they always talk about the percentage of
the tax that they're paying no they see
it's interesting what they say they like
David Brooks this morning he he tells
you about the percentage of the T of
their income that's taxable right but
that's not what they pay uh first of all
they're all kind of loopholes uh for
another thing there're all kind of other
taxes that aren't counted there when you
add it all up it's a practically a flat
tax practically a flat tax and then you
know the other Republican line is well
the wealthy pay the majority of the
taxes yeah big surprise you know if you
barely getting if you're barely getting
by and every penny you get has to be put
to bring food on the table you don't pay
much tax that doesn't mean there's an
unfair tax bur well I mean if you look
at the Earth from a distance and you
look at this I mean how are these people
making their money they're making their
money either off of resources or human
resources what else are they
a lot of it is made down in fact
probably the bulk of it by just minor
Financial manipulations playing games
with speculation which does nothing for
the economy in fact probably harms
itow so like if you can cut off a second
say if Goldman Sachs can figure out a
way to devise a computer program that'll
cut off a fraction of a second and
uh stock manipulations they can make a
ton of money is that any good for the
economy in fact it's probably harmful to
the economy it's kind of interesting
that after the crash the recent
crash almost for the first time I think
a couple of you know well-known
economists Nobel laurates began to ask
the question in public do these
financial institutions actually do
anything there's an article as an issue
of uh the Journal of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences you know
big chis ious organization which has a
couple of a couple of articles in a
recent issue by uh one Noel Laur Robert
solo another well-known Economist benjin
fredman saying that it's kind of curious
the Eon the economics profession hasn't
really asked this question what do they
do for the economy and then it sort of
said well we have to look into it but
kind of back of the envelope
calculations it looks as if they
probably harm
it well and that's you know that's like
40% of corporate profit it's not small
wow well we have our work cut out for us
but I believe that um we can do it if we
just everybody puts forth that effort
thanks no yeah
