I'm not I started by saying that one of
the relations between capitalism and
democracy is
contradiction you can't have capitalist
democracy and the people who really sort
of believe in markets or at least
pretend to understand that so if you
read Milton fredman and other Apostles
of so-called libertarianism they don't
call for democracy they call for what
they call Freedom which is a very in a
very restrictive concept of Freedom it's
not the freedom of
a a working person to control their work
their lives and so on it's their freedom
to submit themselves to control by a
higher authority that's called Freedom
uh but not democracy they don't like
democracy and they're right capitalism
and democracy really are
inconsistent uh actually what's called
libertarianism in the United States is
about as extremely extreme an example of
anti- libertarianism that you can
imagine they're in favor of private
tyranny the worst kind of tyranny
tyranny by unaccountable private
concentrations of wealth when they say
well we don't want government
interference in the market
they mean that they mean maybe they
don't understand it but if you think it
through it's pretty obvious the kind of
interference in the market they want to
block is the kind that would permit
unconstrained tyranny on the part of
totally
unaccountable private tyrannies which is
what corporations are it's worth bearing
in mind how radically opposed this is to
Classical liberalism they like to invoke
say Adam Smith but if you read Adam
Smith he said the
opposite he he's famous for not you know
the claim is that he was opposed to
regulation government regulation
interference in markets it's not true he
was in favor of Regulation as he put it
when it benefits The Working Man he was
against interference when it benefited
the Masters that's traditional Classical
liberalism
this what's called libertarian in the
United States which likes to invoke the
the history that they've concocted is uh
radically opposed to basic class
libertarian principles and uh it's kind
of astonishing to me that a lot of young
people say college students are
attracted by this kind of thing I mean
you can't after all read the classical
texts and so take say Adam Smith I mean
Adam Smith at the time he's the icon you
know of libert he's uh he was considered
to be a dangerous radical at the time
because he was pretty anti- capitalist
this pre sort of pre- capitalist era but
he was opposed to it he condemned what
he called the the vile maxim of the
Masters of mankind all for ourselves and
nothing for anyone
else that's an
Abomination uh that take the phrase
invisible hand everybody
learned that in high school or
college Adam Smith actually did use the
term rarely but take a look at how he
used it in Wealth of Nations his major
work it's used once if you look at the
context it's an argument again against
what is now called neoliberal
globalization and what he argued is this
he was concerned with England of course
he said suppose in England that the
merchants and manufacturers
invested abroad and imported from abroad
he said well that would be profitable
for them would be harmful to the people
of England however they will have enough
of a commitment to their own country to
England what's called a home bias in the
literature they'll have enough of a home
bias so that as if by an invisible hand
they'll keep to the less profitable
actions and in England will be saved
from the ravages of what we call
neoliberal
globalization that's the one use of the
term in Wealth of Nations in his other
major work moral sentiments terms also
used once and the context is this
remember England's basically an
agricultural country then he says
suppose some
landlord accumulates an enormous amount
of land and everybody else has to work
for him he says well that
won't turn out too badly and the reason
is that the landlord will be motivated
by his natural sympathy for other people
so he will make sure that the
necessities of life and the goods
available will be distributed equitably
to the to his the people on his lands
and it'll end up with an equal
relatively equal and just distribution
of wealth as if by an invisible hand and
that's his other use of the term just
compare that with what you're taught in
school or what you read in the
newspapers and it goes across the board
like everybody probably has read uh the
first paragraphs of Wealth of Nations
which talks about how wonderful it is
that the butcher pursues his interests
and the baker pursues his interests
we're all happy so we should be in favor
of division of labor everybody's read
that how many people have read a couple
of hundred pages into Wealth of Nations
where he has a bitter attack on division
of labor for interesting reasons and
reasons that were standard in the
enlightenment environment in which he
lived very different from ours uh he
says if you if he pursued division of
labor people will be directed to actions
in which they'll just repeat the same
mechanical operations over and over
they'll be deskilled okay that's the
goal of management for 100 years deskill
the workforce he says that's what'll
happen if you pursue division of labor
he goes on to say this will turn people
into creatures as stupid and ignorant as
a human being can possibly be and
therefore in any civilized society the
government will have to intervene to
prevent any development like this that's
Adam Smith's view of division of labor
The Next Step here's a research project
take the standard edition scholarly
edition of Wealth of Nations uh produced
by the University of Chicago press
naturally on the
bicentennial with a scholarly apparatus
you know footnotes and everything else
and take a look at the index this a
scholarly index look up division of
labor this this part of the book is not
referenced you can't find it unless you
decide to read 700 Pages then you can
find it but that's his concept of
division of labor and it continues like
this I mean I'm not extoling a lot of
things that are you can harshly
criticize like his advice to the
colonies but nevertheless it's a very
different picture from what's called
libertarianism or capitalism today uh
capitalist democracy would
self-destruct capitalism would
self-destruct and that's why it hasn't
been
instituted uh the Masters understand
that they cannot survive a capitalist
economy l a fair economy you take a look
at the history it's pretty interesting
uh so the United States when it was it
was independent so it could reject the
rules of sound economics and developed
there were other countries that were
poised for industrial revolution and
were given the same advice like Egypt
and India in fact India already was the
commercial industrial center of the
world more so than England Egypt was
poised for an industrial revolution and
it's not impossible that it might have
developed it was a rich agrarian society
it had cotton produced cotton as I say
that's the main product like oil today
and it didn't need slaves it had peasant
uh it had a developmental government
aimed at uh Industrial
Development could have taken off just as
India could have taken off but they were
not free to reject sound economics
because they were ruled by British Force
so they were forced to accept sound
economics and Egypt became Egypt and the
United States became the United States
India went through a Century of De
development till it finally got
independent that's what happens when you
apply leair principles in fact that's
essentially how the third world and the
first world divided you take a look at
the countries that developed they're the
countries who violated the principles
England the United States Germany
France the Lo
Netherlands one country of the South one
country developed Japan the one country
that wasn't colonized and was able to
pursue the same course that the rich
countries developed
uh I mentioned that in in mid 19th
century
1846 Britain was so far ahead of the
rest of the world in Industrial
Development that they did decide that
leair would be possible so they moved to
what's called a free trade uh era
it didn't first of all they imposed
sharp constraints on it they cut off the
EMP India India was not allowed to
others could not invest in India their
main possession and India was not
allowed to develop uh there were other
restrictions but pretty soon uh British
capitalists called the game off uh
because they couldn't compete by the
1920s they couldn't compete with
Japanese production so they literally
closed off the Empire to Japanese
exports that's part of the background
for the Pacific War 19 in the 1940s the
United States did the same with its
smaller Empire Philippines the Dutch did
the same with
Indonesia all the Imperial systems
decided no more free trade we can't
compete so they closed off the Empire
meaning Japan had no markets no
resources and they went to war
uh that's a large part of the background
the United States in
1945 did uh uh move towards Le fair in
fact there was an important conference
the United States was basically running
the world at that point you know for
obvious reasons uh there was a
hemispheric conference called by
Washington February 1945 in Mexico where
the Western Hemisphere was compelled to
adopt an economic Charter for the
Americas which which banned any
interference with Market principles the
goal was you read the state department
reports to oppose the New Nationalism in
Latin America which is based on the idea
that the resource that the people of a
country should benefit from the
country's resources that's evil can't
allow that it's Western and US investors
who have to benefit from their resources
so that was the economic Charter the
americaas imposed on the countes the
hemisphere with one exception here the
United States did not follow those
policies quite the contrary as I
mentioned there was a massive
development of a state e paced economy
with an industrial policy uh the kind
that created the modern Hightech economy
you can see it right across the river
take take a look at MIT right one of the
main centers of this if you looked at
MIT in the 1950s when I got there it was
surrounded by uh electronics based
high-tech firms like Ron and itch you
know huge uh it firms uh you take a look
at MIT today take a look at the
buildings it's nardis fizer and so on
the reason is completely obvious during
the 50s and 60s The Cutting Edge of the
economy was Electronics based so the the
way to get the public to pay for it was
to scream Russians and to get them to
pay higher taxes for the Pentagon and
then the Pentagon would fund uh the
research and development like my own
salary for example I shouldn't complain
too much and uh the uh uh and of course
private So-Cal Private Industry was
around there like vultures to pick up
the uh the products and the research and
just Market it well since 70s The
Cutting Edge of the economy has been
moving towards being biology based so
funding Government funding has shifted
Pentagon funding is declining funding
from the NIH and other so-called health
related government institutions is
increasing and the private corporations
understand that so now nardis you know
gen genetic engineering firms and so on
are hanging around trying to pick up the
research that you're paying for so that
they can Market it and make
profits it's just transparent it's in
front of our eyes and it takes a very
effective uh educ ational system to
prevent people from seeing it it's
virtually transparent that's the way
really existing capitalist democracy
Works let's say a final word about
democracy then I'm afraid I have to
leave uh there's a major attack on
Democracy all the way through but by now
it's reached the
point which is pretty remarkable you
take a look at main one of the main
topics in mainstream political science
you know I'm not talking about radicals
mainstream political science is
comparing public attitudes with public
policy it's a fairly
straightforward see hard work but
straightforward effort we have the
public policy so you can see it there's
extensive polling quite reliable
generally consistent it's results it
gives you a good sense of what public
attitudes are and the results of this
are
published in the major books and
articles give you references if you like
the results are very
straightforward about 70% of the
population the lowest 70% on the income
scale are literally
disenfranchised their opinions have no
effect on policy their elected
representatives don't pay any attention
to them uh that's one of the reasons why
many of them don't bother voting they're
not going to pay attention to them
anyway may not read the technical
literature but you understand it in
other ways uh as you move up the income
scale you begin to get a little more uh
a little more influence on policy when
you get to the top and contrary to the
Occupy Movement it's not 1% it's more
like one tenth of 1% when you get to the
top where the massive concentration of
wealth is they basically set policy
that's it's not democracy that's
plutocracy and that's what we have
accepted the good thing about it is it's
changeable it's not controlled by
force we are very free in that respect
thanks to victories over the
centuries that it's not possible now for
a corporation to do what Andrew Carnegie
the great pacifist did in
1890 uh that gives a lot of options and
you have to make use of
them afraid I got to
[Applause]
leave thank
[Applause]
you thank you
