at the beginning of the film Michelle
you you mentioned manufacturing consent
N I wonder if you could talk a little
bit about working with Peter and that
film um which must have started in the
1980s really and then came out in
1992 well actually I can't really claim
to have worked with I spent a lot of
time with him and enjoyed talking to him
very imaginative thoughtful dedicated
person who spent really spent his life
not only then but for many years
afterwards
doing very admirable work of all kinds
often turned out in documentary films
but on serious issues which were hard to
investigate he was did a lot of
courageous imaginative work as far as
that film is concerned I had about as
much to do with it as uh the moon has if
people take photographs of the Moon you
know I I was giving talks and giving
interviews and Peter and uh Mark abar
was I don't know what you call him
technically producer or something was uh
they'd come around and film and we have
some interviews and they put it together
and uh I have to admit I never saw it I
can't stand watching myself so I never
saw the film but I'm told it was a
pretty impressive film they did a very
good job
