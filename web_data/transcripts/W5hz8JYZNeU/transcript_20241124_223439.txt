of today's event today we celebrate the
Legacy and life's work of historian
activist and playright Howard Zin an
historian who made
history he his grandmark 19 publication
of people's History of the United States
Howard Zin gave us a radically new way
to tell and to interpret American
history reacting against conventional
historical narratives which have always
given the impression of a gloriously and
coherently unfolding series of triumphs
and progress Zin privileged the
perspectives of people at society's
margins to use his characteristically
provocative words the slaughtered and
the mutilated Zen's retelling took aim
at the heroes of high school his history
textbooks defiantly forcing us to
confront the genocide of Christopher
Columbus and the Deep racial failings of
Abraham Lincoln zin's Vision had Mass
Appeal for the American public and he
played a pivotal role in our nation's
most important Grassroots struggles for
social justice since the 1960s most
notably around the Vietnam War and the
Civil Rights Movement few are better
qualified to reflect on Howard's in's
relevance to social justice in today's
world than our two distinguished guests
both were close personal friends of
Howard Zin Professor no Chomsky is an
author philosopher and activist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology he
is Institute professor emeritus in the
department of linguistics and philosophy
Beyond his revolutionary work in
linguistics Professor Chomsky is
internationally recognized as a vocal
critic of US foreign policy the
neoliberal turn of global capitalism and
mainstream corporate media we are also
joined by Anthony arnov writer editor
and filmmaker Anthony Arnold

including writing and producing the
people speak a documentary film based on
zin's people's history and screened on
this campus just a few days ago arnov
has also collaborated with Professor
Chomsky editing the 2008 volume the
essential Chomsky our plan for today is
as follows during our first hour our
speakers will each give presentations
during the second hour they will respond
to questions posted on this event's
Facebook page and submitted by you uh by
the the audience today so we'll have
questions from Facebook and questions
submitted by you the audience today if
you haven't seen them already keep an
eye out for note cards being passed
around if you are inspired write down a
question at the end of the presentations
we'll collect them all and cover as many
of them as we can uh we ask that you be
concise respectful and legible uh those
of you in the Overflow uh areas and we
understand there are several overflow
areas um can also submit questions don't
be shy so without further Ado um please
welcome our first Speaker Anthony
[Applause]
[Music]
arnno thank you so much for that
introduction and for all of you for
coming out to honor Howard it's so
beautiful to see the outpouring of
interest and excitement and enthusiasm
around Howard's work not just here today
in new Cults but really at occupy
encampments and struggles and activities
around the country I was so moving to
here that at Boston occupy people were
calling the library there the Howard's Z
Memorial Library the luner series there
was named up power
[Applause]
and of course it's bittersweet uh to be
in this moment of such exciting
possibility and upturn in struggle of
people coming into motion of people
protesting of people organizing because
Howard would have so loved to have been
uh among the people taking part in all
of these demonstrations and activities
it would have been so inspired by the
creativity by the dynamism by the energy
and it's uh it's really Bittersweet to
think about the fact that he can't be
here but he is yeah at the same time so
present uh so present in the way in
which people have honored him like
they've done um the Occupy
Boston uh present through his ideas so
many of the people's libraries around
the countries report that their best uh
borrowed or most often stolen actually
title
the people's History of the United
States you see people with slogans on
their on their banners their handwritten
slogans uh quoting Howard taking uh
quotes um from his books taking quotes
as well from our film that people speak
and um there's nothing automatic about
that there have been moments in history
when people have gone into uh activity
have gone into struggle and haven't
necessarily had the same reverence for
or understanding of the work of those
who came before them and the same kind
of respect uh and uh having drawn necess
the same kind of inspiration so to see
Howard inspiring people to see Howard
finding new audiences today is really
remarkable I mean it's phenomenal that
Howard had the impact he had within his
own lifetime even more phenomenal to see
the impact he continues to have on new
generations of people so I wanted to
share a few stories um of the very lucky
period I had of collaborating of Howard
um just a few that illustrate some of
his remarkable uh character uh as a
person and um and really what made him
such an inspiring example today the the
first story I want to tell comes from my
first conversation with with Howard uh
of course I knew Howard's work I had
read people's History of the United
States seen lectures um had read other
of his books and uh had uh in fact in
some cases traveled hours to hear him
speak at campuses like this uh but we
had never met and then one day I was
working at a small independent
Publishing House in Boston called South
press and I happen to pick up the phone
and Howard's very distinctive voice was
on the other end of the line and this
was um you know a little bit unexpected
uh of course I recognized Howard's voice
but I wasn't expecting him to be calling
South and press that day and the reason
for his call was that someone who he had
corresponded with in prison and visited
in prison for more than a decade was
being released and Howard was calling
around to find work for this friend of
his who he had visited and supported
through all those years incarceration
and that's exactly the kind of radical
Howard was he always put into practice
his ideas his ideals um and he was
always very concrete and committed uh to
the people who he saw himself in
solidarity with struggling on along side
of a few years later uh I had the
privilege of working with Howard to do
book of interviews um called terrorism
and War and they were interviewed
uh that dealt largely with the US uh
efforts at that point uh abroad uh in
Afghanistan particularly in Iraq the
beginning of those occupations and
Howard's clear principal early
opposition uh to those occupations and
during that time Howard called me and um
he was very excited because the night
before he had been invited by Eddie
better Pearl Jam to come on stage at a
concert uh at the Boston um they changed
the name of it but someone here I'm sure
can remind me the name of the
big Fleet CER Fleet Center exactly and
um Eddie better had uh invited him
Howard on stage Eddie having been so
inspired by by Howard's work and wanting
to give Howard a platform and and
introduce Howard to the many fans Who
come out to hear Pearl Jam that night
but also wanting to give Howard a
platform and Howard said to me the next
morning I gave the best speech of my
life it was only three words long and
the war and that really was so poignant
because Howard never made anything
complicated that was simple he spoke
with such concision such
Clarity um and uh and uh and I think
that's part of why he was able to reach
so many distinct audiences with a very
radical understanding of history and of
our role in making history so it's
partly through that influence through
his connection to people like Eddie
better through of course his connection
to Matt Damon who put the brilliant line
in Goodwill Hunting in which Matt
Damon's character and Rod Williams
character talk about two books of
people's History of the United States
and also
manufacturing consent
um that very pointy moment in that film
and then of course there were other
moments uh in popular culture The
Simpsons included a drawing of the
people's History of the United States
later on The Sopranos who have an
episode that opens with a shot of
people's history United States and have
a whole episode constructed around the
conflict around Columbus but partly
through that ways in that way in which
Howards ideas enter popular culture that
this interesting Milestone happened uh
when I was working with Howard on on
that book Terror of war and beginning to
work on another book that came to be
known as voices of The People's History
of the United States and the Milestone
was that a people's history sold its 1
millionth copy which was remarkable uh
uh at the time this is in
2002 at the time it's now sold more than
2 million copies
uh and you know this is a book that was
published in 1980 not the moment of uh
of left or uh uh change in our culture
in fact a very in hospitable moment it
was published in a first edition of
5,000 copies wow um and so to have to
have now infiltrated uh so many
different aspects of our culture and to
have so many teachers surreptitiously
introducing it into their classrooms
even though of course we know that
they're increasing being required to
teach to test and having less and less
control of their curriculum you they're
finding these creative ways to introduce
Howard text to to their students uh and
to bring it into the classroom even when
it's not officially sanctioned to do so
it uh it achieved this first Milestone
of a million copies and Harper Collins
who was Howard's publisher of that book
and as you might know a corporate
commercial publisher um called Howard
and they said well we're very excited
excited this Milestone happening we want
to do something to commemorate the fact
you've reached a million copies and um
what we've come up with is this idea
we'll have a conference of historians
who will sit around and discuss the
impact of your work and maybe we'll have
people read passages of the people's
History of the United States and Howard
said very quickly I'd rather drink
poison
and he said I have a far better idea
people who read my book say to me over
and over again that was so inspiring or
not my own words and of course as you
would joke as as wonderfully written as
my own words are but the words of the
people they encounter from the history
of descent and protest in the United
States Eugene Deb fny L HR Frederick
Douglas all of the people who are
excluded from our traditional education
uh and our traditional textbooks and who
whose voice comes across so eloquently
in the people's History of the United
States I know that was certainly my
experience growing up going to public
school in Indiana knowing nothing about
Eugene Debs the great socialist and
labor organizer and agitator one of the
most eloquent and important organizers
in our country's history and he had
lived in Indiana grow grown up there ran
for president of the United States five
times from the state of Indiana not once
in my school public school textbook that
I come across the name of Eugene De it
was only when I came to the people
History of the United States and so
Howard understood that and he said we
should get people together and have
people read the words and form the words
of the people themselves that was partly
also Howard's understanding of the
importance of art the importance of the
collective experience of coming together
creative expression and so we organized
in 2003 our very first performance with
Kurt Bonet reading Eugene Debs with
Alice Walker with um Patty Smith
performing people have the power and it
was tremendous experience and it really
confirmed Howard's sense of how
important it was to give voice to these
people in our past who have struggled
for whatever freedoms we've achieved in
this country and uh a couple years after
that we were doing some of these
performances around the country and um
we were at an auditorium in Los Angeles
beautiful Auditorium the Japanese
American cultural and Community Center
and we had a great reading that night
and um a very funny thing happened that
I think gives a little bit of insight
into Howard's personality we um we
narrated these uh evenings of
performances from voices of The People's
History of the United States Howard
would sit at one end of the stage I
would sit at the other and then uh we
just give a little bit of a context a
paragraph or two about each of the
performer performances um that the
audience was going to hear and the uh
sound engineers at the auditorium
didn't realize that uh something was
going on uh that became very apparent
when we listened to the audio recording
of the event afterwards which is that
they were leaving Howard's microphone on
during the readings performances which
was a very sweet thing in the at the end
of the day because you could just hear
Howard's joy and Glee and his visceral
reaction to every one of the
performances that night even though he
was so familiar with those voices he had
heard them before he had read them he
had written about them but there was
something so original so fresh and his
his groans of Glee as people were
performing um these these pieces was
just remarkable and then of course later
on we learned that we had to tell the
engineers ahead of time to make sure
Howard wasn't M when he wasn't when he
wasn't introducing
people and you know the process of
working on those those live performances
the voices of people's history the
United States led us to the process of
working on this film the people speak uh
which I was so privileged to work with
Howard on and we we started the filming
of the people speak in Boston at the
Cutler Majestic Theater Emerson College
over the course of two days and I just
want to share uh two stories from that
um the first was uh a very funny moment
uh we had a break in between a morning
taping session and an afternoon taping
session of these live performances that
we were filming for the documentary and
Howard uh was a great fan of Dunkin
Donuts
famously uh uh addicted to their coffee
and donuts and uh so Howard wanted to
steal away and get a Dunkin Donuts
coffee of course we had coffee backstage
you know he could have just gone to the
green room but he wanted to go out to
Dunkin Donuts and you know we were on a
film set so there's Pas and there's
cameras and sound people and he's miked
and but okay we're going to go to dunin
donuts and so Migo mortson who's in the
film besides he wants to come along with
Howard the Dunkin Donuts so we go to the
Dunkin Donuts it's around the corner
it's a small shop and we walk into um
the shop and then suddenly there's kind
of a nervous flurry of activity and this
woman gets out her camera phone and she
wants to have her photo taken but she
doesn't want to have her photo taken
with vgo she she says to vgo
excuse me sir can you
[Applause]
phot and that that was a world as it
should be where it's not we starts with
historians who are who we admire and
respect and of course dieo shared that
sentiment completely and later that that
weekend we had a press
conference in vgo Marson was there and
some other people were in the cast and
Howard said something that I'll never
forget he was talking about the
experience of working on this project
and he said I haven't had a feeling like
this since I was part of the civil
rights movement that feeling of
solidarity that feeling of being part of
something that feeling of being part of
something far more meaningful than your
own individual uh career or
satisfaction and to have been part of
giving Howard a bit of a of that sense
was so exciting and important for all of
us um because really Howard conveyed as
no other person I know the joy of being
an activist that there's no better life
no more fulfilling life than one lived
in
struggle Howard wrote a piece that
um
uh was about Eugene devs and after
Howard died we had a memorial in Los
Angeles for some of the people who had
been involved in the people speak and in
voices of people's history gathered for
kind of a private performance where that
night instead of reading from devs and
and truth and and all the people whose
words had been part of the performances
we had done in voices we had a program
of only reading from Howard's speeches
and letters and and his and his books it
was a very moving evening um people were
brought to tears many times but really
the most memorable moment of that
evening came for me when David scon read
from Howard Z talking about Eugene Debs
and I just want to quote something that
that David read that night and these are
Howard's words we're always in need of
radicals who are also
lovable and what he said about Debs is
that we need to learn from him quote a
determination to hold up before a
troubled public those ideas that are
both bold and inviting the more bold the
more inviting
I think really that just says it all
about how bold inviting the clearest
ideas that he held up and the attraction
that those held for so many people and I
want to end really just with another
thing that Howard wrote um that I came
across recently it's from a book called
postwar America it's uh actually a text
book that he wrote um for small
publisher well not small publisher but
publisher that's not well known today uh
in IND
an Indianapolis based publisher and um
at the end of that book he was writing
about social movements of the 1960s and
the
1970s and he had this to say he said in
postwar America it was beginning to be
recognized by a small but growing part
of the population that the special
qualities of control possessed by the
modern liberal system demanded a long
revolutionary process of struggle and
example the process would have to be
long enough intense enough to change the
thinking of people and I think that idea
of struggle and example really sums up
so much of what Howard's life was about
his commitment to struggle the fact that
he himself was an example uh uh to us of
a life lived in struggle and he goes on
to say that his hope is that through
three associations of people engaged
over a long period of difficult
struggles with entrenched power
democracy would come into its own at
last and I think really in this moment
of occupy that vision is something that
is so vital and so urgent that we fight
for today thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
very hey I neglected to ask earlier that
you please turn off your cell phones if
you haven't already um and now it is a
great pleasure uh to invite to the
podium Professor Nome chsky from MIT
please
[Applause]
anony comments reminded me of one of my
favorite evenings was that
power the same platform more times I can
remember but one of the greatest ones
was uh in April
1975 the two of us were giving a to on a
panel about the war in Vietnam R
University and as Howard was talking I
kid ran down the aisle and said the war
is
[Music]
over when he came up from Boston as sure
you know he was thrown out of the
college where he was teaching in Atlanta
because he supported the black students
who sitting in a l counter really
initiated the Civil Rights Movement
that's too much for the administration
came Boston had a Aman career there most
the couldn't give a class at Boston
University without hundreds and hundreds
of students showing out the the
administration there them so much that
they finally threatened that unless he
was kicked out of his Department the
department would not get even a paper
clip so find power reti went greater
thing well whenever uh I think about the
power which is quite often particularly
in the last few months for pretty
obvious reasons there are words that of
his that always resonate in my mind
there his called to focus our attention
on his words the countless small actions
of unknown people that are the
foundation for those great moments that
ultimately enter the historical record
without the countless actions of unknown
people that created them uh that's a
fundamental truth of history and it's
one that his work can affect his life as
well uh to uh
a great deal to illuminate to bring
through our understanding it's no
exaggeration to say that he literally
changed the Consciousness and also the
conscience of entire generation it's a
small achievement and it continues and
expands well this particular event could
not have been better time it's of course
taking place in the midst of countless
small actions of unknown people who are
uh
Rising about the remarkable occupy
movements
[Applause]
[Music]
now not there by now several thousand of
the United States and a couple hundred
countries
elsewhere uh these are uh the first
real uh reaction first real challenge to
the effort to reverse the what has been
a severe assault on the general
population of the United States in the
past
generation counterparts throughout the
world are reacting to quite similar
results of major exercise of bitter
class war that's been worldwide centered
in the United States spread throughout
much of the world and the similarities
of
uh so just take what's maybe one of the
most dramatic the most dramatic up
Square now that's not sua's part of
course but nevertheless the uprisings
share many said in critical features
that have many the same groups in
Egypt Mubarak dictator mubarak's
programs neoliberal programs they follow
up the rules of the F the Washington
consensus established by uh what's
sometimes called the IMF World Bank
treasury tram
or World governance uh and they had the
same devastating effects that they had a
uniform uh they created great deal of
wealth but uh in very small sectors of
the
population they severely
harm much much of the population
inequality
sword uh there was a massive
corruption uh increasingly brutal
repression of workers others who tried
to defend or obtain Elementary rights uh
virtually up to the moment of the Arab
Spring the uh World Bank and the IMF
were issuing glowing reports of the
remarkable achievements of the uh uh
Egypt's economic and political managers
following these principles coming from
Washington uh that's again a routine
practice it's happened over and over uh
up till right before the edifice
collapses as of course it regularly does
and all of that is quite familiar here
uh maybe hard to remember in today but
Alan Greenspan the head of the FED who
was called St
Allen were
today just a few years ago he was being
hailed by professional economists as one
of the greatest economists of all times
he presided over a miraculous
economy called the Great moderation in
which all fundamental problems had been
resolved thanks to the Triumph of the
market the Miracles of economic theory
and also was greenspin proudly explained
to Congress uh thanks to Growing worker
insecurity which reduces pressures for
compensation and decent working
conditions which quite obviously
are worthy features of a healthy society
and a healthy economy and meanwhile very
much as in Egypt wealth concentrated in
the pockets of a fraction of 1% of popul
for the majority real incomes stagnated
off a decline people try to get buy with
increased working hours far beyond other
industrial countries unsustainable debt
and uh asset inflation meaning temporary
paper wealth from the reg bubbles that
all disappear when they collapse it's
been a regular feat economy ever since
the r years when the New Deal regulatory
apparatus was dismantled during the
earlier period 50s and 60s great growth
period no financial crisis but in the'
70s the economy shifted dramatically to
financialization normous growth
financial
institutions and offshoring of
production uh all of this related to
fundamental Chang in the economy among
them the decline in the rate of profit
in manufacturing here which directly
Capital other other in other directions
that's what happens in undemocratic
societies where uh investment and other
decisions are
not
well the basic facts are too familiar
for me to review so I won't do it the
first last few months having me
witnessed the first major popular
reaction to a vicious period of vicious
class War uh that's the occupi movements
New York and very quickly spread and
shortly before them and in part in part
inspiring them the dramatic developments
in Egypt and the rest of the Middle East
of North Africa may not sometimes cool
well not surprisingly right now they're
all facing regression worldwide
partially coordinated
uh it's of different kinds in different
places uh but the general Tendencies are
strikingly similar just as the global
Assault on of the past generation has
been similar many of these aspects well
for Howard I'm sure that the rising up
of countless unknown
people and their many actions all of it
would have been the Fulfillment of the
dream of a lifetime of passionate
commitment and devotion and another
Vindication of lessons that he work very
hard to convey to us to impart to us
about how we can progress towards a more
civilized world have happen there are as
Anthony mentioned there are regular
Howard in memorial events they occupy
movements how in libraries how in
Memorial lecture series
was privileged to give the first one of
those in the occupied Boston movement
but they're all over the place and with
very good reason there is nobody who do
so much to inspire these movements it's
a tragedy for all of us with Howards not
here to invigorate them way he did for
so many years and to help direct them on
a constructive path that's not going to
be easy uh to
tremendous success but the the
tactics have a kind of
halflife for a while but after a while
we to have diminishing returns it's
necessary to think about how to modify
them keep the principles in mind not
being too W to the tactics and go on to
do other things and it's I think
clear what kind of things have to be
done now it's not going to be easy to do
it's also necessary to
deal with the obstacles that are going
to come up and power system of power
don't way the buy cheerfully they have
many means to protect themselves they
have plenty of experience about
protecting themselves uh unlike the
popular movements which keep coming up a
new through historical memory it's
particularly true in a highly atomized
Society like ours where
there aren't there hasn't been sustained
movement whatever you thought about the
old Communist party there was one good
thing about they knew they weren't going
to win quickly there always going to be
somebody around to turn the MRA machine
the next time the demonstration started
Civil we talk about the Civil Rights
Movement we think about the' 60s but it
started in the
30s way back before that it was really
taking off in the
1930s some victory lot the Feats which
keep add it and for fruit in the small
measure because of things that Howard
was doing his support for other and his
participation actually the first time we
spent
any long period of time together there
was added civil rights demonstration in
Jackson Mississippi back in the early
60s they remember or know about what
those things were like
well that's uh Howard did one of the
things he dedicated a lot of his life to
was trying to overcome this a lack of
historical memory and made a lot of
inroads but it's a task that that really
has to be pursued intensively with the
recognition that Victory aren't going to
come fast you may get small reforms
Power Systems can collap and accommodate
and modify but if you want to have
longer term changes you have to be you
have to
expect
substantial hard dedicated commitment
over a long stretch and it can achieve
goals but not easily well there's
another uh striking point of comparison
between the Arab Spring and the
occupying movements here and that's the
aspiration
that kind of inspires all them for
authentic functioning
democracy there are differences in Egypt
say the effort is try to to try to gain
Elementary Democratic rights which have
been blocked by the us back dictatorship
and still are uh in the United States
the effort is try is to try to recover
the rights that had been won over
centuries of struggle and have been
beaten back
uh at least to do that and I say at
least
because uh the victories that had been
attained as a are real were
nevertheless partial and if can recover
the ground that's been lost and that's
not easy inself why you should be able
to go far beyond that well we all know
about the the way in which the
democratic system has been shredded
during the ne liberal period perod one
familiar fact is the
spectacular rise in the cost of
Elections it's obvious consequences it's
estimated to be about $3 billion for the
next week only one place to get 3
billion and that's what's going to be
Cur part of platforms media and the
execution of them uh the US isn't Iran
uh a candidates are vetted by the clergy
before you can vote for them and get a
democratic vote in the United States
they're vetted by concentrations of
private Capital uh and then you get a
vote uh it's a difference
[Music]
atic recently Financial
Capital recent years Financial capital
is
grown small part the economy back in the
1970s right before the8 crash it was
about 40% of corporate profits it's
doubtful that it does anything for the
economy probably harmful but it is
remarkable and power both economic power
and economic power yields political
power almost automatically so that leads
to legislation that accelerates this
vious cycle we've been living in well
there's more to it than that another
aspect not very well known studied
by outstanding political Economist a
close friend of how Thomas Ferguson uh
his study the way power has shifted
within
Congress it used to be the case that if
you wanted a position of influence in
Congress a chair of committee that was
attained by seniority and service
essentially not 100% but that was the
principle that's this disappearing
that's now Fus and Sean it's now
increasingly uh the result of paying
money into the party cers well one way
to
get buys you chair of a committee or
other position of influence that's the
same corporate Pockets that the
candidates are reaching into
to be elected and that uh that a lot of
that that kind of thing is has a lot of
consequences one consequence is this
tragic comedy of the Republican
debates last couple months people can't
believe what's going
on anything like it in history ofli
democracy certain inevitability to it's
not just happening because they are
weird
people a consequence of the fact that
couple of decades ago the Republican
Party abandoned any pretense of being a
conventional political party it's now
just a party of the super
rich term which you're not allowed to
use there's a contemporary fourwh ISM
you're not say wealth you're supposed to
say job
[Music]
Creator percentage of the population
which is sitting on mountains of cash
that's so huge they don't know what to
do with it but they do know what not to
do with it
[Applause]
[Music]
jobs there is
a striking feature of the Republican non
party is that has a definite party line
which makes the old Communist Party a
little
flexible phrases and among them is
J don't say that you're out of the
party so on well
this there that has effect I mean if a
an organization a
political electoral organization is
solely working for the benefit of the
Super Rich has get votes somewhere and
you can't get votes by saying this is
what we do so it's
necessary automatically to appeal to
tendencies in the population which have
always been there attractive Tendencies
they around and in the last couple
decades they've been increasingly
mobilized religious
fundamentalism ofly nativist tendencies
hatred and fear uh these things get
mobilized and you have to appeal to them
get Republican debates get other things
in not so recent history not so ancient
history that are not very attractive old
enough personally
and
knowledge
that's serious matter that shouldn't be
uh overlooked however one definite
principle of the party line is that
those who are super wealthy have to be
protected from the indignity of having
to pay a fraction of
taxes but not dreams of having to pay
the taxes that they did during the Great
growth period 50 60s May partly the
90s meanwhile their share of national
income to tiny fraction of percent has
reach unprecedented height and
corresponded with the share of the
national income working people has
reached the unprecedented
lows the ones who still have jobs well
that's these are things that are
happening right before our Liv now the
other the business we have business
party that monopolizes elections has two
faction
and the other faction who were mostly
what used to be called moderate
Republicans and not called
Democrats all of this
is an indication of the deterioration of
functioning Democratic fors become more
more forms was those sub well one index
of how democracy is functional democracy
how it's actually functioning one index
of that is the relationship between
public policy and public
will in a democracy you learn in 8th
grade uh the public will deter policy
and whatever there Gap the character and
scale of that Gap tells you something
about what's happening in the society
close a gap now it's not a gap anymore
it's a cm
the difference between very heavily P
Society a lot of what people think and
the gap between what people want and
what's talked about in Washington is
astonishing Ian you can see it front
page every day there is a topic that
Washington that's the deficit have the
focus on the deficit well the public has
opinions about that the public doesn't
regard the deficit big problem uh they
regard the big problem as jobs I think
they're right that's maybe a problem
potentially down the road it's not a
serious problem now obvious from the way
Financial Market are function uh but for
the bankers the deficit problem so
that's what you thought about the
deficit well let's keep to the deficit
how you deal with public has opinions
overwhelmingly the public thinks you
should increase taxes on the very Rd
and should protect
benefits any
attack the financial institutions and
the ultra Rich think the
opposite therefore that's the way it's
going to turn down no taxes on the very
rich and cutway benef in fact you've
probably seen the leaks that came out
from the defic commission they indicate
that these Democrats have been moving
towards privatizing Medicare
now if you think that's supposed to cut
the deficit actually increases medical
costs for very simple reason uh the
private sector is far more INF and far
more forly so if people can shift from
Medicare to the private sector private
insurance that increases medical cost
course many of them can't afford to ship
so it doesn't increase cost at least
when you measure them col Le increases
other C what they're doing is pursuing
this is the Liberals are pursuing
policies which are don't increase health
caes but transfer them from taxpayers
which at least partially reaches the
famous job Creator or shifting from them
to the elderly the same is true of of
course there are more extreme proposals
like ran PA's you probably know it's
backed by just every
Republican study bu obviously budget
they estimated will add tens of
trillions of dollars to costs but
transferred over to people can't pay
for the same is true
of people the same is true of raising uh
eligibility ages so you
raisig 65
67 that doesn't much affect people like
most of us uh we tend to live longer but
if you're a blue color worker it it cuts
off a big piece of your life uh
construction worker fire somebody does
hard physical work your life is short
those two years are two years less that
which you can
get
care but also also raises health care
costs of course for the same reason me
course to shift from relatively
efficient Medicare hopelessly efficient
private insurance costs but not
defit radar screen is soci
security this has nothing to do with the
deficit it's discussed part of the
entitl problem but that's just a way to
try to undermine Social Security is self
supporting it's doesn't improve the
deficit and it's in pretty good shape
it's in good shape for Dees in
fact plans farther than that and
tweaking keep it going forever but
social security has real problems uh not
financial problem but one problem is
it's of almost no significance to people
who are relatively well off like I had
Social Security but a big pension
because I worked at I for 55 years so
Social Security is there it's kind
if you're you're a working
person a disabled person something like
Social Security your whole inome
particularly after the collapse of the
asset bubble wealth bubble people had
their Assets in their homes that's gone
among African-Americans for example
wealth is practically down to zero uh
these people survive on social security
so one problem is well it's only works
for the majority of the poor people
doesn't work
for rid the other problem I think is
more
fundamental it's the principle on which
Social Security is based social security
is based on the principle of solidarity
and that's a very dangerous principle
you might care about somebody
else dis town
has food need if you're a proper student
of
grein and so you know that her problem
she married the wrong
person the idea that you should care
about someone else is an extremely
dangerous
uh feature of a society which has to be
driven towards total salry uh
pure Market Capital inside Society uh
and if people have
Notions like sympathy and solidarity are
interferences with these systems so you
got to come away
and very far that you go back to the
early days of the Industrial
Revolution 150 years ago it was a very
Lively VI press at the time much more
than ever since it included a labor
press written by working people in fact
Factory girls from the
farm Irish AR from bos and so on and
they were bitterly from down industrial
system they took it for granted
that those who work in the Mills are own
we don't want managers we don't want
wood free Americans which don't run
ourselves the industrial system was
taken away their intellectual culture
which was quite High out that b long
time I can remember in my childhood the
uh uh but one thing that
they really condemn harshly was what
they called the new spirit of the age
1850 the new spirit of the age in 1850
is gain wealth for getting old s and
that
as it's
over a Century Century and a half to try
to drive CL like that out of heads and
some steps towards it uh but the Social
Security is one of the things to stand
way I said we don't care only about self
we care about other people I think the
attack on public schools has essentially
the same R like why should I pay for the
schools in the
town school but
somehow Force those Concepts into
people's heads there been a battle for
150 years and prob a
battle
pred undiscussed going back to the
deficit something that's completely
undiscussable namely that there's an
easy way out of the deficit everybody
cares about Def and it's not at all
Utopia and simply shift to a Health Care
system of the kind that every other
industrial society has
[Applause]
very popular
[Music]
idea when Obama gave away the public
option without a try that was over the
objections of a large majority of the
population when he made an arrangement
with big Farm the pharmacetical
corporation to persist in this kind of
outlandish concept unique to the United
States that the government's not allowed
to negotiate drug prices about 85% of
the population opposed it but these
things you can't and in fact it is true
that if we had a health system with the
costs of other industrial countries
which were better than ours mostly if we
had that we wouldn't have a
deficit but that's
undiscussable uh it's not part of debate
it infringes on the rights of insurance
companies corporations so if the Press
mentions it which it rarely does it says
it lacks political support or it is
politically impossible or something like
that which is correct in a system which
doesn't intended the function of
democracy well that's far from the only
case of the chasm between public opinion
public cost
but it's
worth talk about something else it's
very important to recognize that there
are other ways to undermine uh
Democratic institutions that Beyond
suppressing and ignoring uh public
opinion which is dangerous way it may
lead to reaction a better way is just to
control op and that's often more
effective than some example right before
our eyes today
uh I'll pick one that's of extraordinary
significance because it's maybe the most
serious issue in human history it has to
do with whether the species believe in
survive so let me just review a couple
of events of the past few weeks which
should have had screaming headlines in
any Democratic Society
mention one of themed
start with November
28th a week November 28th the
international dur convention on climate
change over has a task its task is to
try to carry forward the very limited
earlier
decision partially implemented that's
the UN framework Convention of 1992 on
the climate the Koto protocol of
1997 sign his first commitment period is
ending and that's supposed to come up
there's a general move here was captured
pretty effectively by the New York Times
headline ENT issues low
expectations uh the same time as the
conference with the international
po uh by the Le polling agencies quote
some of the results public around the
world and even in the United States say
their government should give global
warming a higher priority and strongly
support multilateral action to address
it also in the United States I said but
much less than elsewhere uh us concern
about the threat has been declining over
the last few years so that American
concern is significantly lower than the
global
average to quote Americans do not
perceive that there is a s ific
consensus on the need for Urgent action
on climate change a large majority think
that they're not being affected and
that's contrary to views in most other
countries but Americans tend to
underestimate the level of concern among
other Americans but none of this is
accidental and it's directly related to
the deine of democracy resulting from uh
dedicated efforts to control
pinion uh again with the successes of
the
insurance insurance industry and big
Pharma to undermine any kind of moderate
Health Care reform and the other
industries were inspired by that they
quite openly the energy intensive
Industries announced openly that
inspired by that they were going to
carry out huge propaganda campaigns by
the major business lobes chamber Comm
try to cast doubt on the near unanimous
consensus of scientists on the threats
of glob warming sever threat I noticed
it's only
near and because there are two groups
that don't agree one of them is a very
marginal group of climate change deniers
there is a grp that on any Topic in the
physical sciences find some
people so there's a small group the of
deniers but there's another group very
large group of people who don't agree
with the consensus because they think is
much too optimistic well they're out of
the discussion the
standard media presentation is kind of
he says she says on the one hand you 98%
of scientists on the other hand pring of
deniers omitted entirely for thee a very
substantial number of
climate scientists who say that it's
just
it's it's not this much true optimistic
and they're probably right I'll come
back to that in a minute but this is
tremendous all of these developments in
the United States are quite a remarkable
achievement of advertising propaganda in
a highly controlled democracy and in
this case what's state is where a
grandchild world live
well the world is well aware that the
United States government was dragging
its feet on this issue so the same polls
say that publics around the world have
in recent years have largely disapproved
of how the United States is hand the
problem of climate change in general the
United States has been most widely seen
as the country having the most negative
effect on the world's
environment by China Germany receiv the
best one way to gain some perspective on
what's going on in the world is is to
imagine yourself in the position of an
intelligent extraterrestrial
Observer on Earth right now Ober just be
watching and wonder as the richest most
powerful country in history is
cheerfully leading the ls over the cliff
that's exactly what's happened uh the
International Energy agency no radical
output was initiated on Henry Ker's
initiative it comes out with regular
reports on carbon emissions couple of
weeks ago it came out with later report
said they're rapidly increasing if it
continues on its present course by
2017 5 years the carbon budget will be
exhausted carbon budget is is the
quantity of emissions that can keep
global warming below 2° Centra rise
which is generally considered the limit
of survival safety 5 years away the Ia
Chief Economist said the door is closing
if we don't change direction now on how
we use energy we will end up beyond what
scientists tell us as the minimum for
likely survival the door will be closed
forever 5 years a couple of days before
that the US Department of energy
reported emissions figures for
2010 uh that jumped by the biggest
amount on record the level of greenhouse
gases they reported is now higher than
the worst case scenario that was
anticipated by the uh ipcc main
International Confederation of scientist
just 2007 Now worse than the worst case
scenario the MIT has a major program on
climate change it's co-director John
Riley I pointed out that the scientists
have generally found the ICC predictions
to be too conservative unlike theor
friend Deni G public attention and he
pointed out that the ipcc's worst case
scenarios were in the middle of the
estimates of the like areos by the MIT
clate specialist and not unusual well
just as these predictions were being
released within days the London
Financial Times devoted a full page to
very optimistic expectations that the
United States might become energy
independent for a century with new
technology for extracting fossil
fuel the US might Le frog Saudi Arabia
and Russia to become the world's leing
producer with the H of G oil and natural
gas and in this delightful event the us
could expect to retain its Global homy
for Century there are a couple of
remarks scatter there about local local
ecological impact what M hting War
supplies nothing has said about what
kind of a world will emerge from these
exciting prit that's pretty important
the financial times as you may know is
not only the world's leading Business
Daily but it's one of the most sensible
journals in the world this is not the
editorial page of the Wall Street
Journal expect things like that a
serious journal and they can break this
in the middle of all these expectations
coming
out get publicity but certainly know and
no
that's dangerous well just about every
government in the world is taking at
least haling steps to do something about
it and the US is inde leading the pack
but
backward part of the catechism of the
Republican candidates along with the job
Creator and so on one of them is that
there is
no global
warming real drill that's have to keep
for that if you want to be part of the
game and the Republicans in the house
are now dismantling the measures which
were introduced by the
last if
remember did introduce some of
control
me things they're being
dismantled that's another indication of
a very severe crisis of American
democracy it's a crisis for the whole
world
for grandchild well as I mentioned the
gap between public opinion and public
policy in this case is is not as great
as it ought be uh and that's the most
serious issue on the international
agenda history because of control of
public opinion if you happen to read
this morning's newspaper you'll notice
that there was another report on by grp
of scientists
carbon emission which reiterate
conclusions of the US Department of
energy uh six weeks ago which barely
were
mentioned well going back to that
extraterrestrial
Observer pardon if they would conclude
that we seem to be infected by some kind
of almost Leal insanity and it's it's
institutional it's not individual make a
lot more significant
unfortunately it's not everyone I
haven't seen a pole in the Occupy
Movement but I I'm confident that if
there was
one
this and there are some VI smallies for
real so the XO pipeline has at Le
delayed not for wonderful reasons
necessarily with the help of property
owners who the want backyard
Victory
not activism made made made a difference
demonstrations in Washington people
arrested wrong
bases and one of the major tasks of the
occupying is going to be I'm not L to
try to reach out to the general public
counter corate
propaganda that is in this particular
case
exactly the opposite of the internet of
the scientific consensus for example the
Artic financial times that I mention a
lot like well that
generalizes challenges ahead
are very serious blood range once again
they going to require solid lasting
organization one of the real
achievements of the Occupy movements
exciting achievements is that they have
created did a lot of bonds and
associations among the participants it's
very significant in atomized society
that just no tradition of working
together people G
experienceing communi
work sustaining and if that can be
carried forward and translated into
something broader it could be Real
historic significant and once again the
countless small action to Unk people it
could become the foundation of Great
Moments that will enter the historical
record of vindicating again
