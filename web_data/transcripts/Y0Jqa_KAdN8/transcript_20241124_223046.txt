you mentioned china
so many of us assume that the biden
administration will reduce the bellicose
attitude displayed during the trump
years that does not seem to be the case
what in your view explains the american
shift in seeing china as a somewhat of a
partner in corporate-led globalization
from the 1980s onwards to viewing it as
a grave threat today
you're quite right the
biden administration
selected a very hawkish group of
national security advisers
who are raising
tensions with china carrying out
provocative acts
all
presented in the united states says an
effort to counter the china threat
raises a question
what exactly is the china threat
lots you can condemn in china
their behavior in xinjiang province uh
fortification of islands and
south china sea and violation of
international orders
lots you can condemn
is it a threat to the united states
the so-called threats are all either in
china
or on the borders of china
actually this question was
is raised
not in the united states much but in
australia
right in the
clause of the dragon
the
distinguished statesman former prime
minister
paul keating
recently
wrote
in the australian press about
what is the china threat
he went through the various arguments
showed quite easily that they
are built on sand
and he concluded that the china threat
is that china exists
i think that's correct
china exists
it is not subordinate to the united
states
it cannot be intimidated by the united
states it's not like europe
and that's unacceptable
if you're the
global
dominant hegemon
the mafia don basically
you can't accept
successful defiance
we have many examples of that
so take the most
obvious and dramatic of them
for 60 years
the united states has been
torturing cuba
major terrorist wars sponsored by the
kennedy administration
uh
one of the things that led to the
missile crisis
uh
an embargo so severe that it's in fact a
blockade
constant torture of cuba
because of the cuban threat
what exactly is the cuban threat
well one good thing about the united
states very good is it's a
quite an open society much more than
others
so we have access
substantial access
to internal government documents
uh from the
1960s
and they the state department explains
the cuba threat
it's i'm quoting it now
castro's successful defiance
successful defiance
of u.s policies
going back to the 1820s
1823
the monroe doctrine
when the u.s government established its
goal
of dominating the hemisphere
couldn't carry it out at the time
britain was much too powerful
but that was the intent
the united states should dominate the
hemisphere
castro is carrying out successful
defiance of this principle
and that's intolerable
well on a much larger scale
china is carrying out successful
defiance of the u.s
policies since world war ii
of attempting to rule the world
and
china is not europe
when
the united states imposes
sanctions on
iran let's say
europe doesn't like it they're opposed
to it but they obey
when the u.s imposes
a blockade of cuba europe's opposed
votes against the united nations but it
obeys
they
are live in fear of the godfather
they don't step on his toes when the
united states gives orders
europe obeys
most of the rest of the world does too
china doesn't
not only that but it can't be
intimidated
well
as paul keating said
that's unacceptable
that's the trainer threat
it's not
again
there's plenty conden to condemn in
china's behavior
but to try to find the threat i think
paul keating is correct
