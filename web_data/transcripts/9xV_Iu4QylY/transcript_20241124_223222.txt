you make a point in the book that the
claim that governments are primarily
concerned with security begs the
question of security for whom and how
security is defined I wonder if you
could elaborate on that point well the
academic professions and studying
international relations and so on that
do take for granted that uh the main
role of governments is to provide is to
protect uh the national interest what's
called the national interest which means
basically security but they rarely ask
security for whom so the first question
that comes to mind is is it security for
the population and actually I go through
a lot of the record there in the United
States same elsewhere and it's you can
show pretty clearly uh and very
persuasively that security of the
population is a very minor concern and
it's often saf
dramatically uh for other interests so
security for whom well there are two
answers first of all for state power
states to try to protect themselves and
they want to protect themselves against
their enemies and one enemy is the
domestic
population the NSA surveillance system
is Snowden exposed as one example but
there's plenty of others the domestic
population is almost always considered a
real or potential enemies you got to
control them so we need security of
state power for them but state power
doesn't exist in a vacuum that's one of
the weaknesses of international
relations Theory it depends on the
internal distribution of power within
the domestic society and there's no
secret about where that is plenty of
academic and other research and sort of
Common Sense simply tells you the
obvious
it resides overwhelmingly in
concentrations of economic power in the
the corpor the corporate system extreme
wealth financial sector and so on that's
where policy is overwhelmingly
determined there are interesting
exceptions but it's overwhelmingly true
so their security has to be guaranteed
take say the transpacific trade
agreement just
under discussion right now whose
security is it defending not the
population that's harmful to populations
but very good for the pharmaceutical
corporations it's called a Free Trade
Agreement in the Press but it's a highly
protectionist agreement which has uh
which offers U protects the uh
exorbitant profits of the pharmaceutical
media and other maor major conglomerates
with the kind
of patent protection measures which
never existed in the past just like the
World Trade Organization NAFTA and so on
their security has to be protected a
crucial part of the TPP like NAFTA and
others is that corporations have an
astonishing right they're granted the
right to sue governments which you and I
can't do but they can they can sue
governments if governments undertake
policies which they claim harm their
future
profits so if say uh Mexico sets up a an
area for maybe Environmental Protection
whatever some us company can and in fact
does it's not invented so them because
it's taking away the potential profits
of a US Corp corporation which might
want to build a gold mine there or
something uh I mean this
is the fact that these are called free
trade treaties is ludicrous but for that
matter they're not even trade treaties
these are investor rights agreements
designed to protect the security of
those who have an overwhelming role in
formulating state policy namely the
corporate sector not a 100% but
overwhelming uh so that's the two forms
of security that have to be guaranteed
are state power private power closely
interlined the welfare of populations is
incidental
