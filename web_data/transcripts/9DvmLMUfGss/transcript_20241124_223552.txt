uh Professor Noam
chsky is listed in anybody's cataloges
among the half dozen top heroes of the
new left this standing he achieved by
adopting over the past two or three
years a series of adamant positions
projecting at least American foreign
policy at most America
itself his essays and speeches are
collected in his new book American power
and the new
mandarins uh usually Mr chsky writes
non-political books for instance
syntactic structures in
1957 a cartisian
Linguistics in
1966 and topics in the theory of
generative grammar
1965 he is a highly esteemed student of
modern language anguage and Linguistics
who teaches nowadays at the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and has taught before it
Berkeley Columbia and other strif torn
universities he is a member of many
organizations and learnning societies
including I'm sure he would want me to
mention the Aristotelian Society of
Great Britain in one of his essays Mr
chsky writes quote by accepting the
presumption of legitimacy of debate on
certain issues such as this one
one has already lost one's
Humanity I should like to begin by
asking him why under the
circumstances if by being here he stands
to lose his Humanity he consented to
appear in the first
place because first of all I I didn't
quite put it in those terms I don't
think I think that by yeah but I think
that there I said that there are certain
issues for example aitz such that by
consenting to discuss them one
degrades oneself and to some degree
loses one's humanity and I think that
that's true nevertheless I can easily
imagine circumstances in which I would
have been glad to debate aitz for
example if there were some chance that
by debating aitz it might have been
possible to eliminate it or to at least
mitigate the horror of what was going on
and I think I feel the same way about
Vietnam and I really think that there is
no fundamentally there is no argument
anymore on on at an intellectual level
in my opinion but I think it's very
important to discuss it nevertheless at
what level is there an
argument well there
uh uh there is a policy which I think is
a destructive and devastating policy
it's continuing and uh the policy the
continuation of the policy is uh to some
extent based on the fact of public
apathy or public acceptance hence there
still is the necessity to convince
people that uh that they should act
strongly to put an end to this policy at
what point um was there an intellectual
argument at which point did an
intellectual argument in favor of our
intervening in Vietnam ceased to exist
well as I say there I think that there
may have been a time when there was
something to debate for example I think
that in the middle 50s though I was
opposed to the policy and I think that
it was right to be opposed to it
nevertheless I think it was a debatable
issue in a sense in which it is no it is
no longer a debatable issue why is that
because at the moment I think it's
really an issue of the survival of the
existence of Vietnam as a as an entity
as a social and cultural entity I think
that's what's at stake but even that
could be intellectually argued couldn't
it well in the same sense in which ashit
could be intellectually argu I mean in a
different sense no I think in the same
sense in fact don't forget there were
people who who argued in favor of ashz
and gave no no I haven't forgotten that
at all um haven't had any such on this
program though do I intend to but it
seems to me that um even if what you
said were correct there could be a
perfectly legitimate argument over for
instance the continuation of the state
of
angila or the continuation of the state
of bafra or the continuation of the
state of Goa I didn't I didn't me talk
about the existence of the state I
talked about the existence of the
society as a social and cultural entity
I think that's what's at stake oh okay
what if it's at stake might there be two
points of view about how to help it
evolve into its natural forms right oh
there are many different points of view
I think very legitimate very legitimate
see there're very legitimate issues that
can be argued as to how the United
States ought to most efficaciously put
an end to its destructive actions in
Vietnam there are many different
Alternatives that might be thought about
yes the one way of course to put an end
to America's necessary intervention is
to conclude the war successfully that's
a way yeah one possible way is by
destroying Vietnam which I think is
probably the most likely at yeah well
now for instance one way in which we put
an end to the Nazi occupation of France
was by destroying Nazi Germany correct
that's right and U uh it seems to me
that this was a position which is a
terible position and mutus mutandis is a
teral position no because mutus mutand
why explain to me why as you know it's
not only I but people with whom I
disagree like Arthur leser junor Who
refers to your theological certitudes
and your liberal application of them to
every subject in which you touch so the
subject of your own intolerance of other
people's point of view is I think itself
linguistically interesting first of all
I don't accept that uh criticism you see
if if you look at that quotation you'll
notice that I put it in there and recall
the context I said that when I argue the
issue I feel a tone of moral and
emotional falseness which I want to
explain but then I go ahead to argue the
issue so that's a side remark intended
to explain my own feeling of emotional
and moral falseness which is real I do
feel it but nevertheless I then go ahead
for 300 Pages or so to discuss this and
related issues so I don't I don't really
believe that it's fair to say that I'm
not willing to tolerate other position
the trou is you don't end the book by
saying I'm kind of odd in in feeling
this you say everybody is odd who
doesn't agree with me right no I don't
think so do I say this is certainly the
burden of your book uh um I wasn't aware
of that I mean I think that I've given
you know an argument maybe this is maybe
this a a universal difficulty you're
having not being aware of certain
people's reading of your position well
then let me say I think there are for
example I think I take a very qualified
and temperate position on many many
issues in this book for example take the
issue of uh the the background of the
second world war which I spent a lot of
time on if you notice I end up with a
statement saying that I don't see any
way to give a clear sharp resolution
clear sharp answer to the question what
we should have done under such and such
circumstances I discussed someone who
did take a very strong and I think very
honorable position namely AJ musty and I
say that I wish I could come out I wish
I could answer the question for myself
whether I feel that I would have taken
or would have rejected that position but
I don't see any way to do it because the
issue is mixed many issues I I feel that
way on the other hand see when the issue
is the uh you know when the issue is
let's say three million tons of bombs
dropped on Vietnam I don't feel that way
anymore nevertheless I'm still perfectly
willing to argue the issue yeah calmly
quietly and as you would have say the
dropping of the bombs in Bron exactly
yeah or the atom bomb let's see I would
have been willing to argue the dropping
the atom bomb though I do feel that it's
a war crime sure but I I do think that
you put some people at a
disadvantage by uh your AR PR
assertion that any position that
disagrees with your own is
intellectually a baron well I didn't
mean that really let me explain maybe it
didn't come across but what I what I
meant was something else I wanted to
honestly State uh my own emotional and
my own my own feeling about entering
into a debate over this issue P poroi
wise no I think that the point is that I
think it's only fair to an audience of
readers to say this is the way I
approach the issue and you read me on
the basis of this understanding the best
I can give as to the way I'm approaching
this issue and it's perfectly true that
when I do if you notice what I say is
that increasingly over the years in
discussing this issue I felt this
feeling of emotional and moral falseness
and I think it would only be honest to
express it sure then to go ahead with
the discussion quite so uh but you also
say that you hate yourself for not
having come to that position uh earlier
yeah I do I think that was a very great
great mistake well I hope to give you a
little Solace uh in the course of the
but
the reason I do raise this and and I I
rejoice in your disposition to argue the
Vietnam question especially when I
recognize what an act of self-control
this must uh involve it does sure it
really does I mean I think that this is
the kind of issue well sometimes I lose
my temper maybe not tonight maybe not
tonight uh because if you would I'd
smash you in the Goddamn
face the you say you say in your book
good reason for not
losing you say the war is simply an
obscenity a depraved act by weak and
miserable men including all of us
including myself including every that's
the next sentence same sentence sure
sure sure sure because you count
everybody in the company of the guilty I
think that's true in this case see one
of the points this sense of theological
observation isn't it no I don't think so
because as somebody points out if
everybody's guilty of everything then
nobody's guilty of anything no I well no
I don't I don't believe that see I think
that I think the point that I'm trying
to make and I think ought to be made is
that the
real at least to me I say this elsewhere
in the book The what seems to me a very
in a sense terrifying aspect of our
society and other societies is the
equinity and the Detachment with which
sane reasonable sensible people can
observe such events I think that's more
terrifying than the occasional Hitler or
lame or other that crops up these people
would not be able to operate were it not
for the this apathy and Equanimity and
therefore I think that it's in some
sense the sane and reasonable and
tolerant people who should who who share
a very serious burden of guilt that they
very easily throw on the shoulders of
others who seem more extreme and more
violent no I agree but uh but surely the
emotional temperature of uh of yourself
or of myself or or of other people is
not in and of itself an index an
automatic index to the righteousness of
our emotions certainly not as forance
people were approximately equally wrough
up in the late 30s of whether or not
America should help the Western powers
to defend themselves against the Axis
powers and I think it is incorrect to
suppose that people of either side were
necessarily uh right simply because they
were excis I'd agree with that totally
there's no connection whatsoever between
you know degree of emotion and degree of
correct but as you understand the
existing situation uh it ought to be in
your judgment a transparently evil thing
that we are engaged in and you are
derivatively concerned
because there
isn't because there is not a shared
sense of indignation like your like your
own now I don't say that I am right
because I am indignant rather I say that
I I think in this case I am right to be
indignant which is different I have to
prove that you are right to be indignant
if you are right that's right and that
has to be demonstrated that's why that
has demr dozens of pages of argument
about which may or may not convince
people convin me
sure but I
agree
right would let let me then excuse me
did I interrupt you I'm sorry let me ask
you this um if in fact your
concern is to
communicate uh your moral concern to
what extent have you spent um a
time thinking about your techniques now
I I say this seriously because uh it is
probably true that under certain
circumstances the communication of of
One's Own indignation and fury and
restraint is is best communicated to
emotionally I to one's own Satisfaction
by by screaming and yelling but if uh it
becomes observable that this doesn't
bring people around then you've got to
uh consider the problem of communication
it becomes a moral problem just as you
would consent to argue aitz or bu canol
with somebody if there was a chance of
of of dissipating something of the sort
now when if you have given that problem
any
thought do you do you well how come that
you you end up saying Junior book that
uh Senator Mike Mansfield is quotes the
kind of man who is the terror of our age
well let me put that in its context as
well what I say is I I believe that and
what I say is that Senator Mansfield is
an American intellectual in the best
sense a sane reasonable uh scholarly man
the kind of man who is the terror of our
age and that's essentially what I was
saying before I think that the terror of
our age is the mass man the sane
responsible serious quiet man who
watches these things unfold and doesn't
react to them I include myself in that
as I made tried to make clear in the
earlier statements well if um uh put it
this way your council is surely a
council of Despair uh if on the one hand
you are cous with your
own relative moral superiority and yet
end up despising
yourself uh appealing to
scrupulosity for your own shortcomings I
mean this makes this makes things pretty
not really for one thing I don't feel no
I don't feel any relative moral
superiority and I tried maybe failed but
I tried very hard to express that in the
book that I said somewhere in the
beginning that if there is any tone of
self-righteousness or anything like that
it's unintended and certainly undeserved
and I mean that very much see I mean
after all given the feelings that I have
which I've just expressed you know and
which you perceive uh I should be doing
really strong things which I don't think
I am doing so there's no there's no
sense of moral superiority and I'm not
interested in simply you know throwing
blame around or giving people marks I
think that the beginning of wisdom in
this case is to recognize something
about what we stand for in the world
what we're doing in the world and I
think when we do recognize that we will
feel an enormous sense of guilt and I
say somewhere in there that one should
be very careful not to let confessions
of guilt uh overcome the possibility of
action I say that confessions of guilt
can be very good therapy as they can as
is well known uh they they're also a
very good preventative action and I
think one should be very wary of that
fact I remember well I think we I think
we
should I think that your formulation of
it is U uh at least saintly but um uh it
still uh is um a dislocating at least to
people who fancy themselves as spending
an equal amount of time attempting to
refine their whole apparatus of moral
discrimination and who come up with
conclusions directly at variance with
your own now the reason I haven't asked
you at this moment to say you know why
are we in Vietnam and this because we've
been all arguing about this for four
five six years and the chances of our
coming up with anything especially in
you are small yeah that's one of the
respects in which I think it is sort of
an unarguable issue now you know the
issues of just one has been over them
over and over and over again yeah yeah
but there there there are perhaps
certain aspects of the quarrel in
Vietnam that uh touches especially on
your thesis and your concern and the
whole nature of it mhm uh and that is uh
the suspicion that some people
have of of a double standard of
selective indignation for instance you
refer to the heroic heroic Vietnamese
resistance to American power I think
it's absolutely heroic amazing I I I
understand if I understand enough about
language to understand the use of
heroism in that way if you notice there
are a few lines below I say or above I
say something about quite apart from any
question of politics right yeah now
suppose I would to write about um the
heroic resistance of the Nazis to The
Liberation Army for instance their use
of torture the use of mass reprisals I
don't consider that heroic why is that
heroic I mean that means that they were
doing no I don't think that heroism
doesn't well then I think we do disagree
on the use of
language against we do know have used uh
have used fire weapons to destroy whole
Villages children that they have dis
owed Mayors and so for and hung them up
and all that kind of St now this is I
understand no that is not that's
depraved that's in my opinion that's
very very marginal in why is it marginal
in fact it's marginal that's question of
fact in this uh um the in fact you know
this it's quite you know I think there's
perfect unanimity about this in the
people whove studied it for example if
you look at someone like say Douglas
Pike you know American Foreign Service
agent who the chief expert on the vietn
on on the Viet Kong and you read his
book carefully you discover that he
points out that it was uh inresponse to
the American Military effort that the
Viet Kong turned from their attempt to
build mass popular support by uh through
or through the organizational methods
that involved giving people an actual
role in uh organizing and controlling
their own society and institutions they
turn from that to physical force in
reaction to the American intervention
and if you read if you if I have many
examples of this quote in the book from
Aid documents let's say or from
pacification manuals where people point
out by the same Tok you can say that the
Nazis turn to torture in France are in
reaction to Eisenhower's Landing in in
Normandy the answer is the people so
disposed to act are certain kinds of
people and I yearn for a recognition of
this in your writings or in Douglas
Pikes as a matter of fact Douglas
as you know has certain difficulty with
the fact that it is acknowledged that up
to 25 30,000 people were individually
killed by terrorists before America the
it was between 1958 and 1962 I think a
9,000 is the figure that's given usually
well right and and these and it's
interesting to see what it was I mean if
one really wants to talk about Viet Kong
Terror During the period prior to the
American intervention then again I think
just about all commentators Dennis
Warner Bernard F whoever you like has
agreed that uh by and large this was
Terror directed extremely selectively
against oppressive and external Village
officials was selected burning of Jon of
Arc was selective too the point is it
was intended to establish a universal
point extion of ikan selective well but
you see there's a very big diff I think
you see if you want to personally I'm
against all kinds of Terror no question
but if you want to understand the Viet
Kong situation then let's recognize a
very great distinction at least I recog
let's see what the political point of
the terror was see after all there were
during that period there were about 9 or
10,000 uh according to American sources
there were maybe 9 or 10,000 Village
officials of one sort or another uh
killed by the Viet Kong largely with the
support of The Villages that's what but
at the same time recall that there were
perhaps 160,000 Vietnamese if we accept
Berard false figures again killed by The
Saigon government and the Americans This
is prior to 1965 that was a very
different kind of Terror both in
quantity and also in its political yeah
I know but if if it seems to me that
you're are attempting here to match uh
things which are not uh uh uh which are
not
equal
160,000 no
means point I need say that number my
point is that one presumably
distinguishes between an act of Terror
terrorism which you call depraved a
moment ago uh and uh what you descri
burill is depraved a military action
part milit which is even more depraved
for example you see well let me give you
some examples of what I consider
depraved actions uh Malcolm Brown back
in 1962 or three I don't remember
reported it was a I think AP or up cars
on reported that uh Saigon officials
were sending American Skyhawks you know
airplanes over over vietnames Vietnamese
villages to wipe them out with Napal
raids in order to cover instances of
graft for example well that's I think
depraved and suddenly I don't condemn
that because you see uh just to mention
this matter of double standard there are
really three kinds of Terror in Vietnam
there's Viet Kong Terror there's the
Saigon government Terror and there's
American Terror and if you read what
I've written I say practically nothing
about either Viet Kong Terror or Terror
carried out by the saon government uh
now if one wanted to talk about that one
would have to point out that the terror
carried out by the Saigon government is
incredibly greater in extent and has a
very different political purpose which
one could discuss but I restrict myself
to discussing americ on that generality
but I I GA that you believe it go ahead
I do and we could you know that then
does become matter of fact which one
could discuss yeah but I as a matter of
principle almost uh restrict myself to
the discussion of American Terror
neither not the terror carried out by
the various sides in Vietnam for many
reasons for one thing because it's just
qualitatively different in scale and for
another thing because I I feel that we
have some responsibility for it see I
don't uh in the same sense I don't talk
about that you know I've never written
about the terror carried out by both
sides in Nigeria let's say uh I don't
like it obviously but I don't see any
point in my giving them good or bad
marks for it on the other hand if we
were carrying out the terror I would
very definitely write about it and I
think so there's no double standard as
far as I can see at least let's say I
have a stand in mind what may or may not
accept it we will explore that
okay uh Mr chsky we're talking there
about American uh Terror and I think you
make a very accurate observation that we
are responsible for what we do but
hardly responsible for what uh other
people do except in so far as we are in
a position to influence them for
instance if there is a mass
starvation in a b
even though we did not cause it there is
a sense in which we are responsible if
we don't do something to attempt to
alleviate it now by the same token uh if
we are prepared to agree that uh uh it
is not always easy to taxonomize
military action into that which is
terroristic and that which is purely
military
operation we we are left with uh with
doubts for instance about the bombing of
Germany in 1942 4344
you might contend that this was
terroristic and unnecessary and you
might be right although you're not a
military expert neither am I but I do
think there's a point to that yeah but I
I do judge that U uh even if we all
agreed that what we did in resden was
inexcusable uh uh as a moral question
has got to be understood in context of
what was it that brought us to Dron in
the first instance absolutely and what
brought us to South Vietnam in the first
instance in my judgment was clearly uh a
an uninterested or I should say
disinterested uh concern for the uh
stability and possibilities of a region
of the world to which period at what
period do you feel that we had this
disinterested relationship to Viet right
now now at what period did we have it
did it begin let's say 1951 for example
when we when the state department
bulletin points out that we must help
the French uh reconquer their former
colony and we must eradicate all
Vietnamese resistance down to its last
roots in order to reestablish the was
to increase my vulnerability I wish we
had help the French we did we we we
support not sufficiently not
sufficiently there's no point helping
somebody insufficient it was hardly
disinterested when we attempted as you
know with with tremendous uh support in
fact to reinstate French imperialism in
South Vietnam it was disinterested in
this sense and and I think this an
important distinction which you to touch
on your book it's a disinterested act uh
if of my attempt to help or your attempt
to help a particular nation is in order
to spare you the possibility of a great
ordeal in the future which will harm you
your family your children Republic in
that sense not not Germany was also
disinterested after all Nazi Germany was
conquering Eastern Europe only in order
to advance the values of Christian
spiritual civilization and to restore
the Slavs to their rightful home and so
on and so forth totally I follow you I
follow you but uh if if you want me to
pursue that digression I will okay but
uh but let's suspend it for a moment
okay I'm distinguishing that kind of
disinterestedness between the kind with
that's not kind of disinterestedness
that you see that's that's something
which includes as a special case every
case of military aggression and
colonialism in history it's all this
interested in your sense well all right
let let me simply rest my case by saying
that there is an observable distinction
by intelligent men between a country uh
that reaches out and interferes with the
Affairs of another country uh because it
has reason to believe that a failure to
do so will result in Universal misery
and and that country which reaches out
interferes with another country because
it wants to establish Coca-Cola plants
there and Chase National Banks and and
and whatever and exploited now that is
an observable it's a conceptual let's
distinguish between a conceptual
distinction and factual to do that it is
a conceptual distinction but in actual
fact the history of colonialism shows
that these two motivations con uh
coincide that is practically every Ian
there are exceptions you know the
probably the belgians and and the Congo
are an exception but by and large the
Maj imperialist Ventures have been in
the economic uh in the material interest
or in the perceived material I'm not
interested in the mathematics but I'm
let meish you have already conceded that
it's not merely a conceptual difference
there are Exceptions there are a few
exceptions like say let's talk about the
exceptions then well no but the
exceptions are at the difference no wait
a minute the exceptions I I mentioned
for example the belgians and the Congo
there they didn't have they didn't even
pretend to have a civilizing mission
there it was pure material self-interest
that these are the Exceptions there are
as far as I know no exceptions on the
other side there are there are I mean
maybe I've left out a case of history
but as I see the history of colonialism
the great massive cases are cases where
a powerful country was working in its
perceived material self-interest and was
covering what it was doing to itself and
to the world with uh very pleasant
phrases about uh preserving Christian
values or helping the poor bited natives
or one thing or another now there are a
few exceptions where there was pure
predatory imperialis ISM no not even any
pretense of doing anything but these are
quite rare and we're in the mainam
imperialism in pure predatory imperialis
sure the the history of the Roman Empire
well let's take I mean since the
Industrial Revolution since the
industrial re well if you say the people
who refine the art of apologetics I
don't deny it but uh it is it is also
true and I think manifestly true uh that
uh uh there have been interferences with
the Affairs of other nations whose
purposes were in my judgment manifestly
benign for example or for for instance
the Truman Doctrine oh I don't think
that was manifestly benign at all that
was an attempt to devel I think the
situation not at all we were I say the
Greek's testimony is more interesting to
me than yours which Greek testimony the
T testimony of the thousands of people
who thrown into jail and uh not no not I
I I grant not the testimony of the Greek
Communists who were beaten or the Greek
peasants who were you well I there again
is it a conceptual difference that uh
between the person who desires a life
under some kind of freedom and one who
desires life under some kind of under
communism well no because there's no
there's no such opposition in Greek
there in Greece there was a distinction
between a very repressive regime which
we instituted in 1946 and another regime
I don't know what it would have been
that would have grown out of a victory
of the so-called Communists now if you
see what we did was had nothing to do
with freedom what we instituted was this
absolute historical romantic because the
number of people who were slaughtered in
Greece first by the communist Insurgency
then by the Nazis then again by the
communist communist Insurgency before
the Nazis not Insurgency Conquest
communist Conquest before the Nazis
Insurgency prior to the Naz yes the
Civil War of the early 40s my Naz your
history is quite confus there was no
there was no communist Insurgency prior
to the Nazis there were communist
resistance bans this is a matter of
nomenclature the point is that the The
40-Year-Old or the the 4 5-year-old
Greek has fought three times uh in
certain Ventures there in one of which
they acknowledge that we bail them who
they out who is they the rulers of
Greece acknowledge that no no also the
people oh I I'm quite unaware of that
I'm quite unaware that the people of
Greece have spoken on this issue even
Pap andreo you like him I assume because
he hates us no not Pap all George Pap
andreo was one of the people who I'm
talking about yeah and I'm talking about
Andrea which makes it even Andrea both
very both on record as being grateful to
President Truman for his intervention in
that part of the world in
194e with him on that issue I mean I
really think we had no right to
intervene in Greece in 1947 no now we're
talking about rights which gets us way
from which gets us away from the
discussion let's talk about right let's
talk about whether disc is whether or
not whether or not there is there is
such a thing as relatively disinterested
International interference and it seems
to me that America's record is rather
good we went through an imperialist
phase but we we pulled out out of it
faster than any country in the history
of civilization I think we're very deep
why we pull out of the Philippines for
instance we pulled out of the
Philippines because it became a bad
investment because American uh America
if you look American Agricultural
interests were very much opposed to the
back in in the mid-30s they were very
strongly opposed to the uh free trade
relationships which allowed Philippine
crops to compete with them that's why we
pulled out of the Philippines why do
they why do these agricultural interest
authoriz us to intervene in South
Vietnam they didn't if you consider this
this is because we didn't intervene on
no I say that in the Philippines it was
the critical look the world is a complex
place there are certain interests that
were involved MIT is a complex Place
well there were certain interests that
were involved in our Philippine Venture
there are different interests that are
involved in our Vietnam Venture you see
our Vietnam don't forget that with the
second world war America's Imperial
interests expanded enormously I mean
prior to the second world war we were
sort of a marginal imperialist power
except for the monra doctrine but since
the second world war we became the
world's major imperialist power and
Vietnam is simply one piece of an
attempt to construct a very large
integrated World System of which Greece
was another piece yeah we became an
imperial pal jsky in this sense in the
sense that we inherited primary
responsibility for uh any chain of
action that might involve us in a Third
World War I don't believe and and
something that might involve the entire
world in Holocaust under circumstances
well I know you don't believe it but but
uh in I think might be refreshing to
listen to this point of view which is
that uh there are people who do believe
that that America unhappily and
certainly not Desiring it inherited the
responsibility for trying to abort
International Holocaust and has from
time to time done so by such Ventures as
the Truman Doctrine martial Aid and
things like that martial Aid not maral
is quite first of all Marsh I'm
sorry I interrupted you I'm sorry well
first of all you've now mentioned
Marshal aid for the first time and
Marshal Aid Marshal plan Aid has to be
distinguished quite sharply from the
Truman Doctrine why why because the
Truman Doctrine was a doctrine of
military intervention and the Marshall
Plan was our first attempt at a major
you do understand that sometimes a
soldier can be as useful as a bushel of
wheat don't you no look nevertheless if
we're going to be at all clear about the
American role we're certainly going to
distinguish between military
intervention and economic intervention
they're very different in the way they
function now the fact of the matter is
that neither was disinterested in your
sense I don't think but they're very
different in the impact that they had uh
the kman Doctrine I think was a
disastrous Venture I think the Marshall
Plan uh was arguable I mean one
understood what how you explain the
schizophrenia how do you explain the
schizophrenia of a public which willed
both more or less simultaneously on the
one hand you say the public is
ined public didn't will either the
government the government because
because both were but the government
back by the public has that how do you
explain that the same government on on
Monday uh did the Truman Doctrine which
you consider simply sort of be a
projection of the evil impulses of the
government on Tuesday is something which
you consider to be very good what
happened to the government Monday and
Tuesday first of all I didn't say I
consider it to be very good I said it's
very it's rather different and and one
has to bring different standards to bear
in evaluating it why why is it different
let me give you an example suppose
you're a farmer because tempor and you
need agriculture you need fertilizer so
you apply to me for fertilizer but just
before I get it to you somebody comes up
with a Bayonet and is about to uh is is
about to make it impossible for you to
continue forming now in that particular
instance is there a strategic difference
between my giving the fertilizer and my
giving the the soldier who that's not
you're talking about the dream world the
real world is one because the real world
is one in which the Alternatives were
bringing uh coming with a Bayonet which
is on an American Rifle held by an
american-backed uh Greek Soldier and the
alternative to that was giving the kind
of Aid which was used in fact to
construct the kind of society in Western
Europe that we wanted to see develop
there now these are two very different
things it's a very thing to introduce uh
to run for the Greek army uh a
counterinsurgency program with military
support and many military men involved
that's one kind of thing one sort of
repression imposed on the Greek
population through American intervention
one might argue whether it's right or
wrong but that's that's to be very sharp
disting imposed why do you say imposed
is it because your presumption here my
presumption is your presumption here is
is that the Greeks would like the kind
of regime my my assumption is that all
intervention is imposed by any country
that is any you see I I believe that
quite generally we impose on the French
when we liberated the them from the
Nazis was that an imposition we didn't
conquer France we moved the the ger out
of from from an outside invading Force
we invaded But we didn't conquer it from
its own people see in Greece we were
trying to conquer it from its own people
but there you're willing to credit the
anti-nazis as their own people but
you're not in Greece willing to credit
the anman Army the German Army was there
there was no outside Army in Greece
other than ours look there are
modalities of outside interven but look
there's a very sharp difference between
just minute there's a very sharp
difference was not a Nazi but laal
wouldn't have lasted for 5 minutes
without the German Army and no nor would
nor would macaros have lasted for five
minutes without the help of Russian aid
but wait a fact you know
got but look now let's let's be careful
again I mean there's a difference
between first of all I'm opposed to
military aid to other countries whether
by us or by the Soviet Union well let's
come back to that because it's a more
important thing and that is that I'm
even far more opposed to the uh
imposition of regimes by Foreign troops
now in the case of Germany let's say in
the case of France the uh the pan
government the pan laal government the
vishi government was supported by German
troops had the German mil they weren't
throughout the country necessarily
because there was certainly indigenous
support but there's no question that if
German military force had been withdrawn
to the other side of the r uh then there
would have been a an overthrow of the
vishi government and France would have
had some different form of government
now in that case our invasion of France
was uh whether one likes it or not was
is was in reaction to an occupying
external force it just pure confusion to
identify that with the case of Greece
when we were trying to liberate uh we
were trying to select the kind of
society that Greek Greece would have and
we were trying to save the rulers that
we had designated as appropriate from
their own population there were no
outside forces but don't you realize
that in your book uh and that's why
you're not willing to to be consistent
in carrying out this argument you
constantly talking about our sellz in of
places like uh uh Cuba and the Dominican
Republic and so on so forth and yet we
never occupied them in the sense in what
you're talking about well we never
occupied the Dominican Republic we sent
25,000 troops there in 1965 in an
occupation no I'm talking about pre I'm
talking about well the American Marines
were in there dozens of times I think
you're being evasive and I don't think
you want to be let me ask you this is it
possible not of all I you know we just
simply repeatedly sent troops to
Dominican Republic Cuba etc etc is it
possible to sat allize a nation without
having an occupying Army there yes it is
all right then there goes your French
your tedious French explanation not at
all because that doesn't happen to be
the you see we're talking about a real
situation we could talk about some ideal
situation and you know have an academic
discussion I'm saying therefore it is
possible for Vietnam to sattie South
Vietnam presumably without even it's
it's logically militarily in any formal
sense but it didn't happen though so
there's point an argument considering
which there's there two points of view
let disc it historically yeah in fact
you see there's much more if if you want
to be serious about it there's more
evidence that South Vietnam tried to
colonize North Vietnam then conversely
in fact South Viet well look South
Vietnamese Commandos were going a
military forces regular military forces
were going north uh considerably earlier
than than the time when we even
proclaimed that the infiltration began
from north to south did they bump into
the refugees coming south the refugees
were coming south in uh were going both
directions in fact in 1954 55 and
according at least according to Bernard
fall the uh Commandos began going north
in 56 or 57 the first claimed
infiltration from the north was in 59
and that was South Vietnamese coming
south so if we you know if one wants to
talk about again the real world the
first motion of
the your difficulty Mr TR is in my
judgment you never know where neatly to
begin your historical you the point of
beginning well the the point really is
that um if you if you're starting to say
that 1959 was a provocation because it
were no it wasn't a provocation clim
that the how about the people who are
going from north to south who were
talking about the misery that had been B
by when I mean well which people are you
talking about I don't know well well I'm
talking about Vietnamese North and and
South your TR is neatly captured in in
in in the remark made recently by cze
Slovakia that uh Czechoslovakia is after
all the most neutralist country in the
world since it declines in interfere
even with its own Internal
Affairs I don't see the relevance well
well the relevance is very simply that U
uh you you you start your line of
discussion at a moment that is
historically useful for you that's I you
pick the you the beginning world is that
the Communist communist imperialists by
the use of terrorism by the use of by
deprivation of Freedom uh have
contributed to the continuing Bloodshed
and the sad thing about it is not only
the Bloodshed but the fact that this
seem to dispossess you of the power of
rational may I say something I think
that's about 5% true and about or maybe
10% true it certainly is why do you give
that may I complete a sentence I it's
it's perfectly true that there were
areas of the world in particular Eastern
Europe where uh where stalinist
imperialism uh uh very brutally uh took
control and still maintains control but
there are also very vast areas of the
world where we were doing the same thing
and uh there's quite an interplay in the
Cold War you see the what you just
described is a I believe a mythology
about the Cold War which might have been
tenable 10 years ago but which is quite
inconsistent with contemporary
scholarship ask a check ask ask a
Guatemalan ask a Dominican uh ask
president of the Dominican Republic ask
you know ask a ask a person from South
Vietnam you know ask obviously we can't
get if you can't distinguish between the
nature of our Venture in Guatemala and
the nature of the Soviet unions in
Prague we have real exp explain the
sor
uh Mr Greenfield Mr Chomsky you you
state in one of the essays in your book
The unpleasant fact is that if one
wishes to pursue the Munich analogy
there is only one plausible candidate
for the role of Hitler and by that you
mean the United States there are other
references to Nazi Germany's conduct of
foreign policy and our own and you also
less emphatically suggest that a lot of
the internal policies of the United
States government have left millions of
its own citizens hungry or exploited
if this is the fact that is to say if
the nature of our society is
functionally indistinguishable in this
respect from from Nazi Germany then
doesn't that legitimate any tactic that
one wishes to use in opposition well I
certainly don't believe that your
assumption that is I don't believe and I
don't think I ever say that our society
is functionally indistinguishable from
Nazi Germany what I say is that wants to
want zero yeah so if by blowing up a
Troop Train we prevent 5,000 American
soldiers from going to Viet to
participate in what you do explicitly
call a criminal War right isn't that a
moral act oh I think that yes it would
be if sabotage would in fact contribute
to ending the War I would be in favor of
sabotage let me give you some concrete
examp a tactical decision not a tal
decision in fact I'll give you some
examples what the barans have done for
example at cville in Milwaukee I think
is very heroic and in fact saintly but
that is not killing American soldiers oh
no I'm not well you were talking about
sabotaging about blowing up a Troop
Train I would assume there'll be L life
I'm sorry I thought you meant let's say
you know stop preventing a train from
going I mean blowing up I mean sabotage
assassination you know what what all the
heroes in I I would first of all make a
sharp distinction as for example the
bans did between attacks on property and
attacks on people that's what I
fundamental distinction but then you see
if one raises the question about uh
attacks on people then I think there are
very tricky issues see one would I can
conce I'm you know I would have been
against assassinating Hitler for example
because I'm against murder but if I
believed that assassination of Hitler
would have really contributed to the end
of the to ending the War I think one
could have given an argument given an
argument now if if it Lyndon Johnson and
that would pertain to Linda Johnson but
uh in neither case incidentally do I
think that it practically would have
and uh Miss
hawman I would like to ask Mr Buckley
what he thinks the motives of the people
who are in favor of the war in Vietnam
are uh putting it very simply um how can
we possibly hope to help Universal
misery when we are so miserable here
well I think we're less miserable here I
mean uh I don't I I'm I'm you may not be
a a happy young lady but I'm sure you're
not as miserable as you would be if for
instance you didn't have a free press if
you weren't able to write such poetry as
you wanted to write if you couldn't join
a labor union if you couldn't express
yourself as you liked uh uh if uh uh
you're uh the mayor of your town might
be uh disemboweled uh tomorrow I think
that there there are observable
differences aren't you in favor between
the nature between what Freedom you have
here or or put it this way between your
misery and theirs if youry if you
wouldn't have saturation bombing I I
want to disagree with you for the moment
because I I think that um there is a
certain condition a human condition the
condition of guilt which Mr Chomsky
speaks about and which for me is the
most interesting point of his argument
the guilt that we feel here which in a
way may keep people from writing poetry
or from writing anything that they think
because they're absolutely um stifled by
theate of guilt get on the best h of
this excuse me they managed to write
their complaints but I know of many
people who are not who are not writing
now because of the war in Vietnam who
are not functioning because of their
guilt well it's not it's not it's not an
aspect of my responsibility for foreign
policy to encourage you to externalize
your complaints but if if you want to
there are any number of book publishers
magazine Publishers and radio station
television stations who are glad to hear
them out which I think is qualitatively
different from what exists for instance
in North Vietnam or south or Greece or
Greece for example or Brazil do of other
countries a little bit less so sure less
so I think it's true no that's not true
publishing I what's true what's true is
that a nation at War does not have the
same Amel of Liberties as a nation at
peace Abraham Lincoln suspended the
right to hius Corpus and the oldest
parliament in history of the world
didn't have an election for 11 years
during you know if you compare the state
of freedom in North and South Vietnam
prior to the war as some people have
done like Joseph buttinger I'm afraid it
doesn't come out the way you like well I
think it does come out the way not by
the evidence that's been present as the
refugees who or number the refugees who
left North Vietnam compare them with
those who left South Vietnam that's
that's a very different issue I what I
said if you what I was talking about is
the right of free expression in North
and South Vietnam I mean take a look for
example at but's analysis you know where
he runs through cases
uh quite apart from that take a look at
for example again you know pick your
Authority I mean Let It Be Bernard fall
let it be almost anyone you like see
there's a great amount of Village
democracy which was instituted in North
Vietnam and in fact has also been
instituted in the an left dominated
areas of South Vietnam which is
something qualitatively different than
anything that has existed in Asian
societies before and this exists
simultaneously with let me be quite
clear this exists simultaneously with a
good deal of repression and certainly
not civil liberties of the sort that we
are used to one of the most Libertarian
constitutions in the history of the
world was written by the Soviet Union
I'm not talking about constitutions my
point is what kind of freedom is
experienced by somebody in North Vietnam
the answer is that the freedom is
perpetually insecure oh well you don't
know for reasons well I know hoi Min
himself has wept over the occasional
necessity to kill 40 50,000 of his own
not the necessity the occasional fact uh
but just but just uh just one moment
what I was talking yeah very not only
sarcastic but also wrong and you see
it's very important to recognize if you
want to understand understand what
communism means in Southeast Asia to
realize that along with many
authoritarian and repressive practices
which I certainly don't condone there is
on the side a great deal of
democratization there's been a
liberation of energies and involvement
nonsense I say so I don't think you're
right after all the great the great the
great Paradigm of red China in which the
aflci itself concedes to uh uh to
Something in the neighborhood of 20
million victims on that particular I'm
talking according to them
perap they didn't ask you whe that was
correct they have a commission out there
no one has claimed the million people
killed through through Chinese Communist
Pur absolutely no one no one serious at
least quite it was published in the new
leader fine the new leader of course the
new leader might I mean but I'm talking
CIA plant well I said no one serious has
take a look at the China Journal take a
look at
China you see I think you're missing the
point really and I think it's an
important Point see I think in looking
at China one has to recognize a great
deal of repressive practice a great deal
of authoritarian ISM and one also has to
recognize a great deal of of spontaneous
Democratic structure of a sort which
never existed in Asia before and if you
want to know the truth to some extent
doesn't even exist in our society now
these things exist side by side you read
a day the of denisovich you find out
that there's an extraordinary Democratic
structure even inside concentration
camps but it seems to me that it's
almost profane to make this observation
I think it's profane to make that
analogy because I'm talking about true
democracy in which I think so look in
which people in which the the people who
the peasants who live in a village
control the institutions of their lives
they control the the organ you bump into
the Berlin Wall on either side of the
there's no Berlin Wall in China there's
the equivalent of a Berlin Wall there's
the sea and there's starvation the con
no there's no that's just the point you
see starvation has been very largely
overcome in China yeah because they
because they have something like 94% of
people working on agriculture but I
think Mr D has a question for you they
also had enough two bumper crops in the
last few years uh Professor ch when you
say as you said about 30 minutes ago
that there's a relativity of Truth
between nations would you classify
relativity of truth I don't relativity
of Truth you said in the international
scene I don't understand the comment if
I said I don't know what it means well
would you call yourself a political
would you call yourself a political Rel
Rel relativist I I don't understand the
concept well put it this way do you
believe in a natural law in uh
transcendental truth let's say a fixing
social
unit I think that there's
there's something to the doctrine of
natural law but I I think that that's
much more abstract than anything we've
been discussing here well but uh
wouldn't that then justify the use of
Terror in um let's say stopping a ATT
tenant of the natural law from being
broken or stopping let's say the ends
from let's bring it down to earth I see
I'm of course opposed to Terror any
rational person is but I think that if
we're serious about the question of
Terror serious about the question of
violence we have to recognize that uh
that it is a tactical and hence moral
matter incidentally tactical issues are
basically moral issues they have to do
with human consequences and if we're
interested in let's say diminishing the
amount of violence in the world it's at
least arguable and perhaps even
sometimes true that a terroristic act
does diminish the amount of violence in
the world hence a person who was opposed
to violence will not be opposed to that
terroristic act R is exactly the same
thing that's right yeah and he happens
to be wrong in the case in which he
applies it you see these principles tell
you very little about real cases but
that's what's that's I must say that's
the one thing that bothers me more what
you've been saying in the way you write
that that that kind of language that is
the notion of a terroristic act which
restricts consequent violence is
precisely what rostow says in the view
from the seventh floor when after this
whole analysis about the moral world he
says there's not a single place where we
don't have major military might to
support it I think that the the real
Point here is that when you try to
formulate general principles that will
apply to arbitrary political uh Affairs
you find very that you can only make
very vacuous and empty statements see if
one wants to talk in perfect abstraction
from any real situation about the
justification for violence and Terror
then you come up with platitudes and
empty remarks and so on the point is
that you know there are no very general
principles that apply to such
circumstances or if there are no one has
enunciated and formulated them so what
one really has to do is look at the
concrete historical situation now where
I would disag maybe rosto and I would
agree at this level of abstraction on on
uh the use of violence to prevent less
viol more greater VI violence where we
would disagree is in our evaluation of
what is happening in this concrete
historical situation so and that's where
one's attention ought to so therefore
you have no philosophical objection to
the way in which Mr Rost States this
case merely to its applicability
existing circumstan no I say at this
level I would I might not I don't know
what he says about but in other things I
have a great difference for example Walt
rostow says that we should try to
strength that the great threat of China
to us is that it will succeed and
provide a model to other countries and
we have to make sure that that doesn't
happen is that why you kept him out of
MIT I I assure you that I had nothing to
do with keeping him out of MIT I'd be
delighted to have him back he's a great
help to us when he's around thank you
very much Mr tomsky thank you
