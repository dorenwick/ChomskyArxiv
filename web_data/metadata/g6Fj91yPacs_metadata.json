He is an American theoretical linguist whose work from the 1950s revolutionised the field of linguistics by treating language as a human and biologically based cognitive capacity. His works have also contributed greatly to epistemology, particularly the existence of a priori innate knowledge.\n\n#NoamChomsky #Chomsky #JustWar #Pacifism",
