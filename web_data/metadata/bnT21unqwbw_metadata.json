  "title": "Noam Chomsky on the Future of Marxism & Anarchism - Economic Update with Richard Wolff",
  "description": "We'll have a new episode of Economic Update for you next week. In the meantime, take a look back to the start of the year, when Noam Chomsky joined the program. \n\nChomsky: \"Take the common thread of left Marxist and anarchist thinking: working people should control the work environment and the enterprises in which they work. That's an old American view, so common that it was the slogan of the Republican party under Abraham Lincoln. It was the main driving force for the most effective radical movements in American history: knights of labor, and the populist movement of the late 19th century. I don't think that's very far below the surface and I think that can be recovered.\"\n\nThis is a clip from Economic Update: Noam Chomsky on Prospects & Tasks as 2021 Begins\n[S11 E01]\nWatch the full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS8qzcGDP5U\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nWe make it a point to provide the show free of ads.
