  "title": "UKRAINE IN NATO A THREAT TO RUSSIA - Noam Chomsky",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky, the most peer-reviewed scholar on the planet, explains that since 1990 NATO has marched ever closer to Russia's borders, threatening their security. After installing a regime linked to neo-nazis in 2014, the US has toyed with the idea of allowing Ukraine to join NATO, something which goes to the very core of Russian security interests.",
