  "description": "After more than a decade of left-leaning governments being elected to power across Latin America, some have now lost power, and others are now embroiled in political and economic crises.\n\nNoam Chomsky, a long time supporter of Latin American emancipation, says that despite being in \"a period of regression\" it is the first time in 500 years that the region has \"pretty much extricated itself from foreign control\".\n\nChomsky also dismisses that the United States is reaching out to Cuba as \"the way it's put in Western propaganda\" pointing to the fact that the US \"has been carrying [out] a bitter war on Cuba, a terrorist war\" and that the Obama administration was forced to open up to Cuba as its position was becoming increasingly isolated in the hemisphere.\n\nWatch more from Mehdi Hasan's interview with Noam Chomsky: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/01/noam-chomsky-clinton-sanders-160129141746906.html\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n- Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",
