  "description": "For the first time, watch the interview everyone's been talking about: The Great Noam Chomsky Debate. Really, it's more like a respectful conversation in which Brie & Virgil try to gain insight into how the left can make itself heard beyond November 3rd. \n\nYou've heard folks confidently give their takes without having listened to the conversation. Now you can do what they've declined to do: be informed.\n\nSubscribe at www.patreon.com/badfaithpodcast to hear the last 20 minutes of the episode in which Virgil Texas and Briahna Joy Gray breakdown the argument and vent about what could have been. Many people are saying that's the best part.",
