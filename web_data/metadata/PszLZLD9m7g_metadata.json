  "title": "Noam Chomsky - The New War on Terror [MIT, Full].flv",
  "description": "Not sure but I think this was on Feb, 2 2012. A College Lecture by Noam Chomsky about the War on Terror, How America is a Terroist State and as Chomsky always reiterates, that the best way to end terrorism is to stoop participating in it.\r\n\r\nThis talk has alot of historical info from Nicuragua to Turkey and the USA involvement in blocking Democracy around the world.\r\n\r\nNow unless you have ever heard of Chomsky before, I advise you listen to a few of his lectures before you write him off as anti american or a communist.\r\n\r\n-Peace",
