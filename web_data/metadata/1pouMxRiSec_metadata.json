  "description": "[NOTE: there was a technical error for a portion of Noam's presentation that caused the audio to cut. We've added captions to correct the missing audio, but there are a few errors as it was generated automatically. The audio is resolved later in the video itself.]\n\nPlease join The New Press and The People’s Forum for the launch of Noam Chomsky and Vijay Prashad’s The Withdrawal: Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Fragility of U.S. Power. Coinciding with the one-year anniversary of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, leading public intellectuals Chomsky and Prashad discuss the past twenty years of American imperialism, and their horrifying outcomes- disastrous interventions in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan as well as the engineering of a new security state with unprecedented powers of surveillance and detention.\n\nAs the final moments of American power in Afghanistan fade from view, this crucial book argues that we must not take our eyes off the wreckage—and that we need, above all, an unsentimental view of the new world we must build together.\n\nA discussion will be followed by a Q&A and book signing by Vijay Prashad.",
