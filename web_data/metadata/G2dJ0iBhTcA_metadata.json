  "description": "One of America's leading radical intellectuals, Professor Emeritus\r\nNoam Chomsky of MIT--co-author of \"Manufacturing Consent\"--gives a speech\r\non how the American people are highly propagandized and manipulated by the government and the press, so that the elites who control the US political and economic system can govern as they wish without democratic interference. He shows that the resulting US foreign policy has been to brutalize much of the world, particularly the Third World.\r\n\r\n ¤ Alternative Views\r\n441: THE LYING ELITES (PART I) (1991)\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Views\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/64ukq5h\r\nRecorded March, 1989\r\nCopyright April, 1991\r\n\r\n¤ Noam Chomsky\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky\r\nhttp://www.chomsky.info/\r\n\r\nThis movie is part of the collection: Alternative Views\r\n\r\nProducer: Frank Morrow\r\nProduction Company: Alternative Information Network\r\nAudio/Visual: sound, color\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States\r\n\r\nFor more videos and commentary from Critical Thought Agenda visit:\r\nwww.criticalthoughtagenda.com\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CTAgenda",
