  "title": "üò± Why WW3 CANNOT happen - Noam Chomsky #nuclear #shorts #shortsfeed",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky makes it perfectly clear why WWIII cannot happen: even a small nuclear exchange would point us toward the end of humanity. This is precisely why brinksmanship is so dangerous.\n\nAccording to Britannica: Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) is an American theoretical linguist whose work from the 1950s revolutionized the field of linguistics by treating language as a uniquely human, biologically based cognitive capacity. Through his contributions to linguistics and related fields, including cognitive psychology and the philosophies of mind and language, Chomsky helped to initiate and sustain what came to be known as the ‚Äúcognitive revolution.‚Äù Chomsky also gained a worldwide following as a political dissident for his analyses of the pernicious influence of economic elites on U.S. domestic politics, foreign policy, and intellectual culture.",
