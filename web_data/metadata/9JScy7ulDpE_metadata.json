  "title": "Noam Chomsky - The Merge Function In Thought And Speech",
  "description": "Longer than most of the videos of this type which I upload, but nonetheless, it is not as intimidating as it appears. Here, Noam Chomsky describes a facet of mathematical set theory that is used in the Universal Grammar to formulate more complicated sentences from simpler ones, hence contributing to his theory that sentences are potentially infinite in size yet formed from distinct quanta and formulae. Anyone familiar with writing poetry according to such techniques as metre or grammatic parallelism would not find this view of language alien to them.",
