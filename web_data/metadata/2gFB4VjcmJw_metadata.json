  "title": "Fetzer on Chomsky: Linguistics & 9/11",
  "description": "James H. Fetzer, prof. of philosophy (U.of Minnesota, Duluth, ret.), critiques Noam Chomsky's linguistics and Chomsky's noted acceptance of the official 9/11 story, the basis for the 'war on terrorism'. Jim Fetzer is the author of The Evolution of Intelligence which challenges Chomsky and Jerry Fodor \"and the thesis that learning a language requires a language learning module...\" Our view is that while language is a crucial step toward 'consciousness', it is not consciousness, it does not imply consciousness. For a more metaphorically useful description of consciousness, see Julian Jaynes Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Jaynes posits a pre-conscious (bicameral) era - a highly civilized era, in a sense - that gave way to our 'conscious' era, an era and a phenomenon  carefully defined by the Princeton psychologist.
