  "title": "Debunking Chomsky's Language Theory: Insights from Modern Models",
  "description": "Modern language models have challenged and disproved Chomsky's approach to language, which claimed that language is innate. These models have implemented genuine theories of language, including representations of syntactic and semantic structure, and have discovered grammar without using traditional linguistic methods. However, critiques of large language models include their ability to answer \"why\" questions and their relevance to real-life language acquisition. Some commenters argue that humans learn from the structure of the world, not just the structure of language, and that language models are cheating because they learned from us. Others point to examples of children raised in isolation who spontaneously develop language, indicating that language acquisition is an innate capability among humans.}\n\nðŸ”— https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=zykJTC4AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=zykJTC4AAAAJ:gnsKu8c89wgC\n\n#LLM #Language Model #AI",
