  "title": "Noam Chomsky Exposes the Real Limits of AI: Why Machines Can‚Äôt Understand Language Like Humans",
  "description": "Join Samuel Marusca in a fascinating discussion with world-renowned linguist and cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky, talking about the future of AI, language, mind, and consciousness. In this interview, Chomsky voices his skepticism about the current state of AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT, which he warns are not as capable as many believe. He unpacks the myths around general artificial intelligence and cautions against viewing machines as conscious or intelligent beings. Chomsky shares his deep skepticism about artificial intelligence, explaining why even a 2-year-old has more understanding and adaptability than the most advanced AI tools like ChatGPT. According to Chomsky, AI systems like ChatGPT don‚Äôt truly ‚Äúthink‚Äù or understand language; they only execute pre-programmed patterns and algorithms. \n\nHighlighting the risks of believing in AI as a solution for human problems, Chomsky explains why machine learning lacks the genuine insight or awareness that defines human thought. This thought-provoking conversation challenges common assumptions about AI‚Äôs capabilities and explores why machines remain tools‚Äîprograms running patterns, not entities capable of understanding or generating language in a truly meaningful way.\n\nüìç SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/@Practical.Wisdom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#NoamChomsky #AI #practicalwisdom #motivation  #ChatGPT #Language #FutureOfAI #CognitiveScience #ArtificialIntelligence",
