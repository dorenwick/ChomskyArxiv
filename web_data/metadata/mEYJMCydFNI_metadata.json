The consensus seems to be that dissent died with the ’60s. People today are too contented and too rich, or too poor and put upon to protest anything; we’ve become a nation of couch potatoes. But stop a minute and consider this: in 1988, at the height of the Reagan-Bush era, more than 500 students were arrested in campus political protests and over 3,000 people were arrested protesting against nuclear arms. In this program with Bill Moyers, Noam Chomsky shares his thoughts about the meaning of protest today. Chomsky believes in the blunt scrutiny of national power, arbitrary government, and injustice. He discusses the decline of political democracy, and his admiration for the common sense and creativity of ordinary people.",
