  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound/video quality. \n\nOn April 6, 2007, Noam Chomsky was interviewed in his office at MIT by journalists from Circa1 Media.  They discuss cases of self-immolation from the Vietnam and then ongoing 2nd Iraq War, among other matters.\n\n\nFor the video, I corrected the aspect ratio, which was far too narrow.\n\nI gave the sound a de-noising with digital noise reduction to eliminate a persistent hiss/hum than ran throughout the recording.  It came out sounding very clear, with a very low noise floor.\n\n\n\nThanks to @circa1media https://www.youtube.com/@circa1media/featured for the upload:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56OWdXTgS8U\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 2007, September 11, 9-11, 911, Anthrax Attacks, 1993 World Trade Center Bombing, anti-war movement, Vietnam War, John Kennedy, Iraq War, Arthur Schlesinger, Bernard Fall, Robert Fisk, Patrick Cockburn, Fallujah, Iran, Nicaragua, George III, Thomas Jefferson, Anthony Lewis, Tet Offensive, Norman R.
