  "title": "Tony Robbins Gives Noam Chomsky A Pep Talk",
  "description": "After more than 9 decades on the planet Earth, Noam Chomsky is feeling a tad pessimistic about the state of things. Climate change, the banning of books in Florida, and former President Donald Trump are only a few of the concerns which are contributing to his doom and gloom. \n\nNoam sits down with renowned motivational speaker Tony Robbins. For Tony, this is one of the most challenging pep talks he has ever given. He attempts to assuage Chomsky's doom by discussing the seasons of life and the seasons of history.",
