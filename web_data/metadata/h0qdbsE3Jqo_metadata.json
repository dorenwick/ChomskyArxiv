  "title": "Noam Chomsky: The Alien perspective on humanity - Jung & Naiv: Episode 284",
  "description": "Please support our work ► http://www.paypal.me/JungNaiv\n\nWe meet Noam (and his wife) in his office at MIT in Cambridge. Tilo asks Noam to pretend to be an alien for a moment. An alien who looks down on Earth. What does he witness? Chomsky explains what the objective observer from out of space would see: What is humanity up to in the 21st century? Will it be our final century? Are we going to survive? What existential dangers are we facing? What's the most dangerous organization in human history?\n\nTilo and \"Alien Chomsky\" also talk about the American Empire: Is it going to last? Is America the exception to the rule of Empires always falling? What about Obama's drone program? Is Obama a terrorist? Is Germany part of a terrorist organization? Is Martin Luther King still right about his government?\n\n\nThanks to more than a thousand supporters who helped produce this episode with Noam Chomsky!
