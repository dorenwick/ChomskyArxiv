  "description": "Chomsky's criticism of the education system which, according to him, often limits creativity and critical thinking. Chomsky believes that conventional education can lead students to accept information without questioning it or understanding it more deeply, resulting in enforced ignorance. This quote invites us to think more critically about the way we learn and educate future generations, and the importance of developing independent and critical thinking.",
