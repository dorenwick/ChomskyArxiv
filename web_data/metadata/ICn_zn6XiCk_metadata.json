  "title": "Chomsky's Critique of Soviet Socialism | #chomsky #speech #socialism",
  "description": "In this video, Noam Chomsky shares his insights on the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and argues that it was actually a counter-revolution that led to an authoritarian, anti-socialist regime. He discusses how the new regime dismantled workers' control and participation, despite its claims to be socialist and democratic. Chomsky's critique sheds light on the implications of the Soviet experiment for socialism and democracy worldwide.",
