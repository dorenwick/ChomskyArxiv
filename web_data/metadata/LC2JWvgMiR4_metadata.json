  "title": "Noam Chomsky - 1998-03-20 - Universal Linguistics and the Nature of Language - Improved Sound",
  "description": "Be sure to pick at least 720p for best sound quality. Noam begins speaking at 3:07 in.\nOn March 20, 1998, Noam Chomsky spoke at Winona State University in Minnesota on the topic: Universal Linguistics and the Nature of Language.  The Q&A is particularly good. \n\n\n\nThe source video had two very different sounding channels - one side, a direct mic feed, and the other sounding like it was out in the audience.  I used the direct mic feed side to make a mono track, after giving it a stiff de-noising to remove persistent hiss/hum, and going over the program, second by second to eliminate or reduce every errant noise I could - well over a hundred of them - to make it safe for headphone users.\n\n\nThanks to @ThePublicMindDenver for the original upload:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sw15-vSY8E\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1998, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, Joseph Priestly, Thomas Hobbes,  Ghost in the Machine, Mind/Body Problem, John Locke, Physics, Chemistry, Music, Mathematics,",
