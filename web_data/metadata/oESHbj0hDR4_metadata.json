  "description": "This video is part of the debate playlist, where we analyze popular discussions. The goal is both to refine and distill the, sometimes quite long, debates we look at and also to critically review their contents. In particular, we focus on how arguments are created and how they can be logically contested, important skills to have for the proper functioning of our society.\n\nNoam Chomsky- linguist, and political activist- and Sam Harris- neuroscientist and author - discuss America's foreign interventions and the role of intentions in deciding the morality of actions.\n\nlink to the entire debate: https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-limits-of-discourse\n\nUlterior comments:\n\n1) Another thing that probably would have helped clarify the debate early on was explicitly distinguishing between the morality of actions and the morality of actors:\n\"The motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent\" and Utilitarians are \"aware that a right action does not necessarily indicate a virtuous character, and that actions which are blamable, often proceed from qualities entitled to praise. When this is apparent in any particular case, it modifies their estimation, not certainly of the act, but of the agent.\" Jhon Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism.\nImmoral actions can be committed by well-intentioned agents, this is the reason why, if one wanted to find a difference between terrorism and America's foreign interventions, it may be easier to find it looking at the consequences of their actions and where they lead us.",
