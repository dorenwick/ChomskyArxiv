He is a pioneer in the fields of linguistics and cognitive science. He has deep thoughts about communicating with aliens, meditation, Elon Musk, and free speech.\n\nChomsky is a prolific author and known political activist. We avoided politics, as is the custom for my interviews. Our conversation also covers the Turing Test, neural nets, and artificial intelligence, including why he expects Elon Musk’s Neuralink project to fail. \n—\nKey Takeaways:\n00:00:00  Introduction\n00:09:10  Does Noam Chomsky believe in extraterrestrial life & could we communicate with E.T.?\n00:24:20  Busting (or confirming) linguistic myths with the master.\n00:39:00  “There is no scientific method. It’s just being intelligent.”\n00:58:00  Artificial intelligence applications in cognitive science.\n01:09:15  Chomsky University would encourage discovery. \n01:21:44  Thoughts on the negative reaction to the Harper’s Magazine article.\n01:29:40  What object or knowledge would Chomsky put in or on his monolith? \n01:32:09  What did Chomsky think was impossible until he did it?\n\n—\n\nNoam Chomsky has been called \"the father of modern linguistics.\" He has been a professor at MIT since 1955 (now emeritus) and continues to teach at the University of Arizona at the age of 91. Chomsky has received numerous awards and honorary doctorates, along with being a member of multiple professional societies. He has written over 100 books covering topics including linguistics, politics, and philosophy. \n\nRead “A Letter on Justice and Open Debate,” the letter in Harper’s Magazine which Chomsky signed https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\n\nFind Chomsky on the web: https://chomsky.info and Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Noam-Chomsky-294468630182/\n\n—\n\n🎤 Join me and ⁦Lawrence Krauss for an Onstage Dialogue ⁦at the San Diego Air & Space Museum Tuesday, Oct 17, 2023 at 7:00 PM: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/live-onstage-dialogue-brian-keating-lawrence-m-krauss-tickets-699430514497\n\nWatch my most popular videos:\nEric Weinstein: https://youtu.be/YjsPb3kBGnk?sub_confirmation=1 \nJim Simons: https://youtu.be/6fr8XOtbPqM?sub_confirmation=1 \nNoam Chomsky: https://youtu.be/Iaz6JIxDh6Y?sub_confirmation=1 \nSabine Hossenfelder: https://youtu.be/V6dMM2-X6nk?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n🏄‍♂️ Find me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DrBrianKeating \n🔥 Find me on Instagram at https://instagram.com/DrBrianKeating\n📖 Buy my book LOSING THE NOBEL PRIZE: http://amzn.to/2sa5UpA \n🔔 Subscribe for more great content https://www.youtube.com/DrBrianKeating?sub_confirmation=1\n✍️Detailed Blog posts here: https://briankeating.com/blog.php\n📧Join my mailing list: http://briankeating.com/mailing_list.php\n👪Join my Facebook Group: https://facebook.com/losingthenobelprize\n🎙️Please subscribe, rate, and review the INTO THE IMPOSSIBLE Podcast on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/into-the-impossible/id1169885840?mt=2\n\nA production of http://imagination.ucsd.edu/\n\n#NoamChomsky #AI #Aliens\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Neil DeGrasse Tyson: Plays the Race Card!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs4QCSe05I4\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",
