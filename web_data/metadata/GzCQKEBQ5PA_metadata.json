  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and video quality.\nOn April 20, 2006, Noam Chomsky spoke at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, on the topic \"Just War Theory.\"\n\n\nThe source had poor audio quality with severe clipping, especially at high frequencies.  I de-noised it, removing a persistent hiss that ran throughout the talk, but found to tame the clipping required rolling off a great deal of the treble.  Hopefully a better master will emerge of this event.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 2006, Just War Theory, Hugo Grotius, Jean-Jacques Rousseau,  Michael Walzer, Afghanistan, Serbia, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, 1967 War, David Hume, Marc Hauser, Daniel Webster, Justice Robert Jackson, Tacitus, John Adams, Iran, Iraq, George Bush, Saddam, Gulf War, Kuwait,",
