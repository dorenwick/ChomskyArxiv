  "title": "1992 Killian Lecture - Noam Chomsky, \"Language and the ‘Cognitive Revolution’\"",
  "description": "Professor Noam Chomsky delivers the 20th Annual James R. Killian, Jr. Faculty Achievement Award and Lecture titled \"Language and the ‘Cognitive Revolution’” (April 8, 1992). Renowned as the father of modern linguistics, Chomsky begins by explaining his skepticism regarding the so-called ‘cognitive revolution,’ and clarifies his reasoning in a methodical survey of the evolution of linguistics. He illustrates his investigations into what he terms an innate language faculty, and shares his strategies in approaching a unified theory of language. Chomsky’s highly rational and occasionally humorous exposition concludes with an affirmation about the surprising beauty and mystery of language. Chomsky is introduced by Prof. Kim Vandiver, chairman of the faculty, who describes the Killian award as the highest award that the MIT faculty bestows upon one of its own.  Named after MIT’s 10th president, the award was established in 1971 to recognize extraordinary professional accomplishments by full-time members of the MIT faculty.",
