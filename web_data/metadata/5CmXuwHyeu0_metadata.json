  "title": "Noam Chomsky - 1990-09-11 - Interview on Iraq-Kuwait Crisis - The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour",
  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound quality.\nOn September 11, 1990, Noam Chomsky made his one and only appearance on the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, which was broadcast nightly on American Public Broadcasting. \n\n\n\nAs I learned recently, soon after the media watchdog group, FAIR, published a study of guests on news programs, like MacNeil/Lehrer - in which they exposed them as having a recurring group of \"experts\" on air on a regular basis - they apparently caved to the public outraged and finally allowed Noam Chomsky on.  \n\nDe-noised to sound better than the original broadcast. \n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1990, Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, United Nations, George H.W. Bush, Iraq War, Desert Shield, Desert Storm,",
