  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and picture quality.\nOn April 20, 1993, Noam Chomsky was on an interview program with Phil Donahue and Vladimir Pozner.\n\nNear the end of the interview, Donahue mentions that he will have Chomsky back for a second show. Apparently, Chomsky did return, but is a recording of this available? If you know, please leave a comment. \n\n\n\nI did a pretty thorough de-noising of the program, but couldn't do much for the video.  Alas, because the person who grabbed a copy with his video tape machine didn't let up on the pause button in time after some of the commercial breaks, there are a few bits missing.  Let's all hope a better copy emerges.\n\n\n\nNoam Chomsky, Donahue, Clinton, Serbia, Kosovo, Croatia, NAFTA, USSR, Bosnia, East Timor, Cambodia, 1993, Yugoslavia, Hitler,",
