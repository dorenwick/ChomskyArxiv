  "description": "While on a visit to Dublin in early 2006 Noam Chomsky held a private meeting for the anarchist group Workers Solidarity Movement and friends they invited in the Teachers Club, Parnell Square.  The meeting was based on Chomsky answering questions from the floor, this is the video of the meeting,  You can find out more about the WSM at www.wsm.ie.\n\nThe sound quality of this recording is poor so we recommend you turn on captions, we are in the process of captioning the entire video, for now you can look forward to the bit where our captioning ends and the hilarious Youtube auto-captioning starts.",
