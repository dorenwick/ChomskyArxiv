  "description": "\"If the Spartacist League cared about working people, poor people, people elsewhere in the world who suffer and so on, they would care about the large outcomes that follow from those small differences. If you don't care about what happens to those people and you want to live in some abstract seminar somewhere, then you don't care. But it's a fact, and we can't deny it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 4/29/04 talk at MIT regarding John Negroponte's appointment to the Iraq Embassy.",
