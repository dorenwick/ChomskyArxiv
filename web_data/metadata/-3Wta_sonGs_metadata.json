  "description": "Noam Chomsky is a highly influential American linguist, philosopher and political activist. He is professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is considered by many to be the father of modern linguistics. He has also become known as an influential political activist and critic of US foreign policy as well as that of other countries. In addition to this, he is a key figure in contemporary philosophy as well as being a prolific writer.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",
