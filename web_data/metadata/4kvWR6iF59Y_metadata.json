  "description": "Be sure to pick at least 720p for best sound quality.\nOn December 5, 1973, Noam Chomsky debated Alan Dershowitz on the subject \"A Lasting Peace in the Middle East.\"  This debate comes shortly after the Israeli-Arab war of 1973, and the fallout: the Arab states cutting back on oil production, leading, in part, toward the stagflation economy of the 1970's and early '80s. \n\n\n\nDe-noised, speed corrected, and lightly EQed by yours as ever truly, for your listening pleasure.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1973, Alan Dershowitz, Zionism, Balfour Declaration, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Israel, Palestine, settlements, Jewish National Fund, Menachem Begin, Moshe Dayan, Golan Heights, Gaza, West Bank, Anwar Sadat, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan River, David Ben-Gurion",
