  "title": "David Barsamian interviews Noam Chomsky on the Consequences of Capitalism. Recorded March 15, 2021.",
  "description": "The consequences of capitalism during the pandemic have revealed glaring failures and monstrous brutalities. It’s a highly unstable economic system, careening from crisis to crisis. For a handful, it produces unparalleled levels of wealth. But for the many, if they even have a job, it’s a paycheck to paycheck existence. What are the priorities? The U.S. spends close to a trillion on the military. That’s more than the next ten countries combined. Compare that with the less than $50 billion allotted to the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. With robust funding it’s very likely we would have been better prepared for the pandemic and would not be the world leader in deaths. The future? We will move toward a more humane and decent society or continue on our present destructive path.\n------------------------------------------------------\n﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Alternative Radio provides information, analyses and views that are frequently ignored or distorted in other media.
