  "description": "Noam Chomsky on the continuing violence in the Kurdistan region.  Turkish military strikes PKK in northern Iraq, kills 24 militants. Turkish warplanes struck Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq and killed 24 PKK fighters in southeast Turkey on Thursday, the army said, as the militants launched a car bomb attack on a military installation in the region. Thursday night's bombing killed three security force members and wounded 24 at a security outpost near the southeast's largest city of Diyarbakir, the military said in a separate statement on Friday, confirming a report from security sources.\n\nA Reuters witness said the installation suffered severe damage in the blast on the highway between Diyarbakir and the town of Lice. Security forces imposed tight security in the area and erected screens to conceal the site.\n\nThe PKK claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on one of its websites. It said 28 soldiers were killed and 32 were wounded in the attack. The army and PKK generally give vastly different death tolls for attacks and clashes. The figures could not be verified.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday 300 members of the security forces had been killed since the conflict flared up last year, triggering the heaviest clashes since the 1990s. Erdogan said the PKK losses were at least 10 times as high. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-kurds-idUSKCN0WR0ZG",
