  "description": "Christopher Hitchens and Noam Chomsky interview\n\nChristopher Hitchens FBI file: http://www.scribd.com/doc/84416634/Christopher-Hitchens-FBI-File\n\nA request under the Freedom of Information Act has led to the release of a 19-page file (found here) composed by the FBI since 1970 on late journalist Christopher Hitchens. The request was submitted by the owner of the HistoryAnarchy blog, and reveals that the young Hitchens caused a stir when embarking on a tour of American university campuses in 1970. His case number begins with the number 105, which in FBI classification indicates it involved foreign counterintelligence.\n\nIn Hitchens's autobiography Hitch-22,  the writer and journalist recalls how his time at Oxford often involved \"getting arrested while wearing jeans and donkey jacket and carrying some insurgent flag\" as he joined the picket lines at non-union factories, protested the war in Vietnam and blockaded hairdressers supporting racial segregation. These actions, coupled with his early socialist affiliations, led to the report mentioning that he \"was a member of the International Socialism Group of Trotskyists\" and the \"Oxford Revolutionary Socialist Students\". It's hard to come up with names that could have intimidated the Nixon regime any more at the time (or the \"Nixon gang\" as Hitchens later went on to name it).\nhttp://www.wessexscene.co.uk/news/2012/03/22/christopher-hitchenss-fbi-file-is-released/",
