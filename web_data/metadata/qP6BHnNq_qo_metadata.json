  "description": "Professor Noam Chomsky has been a subject of great acclaim during his lengthy career. Once referred to by Paul Robinson of the New York Times Book Review as “possibly our greatest intellectual alive,” Mr. Chomsky is best known for his contributions as a linguist, writer, and political activist. As the author of over 100 books and countless columns and essays, Mr. Chomsky’s writings have focused largely on the politics of power and what we as individuals can do to bring about social change. On March 8th, 2013, THINK Global School had the opportunity to have a question and answer session with Professor Chomsky, where he fielded questions pertaining to his perspectives on war, politics, and mass media.\nCreated with http://tovid.io",
