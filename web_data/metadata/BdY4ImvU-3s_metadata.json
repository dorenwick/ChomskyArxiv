  "title": "\"Evil doesn’t begin to approach it\" - Noam Chomsky speaks live on the Climate Crisis and Resistance",
  "description": "\"I don't know what word in the language—I can’t find one—that applies to people of that kind, who are willing to sacrifice the existence of organized human life, not in the distant future, so they can put a few more dollars in highly overstuffed pockets. The word “evil” doesn’t begin to approach it.\" - Noam Chomsky\n\nProfessor Noam Chomsky needs no introduction, he is arguably the world’s leading public intellectual. The Climate Crisis needs no introduction, it is unarguably the greatest act of injustice in human history. Noam will talk about resistance because the time for talking is over.\n\nThe world's top climate scientist, James Hanson, former head of NASA, recently said the idea of staying under 1.5C is “unadulterated bullshit”. Britain’s former top government science advisor, Sir David King has said “We have to act quickly. What we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity”. That’s polite elite speak for billions of people will die of starvation so that the rich can keep their power. \n\nShare this historic event in your networks.\n\nDonate here: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/just-stop-oil\n\n🎦 Join the Nightly National Zoom Session: https://juststopoil.org/zoom \n\n📺 Watch a video talk about the campaign by Adam McKay, director of Don’t Look Up: https://youtu.be/VujjaBclK4U \n\n🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏻 Attend a talk online or in person: https://juststopoil.org/events/ \n\n✍🏻 Sign up to step up with us in April: https://juststopoil.org/sign-up/ \n\nCOP26 has failed: there are no meaningful commitments to halt fossil fuel production, our future now a reckless gamble. \n\nCarry on emitting today and hope at some future date huge carbon sucking technology will solve the problem. Yet we know carbon is killing today, and global emissions are still rising. \n\nOil is more valuable than our culture, our heritage, our bodies. More valuable than the beautiful web of life on earth, more valuable than home.\n\n#juststopoil\n#climatecrisis\n#globalwarming",
