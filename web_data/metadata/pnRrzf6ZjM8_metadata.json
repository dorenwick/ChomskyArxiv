  "description": "#NoamChomsky #JonathanKozol\nNoam Chomsky & Jonathan Kozol in Conversation: Education, Inequality, and the Decline of the \"Public Good\"\nModerated by Cindy Cruz, Associate Professor\n\nWhat happens to public education when our society no longer cares about the common good? Join Noam Chomsky and Jonathan Kozol, both long-time activists for social justice, for a conversation about education, inequality, and the decline of the “public good.” \n\nIn America today, the school experience is blatantly unequal and our schools are more segregated than they have been since 1968. What does this mean for the future of our students and socially just society? Chomsky and Kozol will examine the current decline and where we go from here. \n\nThis virtual University of Arizona event is presented by the College of Education’s Education Policy Center and the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences.",
