  "description": "'\"Philosophers: Debates and Dialogues\"\nA series by Fons Elders\nhttp://www.icarusfilms.com/new2012/philo.html\n\nNoam Chomsky and Michel Foucault \nHuman Nature - Justice Versus Power\n\n Part one of PHILOSOPHERS: DEBATES AND DIALOGUES documents the now-legendary 1971 debate between two very different heroes of the intellectual Left: linguist and activist Noam Chomsky, and cultural theorist and historian of ideas Michel Foucault.\n\nBrought together to discuss their divergent views on the concept of human nature, these two heavyweights trace arguments that resonant well into 21st century politics and thought. At the time, both thinkers were not only heroes within academia, but within the burgeoning counterculture as well, making this meeting one of the most important intellectual events of the early 1970s.\n\nhttp://icarusfilms.com/new2012/ph_cf.html",
