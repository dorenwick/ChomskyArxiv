  "description": "This video is made on Noam Chomsky’s comment on structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination and how they must be handled in order to increase the scope of human freedom. \n\n“I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a justification for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom. ~ Noam Chomsky”\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/So-Political-106174721856979 \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sopoliticall/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SoPoliticall \nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/sopolitical/_saved/",
