  "description": "This conversation is part of the 'Understanding Noam Chomsky' Series ('Dare to know!' Philosophy Podcast). Today we are joined by Noam Chomsky. Noam Chomsky has been called “the father of modern linguistics” and is one of the most cited scholars in modern history. \n\nChomsky has been a professor at MIT since 1955 (now Emeritus) and continues to teach at the University of Arizona at the age of 92. He has written over 100 books covering topics including linguistics, politics, and philosophy. Chomsky has not only transformed the field of linguistics, but his work also influenced fields such as cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, computer science, mathematics, childhood education, and anthropology.\n\nIn today’s discussion, we cover topics including Enlightenment, Creativity, Romantic Rationalism, the Science Forming Faculty, Beauty & much more. \n\nPODCAST CHANNELS: \nITunes/Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/nl/podcast/dare-to-know-philosophy-podcast/id1508888549\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5IaosTbUJoULAKeDk2eNk0?si=4_eCcYcWQN2mZXE1WOwRTw\n\nGUEST INFO:\nhttps://chomsky.info/\n\nHOST INFO:\nFabian Corver is the Host & Producer of the Dare to Know!
