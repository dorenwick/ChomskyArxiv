  "description": "Renowned political theorist Noam Chomsky is often cited for his criticism of the US political system.\n\nIn the second of a special two-part interview, Chomsky sits down with Mehdi Hasan to discuss the US presidential election and the rise of Islamophobia. \n\nThe US academic says Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has the \"best policies\", but little chance of winning in a \"mainly bought\" election.\n\nWhen asked if he would vote for presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton if he lived in a swing state, Chomsky says: \"Oh absolutely... my vote would be against the Republican candidate.\"\n\nMore from UpFront on:\nYouTube - http://aje.io/UpFrontYT\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/ajUpFront\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/ajUpFront\nWebsite - http://aljazeera.com/upfront",
