  "title": "Celebrating the Legacy of Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle: The Founding Fathers of MIT Linguistics",
  "description": "The MIT Department of Linguistics has dedicated a wing of its Stata Center home to founding fathers Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle. The department head, Danny Fox, says that Chomsky and Halle \"defined and transformed the entire field of linguistics.\" Chomsky delivered a virtual lecture titled “Genuine Explanation and the Strong Minimalist Thesis” that was made available to the entire MIT community.  \n\nAfter the lecture (see the link below), Chomsky, faculty, alumni, and graduate students had a lively discussion and reception. Chomsky and Halle defined human language acquisition as a biologically based trait and Chomsky specialized in syntax, while Halle specialized in phonology. Their works had a great impact on the field of linguistics and their legacy continues to shape the discipline today.\n\nA link to the lecture:\nhttps://youtu.be/SJSz-7JSP4c\n\nOther lectures of Noam Chomsky at MIT:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r514RhgISv0&list=PLYkXQ_OujDRajdQfKnsOPt20Mae7HvR5n",
