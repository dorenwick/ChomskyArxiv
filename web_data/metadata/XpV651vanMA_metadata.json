  "title": "What Does The Bible Say About Palestine? Noam Chomsky #israel #palestine",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky in a recent interview on the biblical claim to Palestine and the legality of occupation and settlements. \n\nNoam Chomsky challenges the use of biblical rights as a justification for Israeli claims to the land, stating that they hold no validity in the modern world and that Palestinians have a stronger genetic connection to the ancient population of the region. Chomsky then shifts the focus to international law, arguing that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under the UN, World Court, and Israeli legal experts. He emphasizes that Israel's expansion into the West Bank, considered part of \"greater Israel,\" is recognized as an occupation by all relevant international institutions, making Israel the occupying authority in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\n\n#israelpalestineconflict #bible #westbank #gaza #UN \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks and also support our organisation:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz4AXmFeSbi-0vPXI102Q5w/join\n\nTo learn more about our projects\nhttps://muslimcentral.com\n-----------------\nFor more information, please read our Social Media Disclaimer.\nhttps://help.muslimcentral.com/docs/disclaimer-social-media",
