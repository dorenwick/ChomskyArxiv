  "title": "Noam Chomsky - 1988-11-XX - Interviewed by Canadian Journalists at Round Table - Improved audio.",
  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and picture quality.\nAfter delivering his lecture series, \"Necessary Illusions - Thought Control in Democratic Societies\" on Canadian radio, Noam Chomsky took questions from the Canadian press, including a young David Frum. \n\n\n\nThanks to Digital Chomsky for uploading the original video. \n\n\n\nI did a VERY extensive fixing and cleanup of the audio.  The left/right tracks were out of phase with each other, making the sound muffled.  I fixed that.  Also I did a pretty thorough de-noising, and fixed other small problems - like quieting sudden explosive sounds, making this safe for headphone users - for example at 22:30 - which on the original audio mastering was insanely loud(!). \n\n\n\nI color-corrected the video somewhat and improved the contrast, as well.  Unfortunately, the poor quality of the source limited what could be done.\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1988, Noam Chomsky, Vietnam, Media, David Frum, USSR, Nuclear Weapons, Test Ban, SDI, United Nations, Journalism, sports, Kurds, Propaganda Model, Burundi, Libya, racism, Israel, Palestine, Star Wars, Ronald Reagan,",
