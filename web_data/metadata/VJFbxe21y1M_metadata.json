  "title": "In Conversation with Noam Chomsky: Political Philosophy, Psychoanalysis and Linguistics",
  "description": "Hamza Naseer talks with Noam Chomsky on political philosophy in Pakistan: how to bring an anarchist approach into political activism, how to promote secularism, and the role of educational institutes. \n\nIn the later part of the interview, Hamza discusses Aurat March (March for Women Rights) and the feasibility of their demands; in particular the demands related to not taking loans from IMF. \n\nFinally, there's discussion on psychoanalysis, and then on linguistics where he describes his minority position: of language having developed for clarification of thought rather than communication and his views on B.F. Skinner. \n\nHope you enjoy this informative talk.\n\n#NoamChomsky",
