  "title": "Noam Chomsky on Disconnect of \"Left Intellectuals\" from Working People (1/8)",
  "description": "Chomsky talks about the core issues for a workers' movement, and the disconnect between \"Left Intellectuals\" and the working class. He reviews the old tradition of working class culture and the destruction of it, and the tendency of \"Left Intellectuals\" to focus on \"Post-Materialist issues\" while ignoring fundamental problems that confront working people. The interview was conducted in Leiden, the Netherlands, in March 2011. \r\n\r\nView the whole interview: http://youtu.be/ODtqoottyRY",
