  "description": "Aria Razfar and Noam Chomsky discuss the influence of William Chomsky, Noam's father, on Noam's linguistic work. William Chomsky was a scholar of the Hebrew language, including Hebrew mysticism. Noam also talked about the prevailing theory in linguistics when he was in college, Saussurean linguistics and contrasted it with what he encountered in his father's work. In addition, they discussed Noam's undergraduate thesis, which revolved around Hebrew.",
