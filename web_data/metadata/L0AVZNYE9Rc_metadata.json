Herman and Noam Chomsky ðŸ‘‰ https://amzn.to/3YXdlhB\nðŸ“– The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein ðŸ‘‰ https://amzn.to/4dEcLtR\nðŸ“– The Common Good by Noam Chomsky ðŸ‘‰ https://amzn.to/4dFfAdY\n\nControversial linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky challenges our core beliefs about freedom, democracy, and capitalism.   He argues that corporations and media manipulate us,  wars are waged for profit, and the economic system is rigged for the wealthy.  His 'Manufacturing Consent' theory reveals how news shapes public opinion to uphold the status quo. Are we truly free if our choices are controlled by those with power? This episode explores Chomsky's radical critique of modern society.\n\n#philosophy #motivation #life #selfimprovement #selfawareness #growth #NoamChomsky #capitalism #media #consent #propaganda #democracy #power #control #inequality #exploitation #freedom #politics #elections #economy #society #corporations #manipulation #truth #illusion #awareness #criticalsthinking #activism #change",
