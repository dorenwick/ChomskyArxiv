  "title": "DEBATE: Israel-Palestine w/ Noam Chomsky & Rudy Rochman",
  "description": "On one side, Rudy Rochman, a young and inspiring activist who uses his growing platform to generate innovative ways to combat anti-Semitism. Rudy is dedicated to fighting antisemitism around the world and strengthening Jewsâ€™ connection to the land of Israel.\n\nOn the other side, Noam Chomsky, a world-renowned intellectual and activist for over 60 years. He has written over 150 books, has multiple arrest records, and is widely known for being a fierce critic of Israel. \n\nBridging the gap between different eras of activists for a vibrant discussion on the Israel-Palestine conflict, this debate is sure to be one for the ages.\n\nTopics of discussion...\nZionism as an indigenous rights movement\nExploring the federation solution\nEffective activism through the ages\n\nPinned by Suger star\n@jesstv3029\n3 years ago\n6:10 - 7:25 Rudy [75 seconds]\n7:36 - 10:15 Chomsky [159 seconds]\n10:32 - 13:09 Rudy [157 seconds]\n13:09 - 17:37 Chomsky [268 seconds]\n17:38 - 23:14 Rudy [336 seconds]\n23:14 - 29:40 Chomsky [386 seconds]\n29:40 - 39:52 Rudy [612 seconds]\n39:52 - 50:19 Chomsky [627 seconds]\n\n52:46 - 55:39 Chomsky (Specific question aimed at chomsky)  [173 seconds]\n55:40 - 1:00:00 Rudy (interrupted by host) [260 seconds]\n10:00:16 - 1:00:24 Chomsky (interrupted by Rudy) [8 seconds]\n1:00:24 - 1:00:29 Rudy (interrupted by Chomsky) [5 seconds]\n1:00:30 - 1:00:42 Chaos [12 seconds]\n1:00:42 - 1:00:57 Chomsky (interrupted by Rudy) [15 seconds]\n1:00:57 - 1:01:06  Chaos [9 seconds]\n1:01:06 - 1:02:53 Chomsky [107 seconds]\n1:02:54 - 1:03:38 Rudy (interrupted by Chomsky) [44 seconds]\n1:03:38 - 1:03:42 chaos [4 seconds]\n1:03:42 - 1:10:30 Rudy[ 408 seconds]\n1:10:30 - 1:13:33 Chomsky [183 seconds]\n\n1:13:35 - 1:14:06  Host tries to ask Chomsky question 31\n1:14:06 - 1:15:16 Rudy (brings up grievances) 70\n1:15:17 - 1:15:20 Chomsky (has to go soon) 3\n1:15:20 - 1:16:49 Chomsky (last point) 89\n\nChomsky leaves\n\nFINAL TALLY: \nRudy: spoke for 1967 seconds\nChomsky: spoke for 2018 seconds \nChomsky spoke 51 seconds longer than Rudy\nRudy interrupted Chomsky 2x\nChomsky interrupted Rudy 2x\n\nThe first time Rudy was interrupted was actually by the host. When Chomsky tried to continue after that Rudy was the first debater to interrupt the other debater. It turned into chaos after that because both debaters had been interrupted and wanted to finish making their points. \nAlthough Rudy is correct in that Chomsky spoke longer (51 seconds) than Rudy, he exaggerates a bit how much longer Chomsky spoke. Especially considering that the host had specific questions for Chomsky. If you ask one person more questions it's unsurprising they speak longer. \nTo me it did feel like Rudy spoke longer because he spoke faster and said a lot more.",
