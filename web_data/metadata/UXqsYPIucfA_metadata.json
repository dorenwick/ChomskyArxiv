  "description": "Noam Chomsky visited Spain in 1992. He gave a seminar at the University of Girona, as well as two conferences in Barcelona, at the invitation of the Ferrater Mora Chair of Contemporary Thought.\n\nThis is one of the conferences, where he gave a talk, before answering some questions from the audience.\nThis was originally uploaded to various places on the Internet, notably by@riccardo9383 and @monaringel255 on YouTube.\n\nThe original videographer and publisher is not known. Feel free to tell me their name(s) for attribution purposes.\n\nThe original footage has received the following modifications:\n- AI quality enhancement\n- The host's introductory speech has been edited short for easier viewing, and the portion that was kept was translated.\n- Audience questions have been translated (with the help of a native Catalan/Spanish speaker) and put on the screen while Noam Chomsky listens to the interpreter's translation on his earpiece.",
