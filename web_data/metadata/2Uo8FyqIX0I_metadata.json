  "description": "(Re-upload, originally released 3/23, thought I was doing this on the Clips channel but apparently I'm an idiot)\n\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/3v8OhY7\n\nNoam Chomsky is Professor of Linguistics Emeritus at MIT and Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. He not only counts as among the most influential linguists of all time, but he has played a major role in the development of twentieth and twenty-first century philosophy, cognitive science, and political theory. Noam and Robinson talk about some of the major topics in modern linguistics, ranging from generative and universal grammar to innateness hypotheses and the current limitations of large language models for studying human linguistic faculties. There are also philosophical dimensions to the conversation, as Noam touches on his time with Nelson Goodman, Hilary Putnam, and W. V. O. Quine, while other concerns—such as the indeterminacy of reference and the relationship between thought and language—recur throughout the discussion. \n \nOUTLINE:\n00:00 In This Episode…\n00:27 Introduction\n8:32 Noam’s Entry into Linguistics \n11:03 Ferdinand de Saussure and Twentieth Century Linguistics\n23:04 The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis\n26:00 Thoughts on Language and Behaviorism\n35:24 Innateness Hypotheses in Linguistics\n42:00 Innateness and Universal Grammar\n46:02 Limitations of Large Language Models\n48:42 Impossible Languages and What Linguists Study\n1:00:10 Historical Shifts in Linguistics\n\nRobinson’s Website: ⁠http://robinsonerhardt.com⁠\n\nRobinson Erhardt researches symbolic logic and the foundations of mathematics at Stanford University.
