  "title": "Noam Chomsky: Science, Philosophy, Morality, & Anarchism (INTERVIEW)",
  "description": "This conversation is part of the 'Understanding Noam Chomsky' Series ('Dare to know!' Philosophy Podcast). Today we are joined by Noam Chomsky. Noam Chomsky  has been called \"the father of modern linguistics” and is one of the most cited scholars in modern history. He has been a professor at MIT since 1955 (now Emeritus) and continues to teach at the University of Arizona at the age of 91. He has written over 100 books covering topics including linguistics, politics, and philosophy. \n\nToday, I discuss with him issues ranging from science, the history of science, philosophy of mind, to moral/political philosophy and law. This episode is part of a larger series called ‘Understanding Noam Chomsky’ on this channel.
