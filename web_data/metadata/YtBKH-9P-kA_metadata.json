  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and picture quality.\nOn October 5, 1971, Noam Chomsky appeared on a public television program called \"The Advocate\" taking part in the debate about whether Daniel Ellsberg, should be punished for releasing the infamous Pentagon Papers to the public.\n\n\nChomsky was certainly always supportive of Dan Ellsberg, as demonstrated by the fact that he (along with Howard Zinn) edited the Pentagon Papers for publication. \n\n\n\nI removed a persistent hiss from the program for your listening pleasure.\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nDaniel Ellsberg, Vietnam War, Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, whistleblowers, the draft,",
