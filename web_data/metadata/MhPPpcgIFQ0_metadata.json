  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and picture quality.\nOn or about May 23, 1989, Noam Chomsky appeared on Dutch Television for an extended interview.  This is the 2nd half.  The first half, due to extreme sound problems, is not yet ready for release, but I am working on de-noising it.  Thus far, my attempts have gotten it noise free, but the clarity of the voices suffers to an unacceptable degree.\n\n\n\nThis video is raw footage from one of several cameras.  As such, there are short gaps in the interview, and seemingly odd camera angles, etc.\n\n\nFor the audio, I de-noised it to remove a persistent hiss that ran throughout the entire program.  I also muted or reduced several audio flubs and random noises, especially near the end.  For the video, I gave it a slight color adjustment. \n\n\n\nThanks to digitalchomsky for the original upload.\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1989, East Timor, Indonesia, Burundi, Australia, Iran-Contra Affair, Reagan, Watergate, Nicaragua, Israel, Vietnam War, Native Americans, JFK, John Kennedy, Robert Faurisson, Salman Rushdie, Walt Rostow, Henry Kissinger, Academic Freedom, Freedom of Speech,",
