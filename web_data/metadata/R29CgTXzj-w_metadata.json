  "description": "On 10 October 2011 Noam Chomsky launched the International State Crime Initiative's (ISCI) new journal, State Crime, at King's College London.\n\nNoam Chomsky is a US political theorist and activist, and Institute Professor of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Besides his work in linguistics, Chomsky is internationally recognized as one of the most critically engaged public intellectuals alive today. Chomsky continues to be an unapologetic critic of both American foreign policy and what he views as its ambitions for geopolitical hegemony and the neoliberal turn of global capitalism, which he identifies in terms of class warfare waged from above against the needs and interests of the great majority.",
