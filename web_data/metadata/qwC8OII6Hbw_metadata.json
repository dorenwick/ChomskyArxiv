  "title": "Noam Chomsky - 1992-11-2X - On Linguistics - Interviewed in Barcelona -  Improved Sound",
  "description": "Be sure to pick at least 720p for best sound quality.\nSometime, during his visit to Catalonia in 1992, Noam Chomsky was interviewed at Hotel Colon in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n\nI gave the audio an extensive restoration, digital noise reduction, and going over it second by second to reduce or eliminate all the major audio problems - mostly loud coughs - that I could.  There's some transient distortion, possibly from damage to the video tape.  All in all, it turned out very nicely.  \n\n\n\nThe source video was a low bitrate, 360p multi-gen copy, alas.  If you know of a better, please leave a comment to that effect.\n\n\n\nThanks to Danielle Whitis @daniellewhitis1732 for the upload: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-guF4XVqL8\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1993, Barcalona, Innate Structure, Plato, René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Cartesian Rationalism, David Hume, Down's Syndrome, Isaac Newton, Mind/Body problem, Artificial Intelligence, Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Language, Linguistics, Prescriptive Grammer,",
