  "title": "Chomsky missing the point on Israel-Palestine. Ronnie Barkan comments on politics vs. rights",
  "description": "Ronnie Barkan responds to a question about Prof. Chomsky and activism for Palestinian rights.\nWith Majed Abusalama in Prague, 4 June, 2014.\n...\n\"With all my great respect to Prof. Chomsky, I think that he tends to gloss over the main point. And the main point is that Israel is a supremacist state.\nThere is nothing legitimate about Zionism. Not in the Zionist project as it was implemented in Palestine.\nMaybe something about the Zionist ideology a long time ago, something about it was legitimate, maybe. Nothing was legitimate about the way it was implemented in Palestine.\"",
