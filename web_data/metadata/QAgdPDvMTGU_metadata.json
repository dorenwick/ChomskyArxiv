  "description": "www.psychexamreview.com\r\nIn this video I introduce language acquisition as a type of learning that isn't explained well by the behaviorist principles we saw in the unit on learning theory. In the next few videos we'll be looking at linguistics and language acquisition in more detail and then considering how language relates to thought. We begin with Noam Chomsky's review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior, which revealed the limits of the behaviorist approach. Next I introduce Chomsky's idea of a Language Acquisition Device that enables humans to learn language almost automatically when exposed to it. \r\n\r\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the channel to see future videos! Have questions or topics you’d like to see covered in a future video? Let me know by commenting or sending me an email!\r\n\r\nCheck out my psychology guide: Master Introductory Psychology, a low-priced alternative to a traditional textbook: http://amzn.to/2eTqm5s\r\n\r\nChomsky's review of Verbal Behavior:\r\nhttp://cogprints.org/1148/1/chomsky.htm",
