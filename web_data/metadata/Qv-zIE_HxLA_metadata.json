  "description": "Parts of this video were used in the documentary, \"Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media\"     https://zeitgeistfilms.com/film/manufacturingconsent\n\nWatch documentary on youtube:  https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li2m3rvsO0I\n\nThe interview was edited into two (or was it 3?)  segments and played on my public-access show, also called \"Non-Corporate News\",  on Time-Warner Cable channel 3, which then included the communities of Lynn,  Salem, and Swampscott Massachusetts.\n\nThanks to: Noam Chomsky,  Len Caplan, Dan Kline, Peter Sofronas, Mark Achbar, and \"Manufacturing Consent\" crew.\n\nThe \"Manufacturing Consent\" crew setup the lights and microphones.  Without them, this video would've looked and sounded like sh**. If I remember right, I just brought the camera.\n\nLen Caplan has a new youtube channel:  \"What Do You Want To Do?\"  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoI1ZP9PCLPeUHhuzCl6x4A\n#NoamChomsky #NonCorporateNews",
