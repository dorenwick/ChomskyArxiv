We try to lay down his main points in a coherent way, and in doing so, we see that much of his critique follows some themes cherished by Postmodernists themselves. In particular, Chomsky argues that much of postmodernism was an instrument of power wielded to obtain material rewards.  \nChomsky goes particularly hard on the Postmodern tradition and we try to put into video form the essence of his scathing critique.",
