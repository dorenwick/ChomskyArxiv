  "description": "To kick off the new academic year, The Lafayette Club host Professor Noam Chomsky to discuss the current catastrophe in Afghanistan (original airdate: 09/09/21).\n\nNoam Chomsky is an American linguist, philosopher, political activist, and social commentator. He is often referred to as \"the father of modern linguistics\" and is one of the most cited academics alive. He is an Associate Professor at MIT and the Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. His works include \"Who Rules the World?\" and \"Manufacturing Consent\".\n\nHe has been a vociferous critic of many of the USâ€™s military operations, with the War in Afghanistan being no exception.\n\nThe Lafayette Club, the largest speech society at the University of St Andrews, aims to connect young people with leaders from around the world who have some idea what the hell is going on (and may even have some thoughts on what to do about it).\n\nLearn more at: www.thelafayetteclub.com\n\nFacebook: @lafayetteclub https://www.facebook.com/lafayetteclub/\n\nInstagram: @thelafayetteclub https://www.instagram.com/thelafayetteclub/",
