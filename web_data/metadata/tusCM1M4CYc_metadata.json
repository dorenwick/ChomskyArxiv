  "description": "Noam Chomsky on what makes a \"true education.\" There are people who follow our account who will necessarily bristle at a deliberately leftist thinker like Chomsky. But what both anti-establishment leftists and rightists agree on is the failure of the school system to nurture critical, curious adults who are capable, confident, and effective. The school system is buttressed by people who are fearful of change, even though the status quo is demonstrably failing. Keeping kids inside for thousands of hours a year, segmenting their learning into distinct, age-specific groupings, focusing maniacally on memorization over real, deep learning.... these are failings apparent to all of us. We should demand better for our kids.",
