  "title": "Noam Chomsky on DSA, Marx, Consciousness, the American Revolution, and Counter-power",
  "description": "Avram Noam Chomsky, (born December 7, 1928) is an American theoretical linguist whose work from the 1950s revolutionized the field of linguistics by treating language as a uniquely human, biologically based cognitive capacity. Through his contributions to linguistics and related fields, including cognitive psychology and the philosophies of mind and language, Chomsky helped to initiate and sustain what came to be known as the 'cognitive revolution.' Chomsky also gained a worldwide following as a political dissident for his analyses of the pernicious influence of economic elites on U.S. domestic politics, foreign policy, and intellectual culture.\n\nBecome a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PARCMEDIA​\nFollow Us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Vince_Emanuele​\nFollow Us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/1713FranklinSt/​\nFollow Us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/parcmedia/?​...\n\n#PARCMedia​ is a news and media project founded by two USMC veterans, Sergio Kochergin & Vince Emanuele.
