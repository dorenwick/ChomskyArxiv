  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and video quality.\nOn March 31, 2006, Noam Chomsky appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss matters related to his then recent book _Failed States_. \n\n\n\nI combined parts one and two, which were broadcast a few days apart.  De-noised, EQed, and sound leveled, to have better audio quality than the original broadcasts.  For the picture, I did a slight adjustment to the contrast and color. \n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 2006, Failed States, Rogue States, Orlando Bosch, Luis Posada Carriles, George W Bush, War on Terror, Iraq War, Iraq, Nuclear War, Dirty bombs, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Cuba, Israel, Palestine, John Mearsheimer, Stephan Walt, Alan Dershowitz, Norman Finkelstein, Abba Eban, John Lewis Gaddis, Seminole Wars, John Quincy Adams, Executive War, General Peter Pace, Health Care, Activism, Hugo Chavez, Haiti,",
