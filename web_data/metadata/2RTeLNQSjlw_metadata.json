  "description": "Contrapoints is right about voting. In this video, I analyse the arguments made by Natalie Wynn and look at some of the detractors' comments. I also look at the biggest advocates of the non-voting camp, Virgil Texas and Briahna Joy Gray who debated Professor Noam Chomsky on their podcast, Bad Faith. In the end, I tell you a story and respond to your comments from the last video.\n\nSo yeah, Joe Biden sucks but vote for Joe Biden.\n\nhttp://vote.org\n\nWatch Contrapoints' 'Voting' - https://youtu.be/t3Vah8sUFgI\n\nMy video about how Trump could steal the election, and how to prevent that (vote for Joe Biden)- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwRt08d0Fr0\n\n----\n\nStill not convinced to vote by this video and want to change your mind?
