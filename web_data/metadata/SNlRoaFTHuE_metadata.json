  "description": "Buy DVD at http://www.mediaed.org\r\n\r\nOnce relegated to the margins of society, pornography has emerged as one of the most visible and profitable sectors of the cultural industries, assuming an unprecedented role in the mainstream of our popular culture at the same time that its content has become more extreme and harsh, more overtly sexist and racist. This eye-opening and disturbing film tackles the complexity behind this seeming paradox, placing the voices of critics, producers, and performers alongside the observations of men and women as they candidly discuss the role pornography has played in shaping their sexual imaginations and relationships. Honest and non-judgmental, The Price of Pleasure moves beyond the liberal versus conservative debates so common in the culture to paint a myth-busting and nuanced portrait of how pleasure and pain, commerce and power, liberty and responsibility have become intertwined in the most intimate area of our lives. An ideal tool for initiating classroom discussion about this notoriously difficult subject.\r\n\r\nOpen Lens Media & The Media Education Foundation presents\r\nA film by Miguel Picker & Chyng Sun\r\nAssociate Producer: Robert Wosnitzer\r\n\r\nThe Price of Pleasure: Pornography, Sexuality & Relationships\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thepriceofpleasure.com\r\nhttp://www.mediaed.org",
