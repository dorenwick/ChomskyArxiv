  "title": "Noam Chomsky - 1988-11-03 - Interview with Bill Moyers on Propaganda and Democracy.",
  "description": "Be sure to pick at least 720p for best sound and video quality.\nNoam Chomsky had this conversation/interview with Bill Moyers in 1988. It was broadcast on November 3rd of that year. \n\n\n\nAlthough this video has been posted before, I thought to re-up it with improved sound.  I removed a hum/buzz that ran throughout the entire program.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nActivism, Chomsky, 1988, Noam Chomsky, Bill Moyers, Central America, propaganda, Reagan, Nicaragua, Contras, Military Industrial Complex, Office of Public Diplomacy, Woodrow Wilson, Iran-Contra, Pentagon, Dominican Republic, Lyndon Johnson, Laos, Vietnam, 1960's, William Sloan Coffin, Civil Rights Movement,",
