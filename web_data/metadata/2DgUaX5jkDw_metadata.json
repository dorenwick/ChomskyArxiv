  "description": "3 Word Review: “What Kind of Creatures Are We?” by Noam Chomsky - \n\nChomsky's argument that human language and cognition are conditioned by biology is briefly unpacked as he traces both the nature of external (E-) and internal (I- / grammar) language facility and the history of thinkers who wrestled with it. Our external language is a phenomenon of our internal (and perhaps universal/biological) grammar. Thick but enlightening.\n\n #books #bookreviews #bookworm #readreadread #3words  #noamchomsky #whatkindofcreaturesarewe #linguistics #biolinguistics #epistemology #humanlanguage",
