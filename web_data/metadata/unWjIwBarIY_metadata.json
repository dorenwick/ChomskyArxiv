  "title": "Interview: Noam Chomsky on How Bosses Are Making Coronavirus \"Worse, for their Benefit\"",
  "description": "For decades, Noam Chomsky has been a leading intellectual troublemaker. His books and speeches have helped to explain how a world run by corporations and billionaires has led to endless war and catastrophic climate change. Now he is helping to explain how corporations and billionaires are actually making the coronavirus pandemic worse by savagely pursuing policies that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else.\n\nLabor Notes staff writer Chris Brooks interviewed professor Chomsky on Friday, April 10 to learn more about how we got into this momentâ€“and what it will take to get us out of it.",
