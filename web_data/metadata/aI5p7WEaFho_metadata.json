  "title": "Noam Chomsky - 1991-XX-XX - with Gore Vidal. Joint Interview After the Gulf War.",
  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and video.\nGore Vidal sat down for a joint interview with Noam Chomsky in 1991.  They have a lively discussion about the then recent Gulf War, media, education, etc.\n\n\nI improved the sound somewhat by EQing it and removing much of the background hiss/hum, but the poor quality of the initial recording greatly limited what was possible.  The original mix was a very wide stereo, which I found very distracting, so I made it mono. \n\n\n\nThe video was color-corrected and contrast improved, too.\nAs always, this was uploaded in ALAC lossless audio format.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 1991, Noam Chomsky, Gore Vidal, George H.W.
