  "description": "Avram Noam Chomsky[a] (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historical essayist,[b][c] social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\",[d] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\n\n\nWe give new energy into well-known sayings from the past.\nMake our channel a never-ending repository of knowledge that you may consult whenever you need it.\n\nThere is a variety of information to draw from when searching through history for inspiration and motivation, which made making this video challenging.
