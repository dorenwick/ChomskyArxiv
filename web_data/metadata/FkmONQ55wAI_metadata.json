You don't have to type in chat, nor do you have to turn on your camera or mic, but if you do, what you type, say, and show will be recorded and possibly published.  By entering the room, you consent to my ownership and usage of the recorded footage.  I generally honor all requests to remove footage from the raw channel, however, provided there's some sort of reason (being drunk, for example) and no one else in the footage objects.",
