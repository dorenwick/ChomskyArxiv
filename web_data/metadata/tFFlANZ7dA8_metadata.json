  "title": "Noam Chomsky on Ukraine and nuclear armageddon",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky is one of the world's pre-eminent intellectuals, and an icon of dissent going back literally generations. I speak to him about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and what anti-war activists should be saying. What does he think about the role of NATO? Should the left supporting arming Ukraine on the basis this is a naked war of aggression? What are Russia's war aims? What would a peace deal look like in these circumstances - and how would it last? And most of all - does he think a nuclear war is possible?\n\nPlease like, subscribe - and help us take on the Establishment media here: https://patreon.com/owenjones84",
