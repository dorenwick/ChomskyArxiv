  "title": "Noam Chomsky: Opposing Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel's Goal Isn't Survival â€” It's Regional Dominance",
  "description": "http://democracynow.org - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived in the United States as part of his bid to stop a nuclear deal with Iran during a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress on Tuesday. Dozens of Democrats are threatening to boycott the address, which was arranged by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House. Netanyahu's visit comes just as Iran and six world powers, including the United States, are set to resume talks in a bid to meet a March 31 deadline. \"For both Prime Minister Netanyahu and the hawks in Congress, mostly Republican, the primary goal is to undermine any potential negotiation that might settle whatever issue there is with Iran,\" says Noam Chomsky, institute professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"They have a common interest in ensuring there is no regional force that can serve as any kind of deterrent to Israeli and U.S. violence, the major violence in the region.\" Chomsky also responds to recent revelations that in 2012 the Israeli spy agency, Mossad, contradicted Netanyahu's own dire warnings about Iran's ability to produce a nuclear bomb, concluding that Iran was \"not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons.\"  \n\nWatch the full interview with Noam Chomsky on Democracy Now!, and see many more interviews with him over the years: http://www.democracynow.org/appearances/noam_chomsky\n\nDemocracy Now!, is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on 1,300+ TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
