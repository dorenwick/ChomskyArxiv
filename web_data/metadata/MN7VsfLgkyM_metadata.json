  "title": "Noam Chomsky on CRT, Free Speech, DeSantis",
  "description": "Piers Morgan and Noam Chomsky discuss issues of free speech, education, \nCritical Race Theory, and propaganda. Chomsky claims that free speech\nis mainly under attack by the right wing,  but that a minority of leftists \nare also attacking it.  As a phrase, 'critical race theory' is a slogan of the \nright wing.  Conservatives use 'CRT' as a scapegoat for everything they \ndon't like.  As a discipline, Critical Race Theory is a small academic \nmovement that has been around for the last 50 or so years.  Critical Race \nTheory is not taught at any primary or secondary schools. Conservatives \nare really looking to forward non-critical approaches to American history. \nThey want elementary schools to teach students how great America is. \n#criticalracetheory #crt #freespeech #freedom #chomsky #philosophy #piersmorgan #freedomofspeech #rondesantis #rightandleft #right #leftist #Rightwingpropaganda #newleft #race #racism #cancel #cancelled #fascism #america #americanpolitics #culture #culturewar",
