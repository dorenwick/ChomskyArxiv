  "title": "Noam Chomsky at United Nations: It Would Be Nice if the United States Lived up to International Law",
  "description": "http://democracynow.org - After world-renowned scholar Noam Chomsky gave a major address on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the hall of the United Nations General Assembly last week, Amy Goodman interviewed the world-renowned linguist and dissident before an audience of 800 people. Chomsky spoke at an event sponsored by the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. “One important action that the United States could take is to live up to its own laws. Of course it would be nice if it lived up to international law, but maybe that's too much to ask,” Chomsky said.\n\nWatch the full 50-minute discussion with Noam Chomsky at the United Nations aired on Democracy Now!: http://www.democracynow.org/appearances/noam_chomsky\n\nDemocracy Now!, is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on 1,200+ TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
