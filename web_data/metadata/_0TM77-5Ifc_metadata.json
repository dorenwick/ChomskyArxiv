  "title": "Noam Chomsky Destroys the Sam Harris \"Noble Motives\" Just-Cause Argument",
  "description": "Sam Harris often criticizes Chomsky and what he calls \"the regressive left\" for equating the crimes of the US government with the crimes of others, on  the basis that the US government has \"noble motives/intentions\" and the deaths caused by their actions are accidental \"collateral damage\" in the pursuit of these just causes.\n\nHarris never provides any evidence to support the existence of such \"noble motives\" and \"just causes\".\n\nIn this old video Noam Chomsky completely debunks that argument by citing facts about prior actions of the US government.  Chomsky is rebutting Robert Kaplan, but the argument is just against Harris's argument.",
