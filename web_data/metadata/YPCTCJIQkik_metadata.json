  "description": "When Katie's Wednesday night co-host Nando Vila (https://twitter.com/nandorvila) asks Noam Chomsky if The Left has reduced democracy to the act of voting, Chomsky laments: \"The Left has never accepted the Establishment view of democracy, until now.\"  And it sounds like Chomsky's dog is disturbed by this political development as well. \n\nPlease support The Katie Halper Show on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/thekatiehalpershow\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kthalps",
