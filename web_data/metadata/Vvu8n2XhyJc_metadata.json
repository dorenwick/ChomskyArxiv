  "description": "“This is the last phase of European colonisation.”\n\nNoam Chomsky, born on December 7, 1928, is an American professor, public intellectual, and influential figure in linguistics, political activism, and social criticism. He is a pioneer in cognitive science, a laureate professor of linguistics at the University of Arizona, and institute professor emeritus at MIT. Chomsky has authored over 150 books, spanning linguistics, war, and politics, and is one of the most cited living authors. \n\nHe is known for his critiques of contemporary capitalism, U.S. foreign policy, and mass media, and his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are particularly notable. Chomsky is an anti-Zionist and condemns Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, including its settlement building in occupied territories, which he argues is not only illegal but also a major barrier to peace.\n*\n*\n*\nOn October 14, 2014, the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People organised a lecture at their headquarters in New York. Professor Noam Chomsky delivered the lecture as part of the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The event also featured a Q&A session moderated by journalist Amy Goodman from Democracy Now!\n\nIn the video clip, Professor Chomsky is asked by a member of the audience why the U.S. supports Israel. He cites several issues, including Christian Zionism, as a significant factor.",
