  "title": "Ron Paul: Blame the Government! (chomsky, mcveigh, et al)",
  "description": "LOOK ALEX JONES SHEEPLE I am not implying Ron Paul is a terrorist or is for it or anything like that....just throwing something out there about the irrational nature of libertarianism and the nature of some of it's extreme elements...\r\n\r\nRon Paul is  a decent guy but his schtick of blaming the government for all of our society's woes is frightening.  I lived in Oklahoma City in 1995 and worked downtown when the murrah bombing occured.  Timothy McVeigh was radically anti-government (as perhaps were his co-conspirators) and the irrational hatred that is being brewed up by Ron  paul, and the world he wants to create is scary....perhaps moreso than the world the rest of the hoodlums running want to create....",
