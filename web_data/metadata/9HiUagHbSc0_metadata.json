  "title": "\"Sadistic & Grotesque\": Noam Chomsky on How Israel Limits Food & Medicine in Occupied Gaza",
  "description": "http://www.democracynow.org - On Gaza, MIT Professor Noam Chomsky says the debate inside the Israeli government is whether to allow \"bare survival\" or to inflict \"misery and starvation,\" as a former Israeli national security adviser recently proposed. “Israeli experts have calculated in detail exactly how many calories, literally, Gazans need to survive, and if you look at the sanctions that they impose, they’re grotesque,” Chomsky says. “I mean, even John Kerry condemned them bitterly, they’re sadistic — just enough calories to survive.\" Chomsky also addresses the widespread focus on the Hamas charter platform calling for the destruction of Israel. \"The only people who pay attention to it are Israeli propagandists, who love it,\" Chomsky says. \"It was a charter put together by a small group of people under siege, under attack in 1988. And it’s essentially meaningless. There are charters that mean something, but they’re not talked about. So, for example, the electoral program of Israel’s governing party, Likud, states explicitly that there can never be a Palestinian state west of the Jordan River… And they don’t only have it in their charter, you know, their electoral program, but they implement it.\"\nWatch Part I of this interview here: \nhttp://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/7/a_hideous_atrocity_noam_chomsky_on \n\nWatch all appearances of Noam Chomsky on Democracy Now!\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/appearances/noam_chomsky \n\nWatch full Democracy Now! coverage of the Gaza conflict: http://www.democracynow.org/topics/gaza\n\nDemocracy Now!, is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on 1,200+ TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
