Several sources explore the possibility of AI becoming an existential threat, while others focus on the potential for AI to exacerbate economic crises and disrupt labor markets. One source examines the use of AI in propaganda and censorship, highlighting how authoritarian governments are utilizing this technology to control information and suppress dissent. The articles also delve into the concept of \"black swan\" events—unpredictable and highly impactful occurrences—and how AI could potentially trigger such events in the future. Finally, the texts explore the use of AI in cybersecurity, both ethically and for malicious purposes, as well as the importance of developing safeguards and policies to mitigate these risks.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2024/11/10/80-of-surveyed-businesses-dont-have-plans-for-an-ai-related-crisis/\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/05/30/sp053024-crisis-amplifier-how-to-prevent-ai-from-worsening-the-next-economic-downturn\nhttps://time.com/6898967/ai-extinction-national-security-risks-report/\nhttps://fortune.com/2024/06/09/ai-risks-recession-economic-crisis-job-losses-financial-markets-supply-chains-imf/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx-tMK7w5g8\nhttps://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/03/is-ai-an-existential-risk-qa-with-rand-experts.html\nhttps://www.ai-cio.com/news/what-could-go-wrong-5-black-swan-scenarios-for-2024/\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B823KjSvD5FnCc6dc/agi-as-a-black-swan-event\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2024/02/29/grey-swans-on-the-horizon-ai-cyber-pandemics-and-et-scenarios/\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hackergpt-a-powerful-ai-tool-for-ethical-hackers-and-the-cybersecurity-community/\nhttps://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel\n\n#AI #ArtificialIntelligence #TechRisks #Cybersecurity #AIRegulation #FutureOfWork #BlackSwanEvents #AIPropaganda\nhttps://freakonomics.com/2009/08/quotes-uncovered-who-said-no-crisis-should-go-to-waste/\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/06/MN6C13VKH5.DTL&type=politics\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2635701/rahm-emanuel-reprises-never-let-a-crisis-go-to-waste-catchphrase-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/\nhttps://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/political-campaigns/news-cycles\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6233877/\nhttps://www.mandtsystem.com/2014/04/27/the-crisis-cycle-concept-to-practice/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\nhttps://chomsky.info/consent01/\nhttps://www.thecollector.com/manufacturing-consent-noam-chomsky/\nhttps://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2023/repressive-power-artificial-intelligence\nhttps://time.com/6835213/the-future-of-censorship-is-ai-generated/\nhttps://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/toolkit-outsmarting-ai-powered-censorship/\nhttps://hls.harvard.edu/today/network-propaganda-takes-a-closer-look-at-media-and-american-politics/",
