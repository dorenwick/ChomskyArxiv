A very self-serving view.” Chomsky argues that they hold this “self-serving view” despite the fact that “the media is a sham”, owned by wealthy men who run their institutions in their own interests.\n\nMarr misinterprets Chomsky, asking him “how can you know that I’m self-censoring?”\n\nChomsky replies, “I don't say you’re self-censoring. I’m sure you believe everything you say. What I’m saying is that if you believed something different you wouldn’t be sitting where you’re sitting.”\n\n#Journalist #Journalism #iPlayer #Murdoch #rupertmurdoch #JeffBezos #AngelaDavis #DidTheThing #Breadtube #Leftwing #MentalHealth #Censorship #Conspiracy #Communism #Socialism",
