  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and video quality.\nOn April 30, 2005, Noam Chomsky appeared on \"Report from Sante Fe\" - a public television program.  Joining him was Laura Carlsen of the International Relations Center (formally known as the \"Inter-Hemispheric Resource Center\"). The host was Lorene Mills.\n\n\nI used digital noise reduction to strip away a persistent hissing that ran throughout the program, and gave it a light EQing as well.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 2005, NATO, Mexico, Walmart, War on Terror, Iraq War, Afghanistan, Saddam, Bin Laden, Northern Ireland, IRA, Nicaragua, Contras, World Trade Organization, El Salvador, Guatemala, John Negroponte, Liberation Theology, School of the Americas, Archbishop Oscar Romero,",
