  "title": "Noam Chomsky - Ideas of Chomsky BBC Interview (full)",
  "description": "An old interview mostly on Chomsky's linguistics work, philosophy, and some remarks on political views near the end.\n\nNote: the video is taken from Youtube, where it was broken into five segments, when I re-merged the segments the audio got a little strange, so that before the next segment's audio starts the audio from the last segment jumps in for a fraction of a second. Its tolerable though.",
