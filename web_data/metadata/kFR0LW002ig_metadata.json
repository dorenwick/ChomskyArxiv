  "description": "On May 30th, 2017, during a CBMM Research Talk, Noam Chomsky shared insight into his latest book,  “Why Only Us: Language and Evolution” (co-authored with  Robert C. Berwick) where they discuss the biolinguistic  perspective on language, which views  language as a particular object of the  biological world; the computational  efficiency of language as a system of  thought and understanding; the tension  between Darwin’s idea of gradual change  and our contemporary understanding  about evolutionary change and language;  and evidence from nonhuman animals,  in particular vocal learning in songbirds.",
