  "description": "http://FacingFuture.TV - We interviewed Noam Chomsky shortly before COP-24, the UN climate negotiations which took place in Katowice, Poland the first two weeks of December.  The COP itself ended as expected, with little progress and yet another kick of the can down the road. Noam's allusion to Nero in this video is quite apt.\n#FacingFuture #PoliticalCorruption #EconomicNearsightedness\n\nFor more information on the state of our planet visit the FacingFuture Library at  \nhttps://facingfuture.earth/library",
