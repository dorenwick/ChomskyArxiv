  "title": "Malcolm K. Read on Chomsky's reading of Juan Huarte de San Juan (Examen de ingenios)",
  "description": "Profesor Malcolm K. Read talks about Chomsky's notion of a \"creative subject\", and the fact that such a subject is nowhere to be found in a Feudal, organicist text such as Huarte de San Juan's \"Examen de ingenios\", which Chomsky takes to be a precursor of his own innatist, generative theory of universal grammar. It is rather \"bourgeois ideology\" which is at play in 20th-century linguistics and it's unconscious discursive battle to produce a legitimate notion of individuality within capitalism; one that precisely relies on there being a set of conflicting notions of what is a \"free subject\" in Capitalism, the debate between innatism (the Kantian subject) and behaviorism (the Empiricist subject) being one instance of such unconscious ideological struggle.\n\nFor a longuer context of Professor Read's remarks, see part five (V) of this interview: https://youtu.be/TWmQGF9XBSA\n\nInterviewer: Pablo Aparicio Dur√°n (Universidad de Granada)",
