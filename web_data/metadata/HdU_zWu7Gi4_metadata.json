  "title": "The Chomsky Skinner Debate: How Do Humans Acquire Language?",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky never formally debated BF Skinner, but his review of Verbal Behavior explained the shortcomings of Skinner’s analysis and why his behaviorist theory of operant conditioning was inadequate to understand human language acquisition. Chomsky suggested that human beings possess a language acquisition device, an aspect of their nature which disposes them to develop the fundamentals of language in a way that other animals cannot. In other words, people aren’t simply more complicated pigeons, though we do play ping pong and occasionally dance like birds.",
