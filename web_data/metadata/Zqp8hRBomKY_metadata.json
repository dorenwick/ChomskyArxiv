  "description": "Trump has nominated many unqualified, yet loyal potential cabinet members, all of whom are staunchly, violently pro-Israel. Much of the liberal media in the days leading to the election has argued that a Trump presidency will be worse for the prsopects of Palestinian Statehood. But Is this true? Join us tonight on state of play to examine Israeli Media manipulation, the loss of image and soft power, and if a hawkish and unfettered Trump administration will actually serve Israel in the long-run.\n\nFollow Alan Macleod on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/alan.r.macleod/?hl=en\nFollow Greg Stoker on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/greg.j.stoker/?hl=en\n\nSupport Independent Journalism: https://www.patreon.com/mintpressnews",
