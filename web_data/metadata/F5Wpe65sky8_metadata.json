  "title": "Chomsky vs Foucault on Creativity & Science (1971)",
  "description": "A few clips of Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault science and creativity in their famous 1971 debate. This is a version of an upload from the previous channel. The translation is my own, although I referenced the published text (which by the way was edited by Foucault prior to publication, which is why there are various differences between the published transcript and the actual recording). The audio has also been slightly improved.\n\nThe debate was about human nature and took place in November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Nederlands, as part of the “International Philosophers Project” initiated by the Dutch Broadcasting Foundation and arranged by the Dutch philosopher Fons Elders, who was also the moderator.\n\nMore Short Videos & Clips: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE8v8UVlc7JuuNHwvhkaOvzc\n\n#Philosophy #Chomsky #Foucault",
