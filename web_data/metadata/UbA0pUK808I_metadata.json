  "description": "\"If you're an activist it's second nature to ask what are the consequences of my choices, not I'll do it because it makes me feels good,\" US academic Noam Chomsky tells Mehdi Hasan in this web extra. \n\nThe Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) pro-Palestinian movement has called for the boycott not only of Israeli made goods, but also of cultural and educational products and institutions. \n\nWhile Chomsky supports BDS campaigns \"aimed at the occupied territories\", he says he is opposed to those \"actions against Israel itself\". \n\n\"Just as I do not suggest boycotting Harvard University and my own university, even though the United States is involved in horrific acts. [â€¦] You might as well boycott the United States,\" the academic adds.\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n- Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",
