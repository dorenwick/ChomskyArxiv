  "title": "\"Chomsky on Evolution\", Stony Brook Interview #3 with Richard Larson",
  "description": "Chomsky's devastating attack on behaviorism launched the cognitive revolution. Chomsky expresses his skepticism about evolutionary \"just so\" stories about language and sets forth his own view that language did not evolve through natural selection for the purpose of communication but is instead a recursive linking of internal interfaces that evolved for the purposes of thought. Directed by Dini-Diskin Zimmerman, produced by Gary Mar, DVD design by Takafumi Ide.",
