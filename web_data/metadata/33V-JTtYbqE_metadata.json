  "title": "Noam Chomsky: Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff \"Impeached by a Gang of Thieves\"",
  "description": "http://democracynow.org - As protests continue in Brazil over the Legislature’s vote to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and put her on trial, Noam Chomsky notes that \"we have the one leading politician who hasn’t stolen to enrich herself, who’s being impeached by a gang of thieves, who have done so. That does count as a kind of soft coup.\" Rousseff’s replacement, Brazil’s former vice president, Michel Temer, is a member of the opposition PMDB party who is implicated in Brazil’s massive corruption scandal involving state-owned oil company Petrobras, and has now appointed an all-white male Cabinet charged with implementing corporate-friendly policies.\n\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
