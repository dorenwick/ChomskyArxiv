We'll analyze the media's role in propaganda, the illusion of choice in democracy, and the importance of critical thinking and dissent in the fight for a more just and equitable society.\n\n#noamchomsky #manufacturingconsent #propaganda #media #politics #democracy #criticalthinking #dissent #activism #socialjustice #truth #freedom #manipulation #power #media literacy #fakenews #disinformation #corporations #militaryindustrialcomplex #consumerism #philosophy #motivation #life #selfimprovement #selfawareness #growth #freedom #democracy #money #wealth #informationwar #education #future",
