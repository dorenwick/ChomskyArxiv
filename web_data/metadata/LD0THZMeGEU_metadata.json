  "description": "Noam Chomsky: Unconventional Wisdom (Alternative Radio Podcast)\nMay 18, 2012\nhttp://www.guernicamag.com/daily/noam-chomsky-unconventional-wisdom-alternative-radio-podcast/\n By David Barsamian with Noam Chomsky\nBy arrangement with Alternative Radio.\n\nConventional wisdom is a term one often hears. It is the generally accepted belief, opinion, or judgment, about a particular matter. In the U.S., the ruling political class and the media are major propagators of conventional wisdom. For example, when it comes to international law the U.S. exempts itself while holding its enemies to account. Or bombing and invading another country. Washington reserves that right for itself and its allies. It's just a given. There is one set of rules for the master and his close friends and another for everybody else. All of these notions are presupposed and embedded. They are so deeply rooted that they don't even come up for discussion. Whoever breaks from the norm risks ostracism and ridicule. But often it is thinkers outside the box who rock the casbah and make a positive difference.",
