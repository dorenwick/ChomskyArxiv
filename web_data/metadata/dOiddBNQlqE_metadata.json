  "description": "In this video, we take a closer look at the Battle of Yorktown, one of the most important events in the American Revolutionary War. The British fleet tried to rescue General Cornwallis by sea, but they were stopped, and the British army was forced to retreat. When Cornwallis tried to escape by land, he was trapped by a combined force of 16,000 American and French soldiers. The Patriots then launched a relentless attack on the British fortifications at Yorktown, setting the stage for a decisive victory.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, who you might know from the famous musical, played a key role in this battle. As one of George Washington’s trusted officers, Hamilton led a daring night attack and captured two important British forts, cutting off Cornwallis’s last route of escape. This action helped seal the fate of the British forces and was a turning point in the war.\n\nThe video also explores how this battle led to the surrender of Cornwallis on October 19, 1781, and how it marked the end of the Revolutionary War. We’ll break down the strategic decisions, key figures, and pivotal moments that led to the American victory.
