  "title": "Noam Chomsky Discusses Israel with Professor John Haas",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky talks with Professor John Haas about UN Security Council Resolution 242 regarding Israel's annexation and occupation of Palestine.  Accuses Israel of starving, harassing and murdering Palestinians while US supports Israel with policy decisions. War crime probes by the International Court of Justice and more.\nChomsky explains how US vetoes of resolutions that oppose their policy, as well as US military aid to Israel, have prevented a diplomatic solution. \nChomsky also critiques Israel's narrative of being a defensive and reactive force, and suggests ways to protest US policy towards Israel, such as an anti-apartheid struggle and the possibility of an international criminal court war crimes probe into the 2014 assault on Gaza.\nFilmed on 3/20/2018 at the University of Arizona.",
