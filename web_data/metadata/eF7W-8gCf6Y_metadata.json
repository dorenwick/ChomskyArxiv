  "description": "Noam Chomsky on October 1, 2019...\n\nA few comments about this video:\n\n1. This is an amateur work. I never intended to do a professional-like interview.\n\n2. I’m not an experienced interviewer. Actually that was the first time ever that I did an interview.\n\n3. Noam Chomsky has written books about language for the “general public” and for the expert/specialist. I’m obviously on the general public side.\n\n4. It took place under a cultural exchange program between his university (in the US) and mine (in Mexico).\n\n5.  If you want to read an excellent interview about language, “The Science of Language” is the book to get. Philosopher James McGilvray did such a wonderful job.\n\n6. Relax and enjoy Noam Chomsky.",
