  "description": "Be sure to pick at least 720p for best sound quality. Noam begins at 1:36 in.\n\nOn January 24, 1976, Noam Chomsky delivered the Cecil and Ida Green Lecture at the Vancouver Institute in British Columbia, Canada, on the topic: \"Human Nature: The Linguistic Evidence.\"  He takes questions after the talk.\n\n\nThe source was a medium bitrate MP3 copied from a very old cassette tape which in turn was probably copied from a reel to reel master - a master that probably no longer exists.  One of the worst sounding of his talks I've found: plenty of noise, hiss, hum, and suffering from severe clipping from careless transfer(s).  Not only that, but it needed severe speed correction, as it was running slow by about 5.5 percent.  I worked on this one for about 20 hours, running it through various treatments: de-noising, EQing, speed-correcting, and applying a double dose of digital de-clipping, and going over it second by second to mute or reduce every errant sound I could.  It's not great, not even good, but listenable. The best sounding part is the first hour, the bulk of the lecture.    \n\n\nTags:\n\nChomsky, 1976, Language, Linguistics, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Karl Marx, Alienation of Labor, Mind/Body Problem, Evolutionary Biology, Nature/Nurture, Ralph Cudworth, David Hume, Empiricism, René Descartes, Isaac Newton, Facial Recognition, Ernest Rutherford,",
