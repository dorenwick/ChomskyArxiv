  "description": "Be sure to pick 720p for best sound and video quality.\nOn July 14, 2003, Noam Chomsky gave presentation, with Q&A on the topic: Language and the Mind Revisited - The Biolinguistic Turn\n\n\nI de-noised and lightly EQed the audio, which turned out very well.\nAlas, the best copies left of this talk seem to be 240p, but I fixed the aspect ratio, which was far too wide.  Hopefully a better master will surface someday.\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nChomsky, 2003, Alan Turing, Language acquisition, Behavioralism, Linguistics, Language, Cognitive science, Philosophy, Neuroscience,",
