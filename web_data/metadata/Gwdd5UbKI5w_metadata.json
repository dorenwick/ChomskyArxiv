  "description": "Competence vs Performance in Linguistics Chomsky's Key Concepts\nIn this video, we dive into Noam Chomsky's influential distinction between Competence and Performance in linguistics. Learn how Competence refers to a speaker's internal knowledge of language rules, while Performance is how language is actually used in practice. Through clear examples and simple explanations, you'll understand how these concepts help bridge the gap between knowing a language and using it in real life. Perfect for linguistics students and anyone interested in language theory!\n#vocabulary #linguistics #langauage \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/anastariq287\nhttps://www.twitter.com/anastariq287\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/anastariq287",
