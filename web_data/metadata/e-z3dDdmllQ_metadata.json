  "title": "Understanding the Chomsky Hierarchy: Definition and Overview | Formal Languages & Automata Theory",
  "description": "In this video, we dive into the Chomsky Hierarchy, a foundational concept in Formal Languages and Automata Theory (FLAT). Learn about the four levels of the hierarchy, including Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, and Recursively Enumerable languages, and understand their importance in computer science and computational linguistics. This video is perfect for students and anyone interested in deepening their knowledge of language theory. Make sure to subscribe for more insights on FLAT topics!",
