  "title": "Noam Chomsky on BDS and How the Israeli Occupation is \"Much Worse Than Apartheid\"",
  "description": "http://www.democracynow.org - MIT Professor Noam Chomsky discusses U.S. support for Israel; the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS); and the blockade of Gaza. \"In the Occupied Territories, what Israel is doing is much worse than apartheid,\" Chomsky says. \"To call it apartheid is a gift to Israel, at least if by 'apartheid' you mean South African-style apartheid… There’s a crucial difference. The South African Nationalists needed the black population. That was their workforce. The Israeli relationship to the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories is totally different. They just don’t want them. They want them out, or at least in prison.\"\n\nWatch Part I of this interview here: \nhttp://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/7/a_hideous_atrocity_noam_chomsky_on \n\nWatch full Democracy Now! coverage of the Gaza conflict: http://www.democracynow.org/topics/gaza\n\nDemocracy Now!, is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on 1,200+ TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
