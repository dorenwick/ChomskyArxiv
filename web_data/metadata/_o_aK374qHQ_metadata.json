  "title": "chill lofi hiphop lecture - Noam Chomsky  - Relax Against the Machine ep. 2",
  "description": "Relax Against the Machine is a showcase combining chill lofi hip hop beats with great lectures.\n\n**Note: None of this is edited to fit the beat in any way, I just hit play on the lecture and the hip hop mix at the same time and our \"guest lecturers\" naturally hold an outstanding cadence on their own. All dramatic pauses that land on point with beat drops/changes are really happening in real time and are completely happenstantial... Hope you enjoy chilling out and relaxing to some of the great thinkers (and accidental rappers) of our time.\n\n-Relax Against the Machine-\nEpisode 2 - \"You Keep Saying That Word\"\nPolitical Terminology and some Background History provided by the Father of Cognitive Linguistics and one of my personal heroes: \nNoam Chomsky\nhttps://chomsky.info/\n\nFeatured Audio:\nProfessor Chomsky x  chillhop endless sunday mix\n\nMusic: Chillhop Endless Sunday \nhttps://youtu.be/D_uLM5i0Z4c\nEndless Sunday is a two hour mix of Chilllhop beats and hip hop instrumentals, we hope you find a quiet place to relax and listen. \n\n🎧 Download / Stream ・ https://chillhop.ffm.to/endlesssunday... \n\n⏱ Track List (* = unreleased)\n00:00:00 Toonorth - Silience\n00:03:12 Toonorth - Chrysalism\n00:05:46 Yasper - Birds Fly Higher Than The Moon\n00:08:27 Moods, Yasper - Vibe Vibe\n00:10:34 Aviino - London Love Letters\n00:13:28 Montell Fish - jam session\n00:16:01 Sleepy Fish - Bookshelves *\n00:18:05 Middle School - back when it all made sense\n00:21:20 G Mills, Cloudchord - Sunlit\n00:24:22 Psalm Trees, Guillaume Muschalle - bringmesun\n00:26:35 Sugi.wa - Changing Lanes\n00:28:52 Montell Fish - Imagination *\n00:31:00 Psalm Trees - fiveyearsago\n00:33:47 Delayde - Sundew ft.
