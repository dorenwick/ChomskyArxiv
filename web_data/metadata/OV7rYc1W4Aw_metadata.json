  "description": "Hello Everyone! \nToday in this video, I am going to Discuss about Noam Chomsky's Biological Theory of Language Acquisition.He believes that children are born with an inherited ability to learn any human language. He claims that certain linguistic structures which children use so accurately must be already imprinted on the child‚Äôs mind. So, in this session, we will study about this theory in detail and find out how children are able to acquire language and why Chomsky's Theory is called Biological Theory.\n\nStairs to Excellence is an Educational channel on YouTube, where we prepare for B.Ed. exams for all semesters.
