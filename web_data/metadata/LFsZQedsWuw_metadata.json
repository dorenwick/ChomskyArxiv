  "title": "Noam Chomsky on Libya, Israel & GOP Presidential Candidates' 'Utterly Outlandish' Positions",
  "description": "DemocracyNow.org - In the extended interview with Noam Chomsky--noted activist, linguist, and philosopher--Democracy Now! asked the professor about his views on the war in Libya, the diplomatic spat between Israel and Turkey, and the positions of the GOP presidential candidates. Regarding Libya, Dr. Chomsky says, \"you could have made a case for a no-fly zone and protection of civilians, but I think it's much harder to make a case for direct participation in a civil war and undercutting of possible options that were supported by almost the entire world.\" Chomsky goes on to note that Turkey and Egypt have been key allies for Israel and that the deterioration of their relations \"contributes very substantially to Israel's isolation in the region.\" When pressed about the upcoming 2012 presidential election, Dr. Chomsky said that while he is no fan of President Obama, the positions of most Republican candidates on issues such as climate change are \"utterly outlandish.\"\r\n\r\nWatch Part 1 of this interview: http://youtu.be/4eRRyQ6dsPg\r\n\r\nFOLLOW DEMOCRACY NOW!
