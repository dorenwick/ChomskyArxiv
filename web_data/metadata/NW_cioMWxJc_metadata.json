  "description": "On the hundredth day of Biden's presidency, acclaimed political dissident and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky joined political unions from Fordham, Columbia, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago to discuss several contemporary political topics.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n3:02 What should the United States do with extra COVID-19 vaccines, and what effect might giving them away have on American soft power?\n7:09 Would you please reflect on the legacy of the Afghanistan War? Do you agree with Biden’s course of action?\n16:24 How might the advent of remote work post-pandemic change the dynamic and the feasibility of labor organizing? \n28:42 To what degree should universities regulate speech, especially hateful speech, if at all? \n33:11 Can, and should we, manufacture consent of the American Public for objectively ‘good’ causes—for example getting a vaccine? \n38:36 Is it always best to support labor when certain labor unions promote corrupt practices? \n40:01 If the government stops funding fossil fuel companies, do you think those companies will use this as an excuse to raise oil prices, and then blame the left retroactively?\n43:56 To what extent should effort and resources be expended to document and revive languages that have been destroyed by forces such as colonization?\n50:21 What do you believe is the correct path forward in respect to modern day colonies like Puerto Rico?",
