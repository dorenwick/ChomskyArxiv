  "title": "Noam Chomsky | on Israel's war against Palestine",
  "description": "\"Greater Israel refers to what is happening on the ground, as Israel has moved systematically to integrate parts of the West Bank illegally into Israel itself.\"\n\nTheodor meon and other Israeli legal authorities agree that Israel's actions are illegal, with 100% agreement outside of the Israeli High Court.\n\nNoam Chomsky highlights the shift in perception of Israel as a result of its actions in Gaza, leading to increased criticism and pariah status.\n\nThe fact that 100% of relevant opinion regards it as an Israeli occupation and illegal activities in the occupied territories makes it an international problem.\n\n#noamchomsky",
