  "title": "Israel & Palestine: Possible Futures — a Discussion with Noam Chomsky",
  "description": "The “Israel & Palestine: Possible Futures” series, co-sponsored by the Maimonides Chair in Jewish Studies and the Program in Middle East and Islamic Studies, offers a venue for knowledgeable people from all points of view to speculate about real needs, realistic steps, and possible positive directions toward more equitable conditions in the region.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nProfessor Noam Chomsky is an academic and public intellectual known as the founder of modern linguistics. He is laureate professor of linguistics at the University of Arizona and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is author and contributor to over 100 books on political topics such as U.S. foreign policy, globalization, labor, and geopolitics. An observer of Israel and the Middle East from his first stay on a kibbutz in 1953, Professor Chomsky recently referred to Israel as “the leading issue of my life since early childhood.”",
