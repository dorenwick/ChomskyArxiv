  "description": "Linguistic Competence: Linguistics Competence defines the system of rules that governs an individual‚Äôs tacit understanding of what is acceptable and what is not in the language they speak.  The concept, introduced by the linguist Noam Chomsky in 1965, was intended to address certain assumptions about language, especially in structuralist linguistics, where the idea of an unconscious system had been extensively elaborated and schematized.  Competence can be regarded as a revision of the idea of the language system.\n\nLinguistics Performance :\nThe term linguistic performance was used by Noam Chomsky in 1960 to describe \"the actual use of language in concrete situations\". It is used to describe both the production, sometimes called parole, as well as the comprehension of language. Performance is defined in opposition to \"competence\"; the latter describes the mental knowledge that a speaker or listener has of language.\n\nNoam Chomsky separates competence and performance; he describes  'competence' as an idealized capacity that is located as a psychological or mental property or function and ‚Äòperformance‚Äô as the production of actual utterances.   In short, competence involves ‚Äúknowing‚Äù the language and performance involves ‚Äúdoing‚Äù something with the language. The difficulty with this construct is that it is very difficult to assess competence without assessing performance.\n\nMuhammad Tayyab is public speaker,  teacher and trainer.
