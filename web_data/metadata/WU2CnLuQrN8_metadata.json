  "title": "Chomsky-Foucault Debate on Power vs Justice - Part 2 (1971)",
  "description": "A few more clips of Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault discussing justice, power, and the notion of human nature in their famous 1971 debate. This is a version of an upload from the previous channel. The translation is my own and the audio has been improved. \n\nThe debate was about human nature and took place in November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Nederlands, as part of the “International Philosophers Project” initiated by the Dutch Broadcasting Foundation and arranged by the Dutch philosopher Fons Elders, who was also the moderator.\n\nPart 1 can be found here: https://youtu.be/xpVQ3l5P0A4\n\n#Philosophy #Chomsky #Foucault",
