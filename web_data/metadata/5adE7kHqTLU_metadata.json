This content is protected under DMCA Laws.\n\nOn Power, Dissent and Racism is a 60 minute video based on a series of talks and conversations with Professor Noam Chomsky (with filmmaker Nicolas Rossier) taken in 2002 and 2003 in New York and Cambridge, Mass. \n\nIn this video, Nicolas Rossier interviews Chomsky who presents with rigorous analysis and humor his reflection on the motivations behind 9/11 and its consequences on the international system. * \nChomsky starts with the principle that we need to think globally when we want to comprehend the world of today. He defines the notion of terrorism within its historical context and gives his thoughts on how we should fight it without exercising the politics of the most powerful. * \nChomsky also gives his personal perspectives on the role of the Media in the war on terrorism, and personal views on racism against Arabs and Muslims since 9/11 and much more.",
