  "title": "Noam Chomsky: The Limitations and Problems with \"Just War\" Theory",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky examines the limitations and problems of \"Just War\" theory in a talk given to students at the United States West Point Military Academy in West Point, New York on 4/20/2006.  Chomsky finds that the body of work known as \"Just War\" theory, which attempts to establish a criteria where acts of war are justified, has a questionable theoretical framework and fails to provide acceptable universal justifications for acts of war. \n\nA somewhat remarkable event were one of the most prominent anti-war voices in the United States is speaking to cadets at the West Point Military Academy about problems with the pro-war rational that is a part of their educational curriculum.  The presentation is followed by an audience question and answer session were cadets challenge and seek elaboration of Chomsky's analysis.\n\n Video editing and restoration by Chant Media.",
