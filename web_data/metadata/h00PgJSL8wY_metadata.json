  "description": "Further details: http://www.soas.ac.uk/cisd/events/27oct2009-noam-chomsky-crises-and-the-unipolar-moment.html\n\nIt is widely felt that the fall of the Soviet Union left a unipolar world, dominated by the remaining superpower, and that the \"moment\" is coming to a close with the collapse of the Anglo-Saxon \"free market\" economic model. Investigation of this two-decade \"moment\" can provide considerable insight into what came before, and possibilities for shaping the future.\n\nPlease note that Chomsky's presentation starts 11 minutes in.",
