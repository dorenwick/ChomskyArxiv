  "description": "http://www.democracynow.org - Noam Chomsky weighs in on the Black Lives Matter movement across the United States, calling it a response to the unresolved consequences of slavery and racism dating back hundreds of years. \"[Slavery] is a large part of the basis for our wealth and privilege,\" Chomsky says. \"Is there a slave museum in the United States? The first one is just being established now with a private donor. This is the core of our history along with the extermination and expulsion of the native population. But it's not part of our consciousness.\" \n\nWatch the full interview with Noam Chomsky on Democracy Now!, and see many more interviews with him over the years: http://www.democracynow.org/appearances/noam_chomsky\n\nDemocracy Now!, is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on 1,300+ TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
