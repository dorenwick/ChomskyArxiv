  "description": "How do babies get so good at language so quickly? Because they already know a lot from the beginning about how language works. In this week's episode of The Ling Space, we talk about Universal Grammar and evidence that babies are little language acquisition geniuses.\n\nThis week's tag language: Japanese!\n\nThis is Topic #1 - our very first video!\n\nFind us on all the social media worlds:\nTumblr: thelingspace.tumblr.com\nTwitter: @TheLingSpace\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/thelingspace/\n\nAnd at our website, www.thelingspace.com!\n\nThe website also has extra content about the topic, as well as forums to discuss this episode, and linguistics more generally!\n\nIf you're looking for the paper on the phonological models, that's Lisa Pearl's 2011 paper, \"When unbiased probabilistic learning is not enough: Acquiring a parametric system of metrical phonology.\"  http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~lpearl/papers/Pearl2011_UnbiasedAcqParam.pdf\n\nSubtitles:\nSpanish subtitles by Federico Falletti\n\nLooking forward to next week!",
