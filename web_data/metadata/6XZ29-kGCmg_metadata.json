  "title": "Noam Chomsky Interview",
  "description": "Prof. Noam Chomsky is a world-renowned intellectual whose speeches, discussions and writings have been widely loved and admired by workers, activists, and scholars for over fifty years. He is a living legend whose association is much coveted by any students of U.S. and global politics, economics, language and culture, environment, and other subjects. Dr. Partha Banerjee finds it a matter of divine intervention to have known him for twenty years, and had the opportunity to talk to him on camera – this time with support from IBEW Local 3. Union workers across America and the world would be immensely enlightened if they take the time to watch and share this one-on-one conversation – on subjects close to their hearts and minds.\n\nTo learn more about the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry, please visit us at www.jibei.org",
