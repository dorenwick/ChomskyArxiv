  "description": "Noam Chomsky discussing birdsong and human language, in a discussion session of a Lorentz workshop at Leiden University in 2012. In particular, he is talking about how recent claims of a kind of 'context-free grammar' in songbirds have been shown to be false. He mentions zebra finches, but the work was actually done on Bengalese finches, by Abe & Watanabe (Nature Neurosci (2011) 14:1067--1074). The paper that disproves their hypothesis (\"the material has been reanalyzed by Bolhuis, Berwick and others\") is Beckers et al. (2012) Birdsong neurolinguistics: Songbird context-free grammar claim is premature. NeuroReport, 23, 139-145. UG = Universal Grammar. The full discussion session, as well as Chomsky's talk, can be seen here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oszQqVUsnc\nFootage courtesy of Prof. Pierre Pica.",
