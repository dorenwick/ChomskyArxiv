(1989)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Views\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6dkyj3q\n\nAmerica's outstanding radical intellectual, Noam Chomsky discusses the ideological war waged by the Reagan administration against the American people, particularly within the framework of the situations in El Salvador and\nNicaragua. He also evaluates the complicity of the mass media in these\nefforts. Chomsky maintains that because of widespread opposition to its\npolicies, the Reagan administration regarded the US population as enemy\nterritory, and had to resort to covert operations domestically and\ninternationally to accomplish its goals. In addition to Chomsky's speech, we\npresent reviews of books and articles by Chomsky relating to the mass media.\n\n¤ Noam Chomsky\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky\nhttp://www.chomsky.info/\n\nNews: February 7, 1989\nChomsky speech: March 2, 1988\nCopyright February, 1989\n\n\nThis movie is part of the collection: Alternative Views\n\nProducer: Frank Morrow\nProduction Company: Alternative Information Network\nAudio/Visual: sound, color\nLanguage: English\n\n© Creative Commons license: \nAttribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/",
