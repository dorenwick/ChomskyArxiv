Watch the full documentary on FilmsForAction.org.\n\n________________\n\nOUR STORY\nFilms For Action is a library for people who want to change the world.\n\nOur mission is to empower citizens with the knowledge and perspectives essential to creating a more compassionate, just, regenerative, and democratic society. \n\nFilms For Action was founded in 2006 by a few friends in Lawrence, Kansas, after realizing how essential healthy media is to a healthy democracy. (Fun fact: This insight came from watching The Corporation!)\n\nOver the last 18 years, we've curated over 1,000 free documentaries and 5,000 short films, spanning almost every topic related to changing the world.\n\nDuring this time we've been able to reach over 70 million people - not by owning a TV network or spending truckloads of cash on advertising, but because millions of awesome people keep sharing 'films for action' with their friends on social media.",
