  "title": "Alex Jones Interviews Noam Chomsky on 25-MAY-2001",
  "description": "An otherwise excellent interview is cut short when the men enter in a disagreement about guns. Jones loses his cool and hangs up on Chomsky. Jones then commences to verbally bash Chomsky and calls him a \"shill of the New World Order.\" In late 2013, on the air, Jones admits to losing his cool during the 2001 interview and said that quite some time later he sent an email to Chomsky with an apology. Jones tells a caller who suggested a new interview that he doubts Chomsky would come back on the show.",
