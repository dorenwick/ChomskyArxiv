  "description": "Kennedy School of Government, November 29, 2005\n\nWe bring you a debate between Noam Chomsky and Alan Dershowtiz on the question, \"Israel and Palestine After Disengagement: Where Do We Go From Here?\" Dershowitz argued for a political solution based on an Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian towns and a mobile security fence to protect Israel's borders, while Chomsky insisted that the main obstacle to peace in the region is U.S.-Israeli insistence on maintaining settlements and rejecting minimal Palestinian rights. They faced off at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nDownload a transcript of the debate: http://bit.ly/yotZtf\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
