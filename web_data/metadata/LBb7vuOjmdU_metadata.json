  "title": "Noam Chomsky's Linguistic Philosophy: Syntactic Structures, Language and Mind",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky is known as one of the most influential academics in the 20th century. Yet, half of his academic story is brushed over. And in many ways, for decent reasons: his analysis of political economy and media relations has influenced left-thinkers for decades, but in consequence of this, his study of language and mental structures that support said language, has been brushed over. Here we explore Chomsky's linguistic philosophy, his influences in the philosophical canon, and how philosophy has shaped his linguistics.\n\nThis entire channel is funded by you all.
