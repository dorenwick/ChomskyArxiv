He stated that the world, including the United States, has been “moving toward a more autocratic and absolutist structure.” According to Professor Chomsky, the concept of democracy has been narrowed and limited over the years. He also discussed the impact this narrowing will have on modern society. Professor Chomsky has been a member of the faculty at MIT since 1955, where he teaches linguistics and modern language. He has also written numerous publications on linguistics, philosophy, foreign policy, government and politics. The Thistle is a bi-weekly newspaper published by students at MIT.
