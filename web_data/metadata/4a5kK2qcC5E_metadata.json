Her research examines the nature of linguistic competence, its origins, and its interaction with reading ability. She’s the author of the book The Phonological Mind. She will also be releasing a new book in the near future, The Blind Storyteller. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about what is Linguistics, and how it’s done nowadays; what is innate and learned in language; if we are the only species that has language; why written language is different from spoken language, and why it’s more difficult to learn; and also if language influences how we perceive things in the world.\n\nTime Links:\n00:43  What do we study in Linguistics?\n03:14  Skinner, Chomsky, and language acquisition                   \n16:36  The innateness of language          \n18:33  The relationship between sounds and the things they refer to    \n22:43  Language, cognition, and the body      \n30:29  Do other animals have language?         \n38:40  Spoken language and sign language  \n44:40  Critical periods in language acquisition\n50:29  About studies on feral children\n52:17  Written language\n1:00:00  To what extent does language influence the way we think?\n1:09:28  Follow Dr. Berent’s work!\n--\nFollow Dr. Berent’s work:\nFaculty page: https://cos.northeastern.edu/faculty/iris-berent/\nPhonology and Reading Laboratory: https://tinyurl.com/yafkqedp\nBook “The Phonological Mind”: https://tinyurl.com/yca9up5x\n--\nA HUGE THANK YOU TO MY PATRONS: KARIN LIETZCKE, ANN BLANCHETTE, JUNOS, SCIMED, PER HELGE HAAKSTD LARSEN, LAU GUERREIRO, RUI BELEZA, MIGUEL ESTRADA, ANTÓNIO CUNHA, CHANTEL GELINAS, JIM FRANK, JERRY MULLER, FRANCIS FORD, AND HANS FREDRIK SUNDE!\n\nI also leave you with the link to a recent montage video I did with the interviews I have released until the end of June 2018:\nhttps://youtu.be/efdb18WdZUo\n\nAnd check out my playlists on:\nPSYCHOLOGY: https://tinyurl.com/ybalf8km\nPHILOSOPHY: https://tinyurl.com/yb6a7d3p\nANTHROPOLOGY: https://tinyurl.com/y8b42r7g\n\n#TheDissenter #IrisBerent #Linguistics",
