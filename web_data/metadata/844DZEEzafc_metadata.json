  "title": "Noam Chomsky - Uncovering the Truth about Chinas Military Spending",
  "description": "In this enlightening YouTube Shorts clip, we debunk misconceptions about China's military build-up, as reported by Western media. Using credible data from SIPRI, the Swedish Pre-Search Institute, we illustrate that China's per capita military expenditures over the past decade have remained constant, contrary to popular belief. As China's population grows, so does its military, but it still significantly lags behind the US in terms of overall military expenditure. Join us in this brief yet informative discussion to separate facts from Western propaganda. Don't forget to hit subscribe for more unbiased geopolitical analyses!",
