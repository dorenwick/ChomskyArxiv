  "title": "Noam Chomsky - The U.S. Rules the World (interviewed by David Barsamian on June 21, 2021)",
  "description": "Many years ago I heard Noam Chomsky lecture. He compared U.S. foreign policy to the way the mafia operates. That caught the audience’s attention. Everyone had seen The Godfather movie. Chomsky went on to explain that obedience to the Godfather was non-negotiable. Do what you’re told and you’ll not only be protected but richly rewarded. And if you step out of line, the Godfather will come down on you. So it is with U.S. foreign policy. Dissent is not tolerated. Countries like Cuba, Nicaragua, Iran, Chile, Indonesia and others, with politics and systems that defied Washington, have felt the wrath of U.S. power. The U.S. rules the world.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Alternative Radio provides information, analyses and views that are frequently ignored or distorted in other media.
