  "title": "How the World Works - Noam Chomsky",
  "description": "Noam Chomsky’s How the World Works invites readers into an eye-opening exploration of power dynamics, U.S. foreign policy, economic systems, and media manipulation. Presented as a compilation of his speeches and interviews, the book offers a scathing critique of institutional structures that maintain global inequality. Far from being an academic treatise, Chomsky’s arguments resonate with a profound urgency, encouraging readers to question the narratives shaping their understanding of the world.",
