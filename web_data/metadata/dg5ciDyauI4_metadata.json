  "title": "Noam Chomsky on what gives him hope in the midst of a pandemic",
  "description": "In the midst of an unprecedented crisis — with many millions at risk of economic hardship, illness and death — what gives Noam Chomsky hope? The world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author says he finds inspiration in the actions of popular movements around the world demanding justice, as well as everyday working people — especially medical workers.  \"It's an inspiring tribute to the resources of the human spirit, a model of what can be done, along with the popular actions, the moves to create a progressive international,\" he says. \"These are all very positive signs.\" Chomsky notes that he has lived through other dark times and seen things get better, such as the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Civil Rights Movement that ended racial segregation in the United States. \"That's the basis for hope,\" he says.\n\n#DemocracyNow\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
