  "description": "Yanis Varoufakis considers himself a politician by necessity, not by choice. An economist and academic by training, he became Greece’s finance minister amidst the country's financial crisis, creating an image for himself both beloved and reviled. He discusses his complicated role in his new book, And the Weak Suffer What They Must?: Europe's Crisis and America's Economic Future, and on the live stage alongside renowned academic and theorist Noam Chomsky. \n\nNoam Chomsky is widely credited with having revolutionised the field of modern linguistics. Chomsky is the author of numerous best-selling political works, which have been translated into scores of countries worldwide. Among his most recent books are Hegemony or Survival, Failed States, Hopes and Prospects, and Masters of Mankind. Haymarket Books recently released twelve of his classic works in new editions. His latest books are What Kind of Creatures Are We? And Who Rules the World?\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n---------------------\nDiEM25: https://www.youtube.com/c/DiEM25official\n\nSUPPORT\n---------------------\nJoin: https://diem25.org/join​\nDonate to DiEM25: https://diem25.org/donate",
