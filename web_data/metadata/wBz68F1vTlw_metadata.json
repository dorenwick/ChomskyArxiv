  "description": "Has Donald Trump peeled back the veil on America's toxicity?\n\nWhat will his second term mean for Israel, Palestine and the pursuit of justice?\n\nThis week on The Big Picture Podcast, we welcome back Norman Finkelstein, political scientist, author and legal scholar, to talk about the aftermath of the US elections, Israel’s war in Gaza and shifting tactics of the Palestine movement.\n\nFinkelstein has spent his career chronicling in excruciating detail the Israel-Palestine conflict from the perspective of international law, and feels that much of the conversation has framed it the wrong way. \n\nIt’s not that Israel is betraying the laws of war, it’s actually “following the logic of genocide”.\n\nHis most recent book ‘I’ll Burn That Bridge When I Get To It’ took a surprising turn, scrutinising the prevalence of identity politics and cancel culture, which Finkelstein argues has undermined movements for justice and left the space open for malicious actors.\n\n\nSubscribe and listen on all podcast platforms: https://thebigpicture.buzzsprout.com/\n\nMiddle East Eye Website: https://middleeasteye.net\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@middleeasteye\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/MiddleEastEye\nLike us on Facebook: https://facebook.com/MiddleEastEye\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye",
