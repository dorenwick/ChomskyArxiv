  "title": "Noam Chomsky Passes the Torch to the Last Generation",
  "description": "\"There are problems of extreme urgency that will be solved in the near future, or we're finished.\"\n\nIf you're an activist, linguist, or political analyst, then Noam Chomsky needs no introduction. But for anyone unfamiliar, Chomsky has shaped numerous generations of critical minds, and blazed the trail for organizations like ours attempting to change society at a systemic level.\n\nWe're thrilled to have him on our show, and to ask what he sees for our future (if we have one) as a new generation of activists take to the front lines. The short is answer is that he believes in us and our chances if we can take this challenge seriously enough, keep our minds open, and do everything in our power to tackle these crises together.\n\nOtherwise, all of the wisdom that he's shared with us will die with us, and the next generation may well be the last.\n\nFollow Moneyless Society on social media for more revolutionary ideas, and fill out the volunteer form in our bio there to join us in creating a post-capitalist future!\n\n*This interview was recorded in 2023 before Chomsky bowed out of public appearances*",
