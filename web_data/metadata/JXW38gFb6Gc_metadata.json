Given the recent developments on the transatlantic relationship between Europe, Germany and the U.S. as well as the rising nuclear threat between Russia & the U.S., acTVism has reproduced and is republishing this video to provide viewers historical context.\n\nFOLLOW US ONLINE:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/acTVism/\nInstagram: actv_munich\nWebsite: http://www.actvism.org/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/acTVismMunich\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/acTVismMunich/\n\n#chomsky #noamchomsky #manufacturingconsent",
