We will want one more thing:

A keyphrase_int_id,
and
A keyname_int_id,
and
A question_int_id,

Please go through those three relevant questions and pick up on them,
give them all ids in their field.

Then, we shall make the Works collection:

1 Works:
we include here, the full work, and all:
paragraph_int_ids, the source, the url, the keyphrases, the keynames, the questions, the topics, included
in the the whole work.

The schema will be:

work_int_id: int
all_paragraph_init_ids, (list of integers (pargraph int id))
source: str
url:
all_keyphrases: list items of str, int
all_keynames: list items of str, int
all_questions: list items of str, int
all_topics: list items of str, int

where list items of str, int is the actual string, and the int_id that is mapped to.



Afterwards, I want you to give me a summary report on how many works we have
of each type.

How many works we have in total.
How many questions we have in total.
How many keynames we have in total.
How many keyphrases we have in total.
How many paragraphs we have in total.
