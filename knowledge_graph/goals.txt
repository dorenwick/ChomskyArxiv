our goals here shall be to construct the knowledge graph of ChomskyArxiv.

Here, we plan the following schema:

first,

paragraph_int_id: (integer, automatically should increment)
type: (book, youtube, article, interview, debate, talk,...)
source: (name of book title, youtube video title, article title, interview, debate, talk, ect )
url: (chomsky.info link, youtube url, book url if theres an open url).
timestamp: (only applies if its a video)
location: (either a page number, or % of the way through the article, youtube video, book, ect.)
text: (the actual text of the paragraph)
keyphrases: [] (list of keyphrases we have)
keynames:  [] (list of people associated or talked about)
questions: [] (list of questions appearing in the article text).
answers: [] (list of answers appearing in the article text. we may have a question_id and answer_id to say which questions are being answered.)
topic: (topic that chomsky is talking about. we may use something like BERTopic to create our own topics, and topic classifier here).

is the current schema that we have.

We want to redo some of this as the paragraphs are too short.

We will want collections for the following:

1 Works:
we include here, the full work, and all:
paragraph_int_ids, the source, the url, the keyphrases, the keynames, the questions, the topics, included
in the the whole work.

The schema will be:

all_paragraph_init_ids, (list of integers (pargraph int id))
source: str
url:
all_keyphrases: list of str
all_keynames: list of str
all_questions: list of str
all_topics: list of str

2 Paragraphs:

we include here as documents

paragraph_int_id: (integer, automatically should increment)
type: (book, youtube, article, interview, debate, talk,...)
source: (name of book title, youtube video title, article title, interview, debate, talk, ect )
url: (chomsky.info link, youtube url, book url if theres an open url).
timestamp: (only applies if its a video)
location: (either a page number, or % of the way through the article, youtube video, book, ect.)
text: (the actual text of the paragraph)
keyphrases: [] (list of keyphrases we have)
keynames:  [] (list of people associated or talked about)
questions: [] (list of questions appearing in the article text).
answers: [] (list of answers appearing in the article text. we may have a question_id and answer_id to say which questions are being answered.)
topic: (topic that chomsky is talking about. we may use something like BERTopic to create our own topics, and topic classifier here).

Keyphrases:

The schema will be:

keyphrase: str
all_paragraph_init_ids: list of int


Keyname:

The schema will be:

keyname: str
all_paragraph_init_ids: list of int

Questions:

The schema will be:

question: str
all_paragraph_init_ids: list of int
